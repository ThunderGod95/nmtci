# Chapter 616: Dao Qiankun's Dao Seed

Hearing True Monarch Magnetic Pole's words, Zhang Yu smiled sheepishly and said, "It was all due to circumstances. You know my true passion has always been artifact refinement."

"Hmph."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole snorted coldly, gesturing with her chin toward the laboratory on the Flying Boat. "Let's go take a look at your lab."

Inside the laboratory, Liu Xiangqiao, Zi Yunzhen, and the others had been excitedly discussing Zhang Yu's performance in the Ten Greats League, marveling at the boundless potential of their lab's future. But the moment Zhang Yu entered with True Monarch Magnetic Pole, they fell silent, immediately focusing on their tasks.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole followed Zhang Yu on a tour of the laboratory, listening to his explanations about the various projects underway.

Currently, Zhang Yu's Artifact Refinement Laboratory housed preparations for the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor and the damaged Heavenly Sun Radiance God lying aside, awaiting repair. The twenty-four Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords were neatly arranged on the workbench, needing maintenance for the upcoming match.

"Alright," True Monarch Magnetic Pole said. "Leave the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor to me."

"Before the next competition begins, I'll refine this armor to Level 20 for you."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's eyes lit up immediately. "Master!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "No need to thank me. You'll still have to cover the material costs yourself."

"Besides, your gratitude means nothing. When I send you the bill, transferring the funds promptly will be far more appreciated than your thanks right now."

Zhang Yu nodded, then asked somewhat sheepishly, "Master, there's only a week until the next match, and my Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor is only at Level 10..."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled faintly. "Your master isn't just at the peak of the Nascent Soul realm; I've also cultivated artifact refinement techniques like the Grand Void Divine Artifact Strategy to Level 40."

"Moreover, a Level 10 Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor already has its basic framework and foundation established. Pushing it to Level 20 within a week will be a trivial matter for me."

Zhang Yu continued to smile and express his gratitude. He knew that for cultivators like True Monarch Magnetic Pole, every second was precious. For her to set aside her numerous duties to refine his magical artifact was already an immense favor.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole suddenly added, "Don't just thank me. If it weren't for Old Gao pestering me relentlessly, I wouldn't have bothered coming at all."

Zhang Yu's eyes flickered, and he quickly said, "I'll be sure to thank Director Gao properly when I get back."

For the following days, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's avatar remained in Zhang Yu's laboratory, assisting him daily in refining the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor. Meanwhile, Zhang Yu personally took charge of repairing the Heavenly Sun Radiance God and maintaining the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword.

Although the Heavenly Sun Radiance God had been severely damaged by Kuang Tianqing, Zhang Yu had managed to finalize an advertising deal with the Myriad Paths Artisan Sect. By selling all its advertising slots and naming rights to the sect, and with special consideration from the school, he secured nearly 300 Spirit Coins, more than enough to cover the repair costs.

At the same time, the school sent over several magical artifacts.

True Monarch Tranquility explained, "These were specially crafted based on your opponents' tactics in the previous match. They're primarily designed to detect fluctuations in spiritual energy, warn against Gu insects, and guard against Love Threads."

"While they can't directly counter these threats, they provide early warning, allowing you to prepare accordingly."

True Monarch Tranquility added a cautionary note: "Remember, we're not the only ones who can target our opponents. They'll be targeting us too."

"The Four Heavenly Demon Schools will undoubtedly devise strategies specifically targeting the tactics you used in the last match. You must remain vigilant."

As Zhang Yu gazed at the magical artifact True Monarch Tranquility had sent, a sense of awe stirred within him. He could already envision the Ten Great Universities engaging in an escalating arms race as the competition progressed, constantly adapting to each other's performance and pushing their students to new limits.

Shortly after, Zhang Yu received a package from Mo Shangjin. Through coordination between the school and the Civil Engineering Department, Mo Shangjin had leased the Seven Absolutes Bionic to Zhang Yu for use during the competition.

Gazing at the Seven Absolutes Bionic before him, the gradually perfecting Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor beside it, and the naming rights proposal the company had recently sent, Zhang Yu couldn't help but sigh inwardly. "The benefits from devouring Kuang Tianqing are truly overwhelming."

"In the next competition, my strength will far surpass my previous levels, bringing me even closer to the level of Dao Qiankun and Kuang Tianqing."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's Spirit Coin balance dwindled rapidly due to the repairs and refinement of magical artifacts and the rental of the Seven Absolutes Bionic. His account, originally flush with Spirit Coins and advertising revenue, now held a mere hundred-odd coins.

In Dao Qiankun's medicinal pool, Zhang Yu felt his dao heart growing increasingly refined, eventually fully recovering to Level 20.

"After soaking in Brother Dao's medicinal pool every day, at least it wasn't all for naught."

"I just wonder when I'll be able to leech his Dao Seed."

Zhang Yu turned to look at Dao Qiankun, who was standing not far away, gazing up at the starry sky in a daze.

For some reason, whenever Zhang Yu saw Dao Qiankun alone, he always sensed an overwhelming loneliness emanating from him, as if he were fundamentally out of place in the world.

Sensing Zhang Yu's gaze, Dao Qiankun turned his head and smiled. "What's up? Leaving already?"

Zhang Yu nodded, voicing a question that had been bothering him: "Brother Dao, why don't you have any advertisements on you during competitions?"

Given Dao Qiankun's fame, Zhang Yu couldn't believe his advertisement slots would go unsold.

Dao Qiankun replied calmly, "Zhang Yu, do you believe money... is all-powerful?"

Zhang Yu paused, slightly stunned by the question. As he pondered how to respond, Dao Qiankun continued, "I once had a close friend."

"He... was very weak, so he single-mindedly pursued power and wealth."

"In the process, he abandoned and lost many things."

"I couldn't bear to watch him continue down this path. I wanted him to understand that money isn't everything, that it can't solve every problem, and that there are many things money simply can't buy."

Zhang Yu was even more astonished by these words, which seemed completely out of character for someone from Kunxu.

Curiosity surged within Zhang Yu, and he asked, "What happened next?"

Dao Qiankun replied, "So, I devised a plan to help him earn vast sums of money — amounts he could never have dreamed of achieving before. He surpassed all his rivals."

"So, he finally realized money wasn't everything?" Zhang Yu thought.

Dao Qiankun shook his head. "Later, I discovered that money had indeed solved all his problems."

Zhang Yu: "......"

Dao Qiankun smiled at the silent Zhang Yu. "But money can't change... what I want to change: my friend's mindset."

"So, for my friend, money might truly be everything."

"But for me, it isn't."

"I also believe that many people have problems that money can't solve."

With a self-deprecating smile, Dao Qiankun asked, "Am I being a bit reckless? Would you say I'm squandering money?"

Zhang Yu immediately shook his head, his tone earnest. "Acting recklessly means exceeding your capabilities and being unable to take responsibility for the consequences. For example, if I did what you're doing and ended up buried in debt, that would be reckless. But you're operating entirely within your means, Senior. You're simply doing what you want to do."

Dao Qiankun smiled, looking at Zhang Yu. "Zhang Yu, if you were to take first place, which Immortal Sect Technique would you choose?"

Zhang Yu quickly replied, "Brother Dao, how could I possibly take first place? I'm here to help you take first place."

Dao Qiankun smiled faintly, and in a flash of lightning, he was standing before Zhang Yu. He grasped Zhang Yu's hand and pressed it against his chest, over his heart. "Just a hypothetical, I'm only speaking hypothetically."

"If you had the opportunity to pierce my heart like this, to secure first place, which Immortal Sect Technique would you want?"

Zhang Yu calmly replied, "Senior, that would be far too reckless for me."

Dao Qiankun smiled faintly and said, "I was just speaking hypothetically, Zhang Yu... your answer is far too boring."

"Though, I don't dislike it."

Dao Qiankun released Zhang Yu's wrist and declared proudly, "If I win first place, I'll take you to a new world and let you share in the glory of the champion."

Zhang Yu's gaze flickered with curiosity. "Senior, after claiming first place, which Immortal Sect Technique will you choose?"

Dao Qiankun walked to the window, gazing at the Myriad Laws Magical Artifact Long Night Jade Palace, which had transformed into the moon in the sky. His gaze seemed to pierce through the heavens, reaching deep into the cosmos.

"Every competitor in the Ten Greats League vying for the championship has a different cultivation art in mind."

"Some seek the legacy of Upper Realm Immortals to perfect their own techniques."

"Others aim to master the latest Immortal Dao Technology, striving to lead the world."

"Still others wish to break through their bottlenecks and transcend their limitations."

"As for me..."

"I want to change this world."

Looking at Dao Qiankun's chest, Zhang Yu's gaze flickered. He caught a fleeting glimpse of the Dao Seed's afterimage, barely discerning the character "仙" (Immortal).

The final day before the second match.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole had completely refined the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor.

Gazing at the Level 20 armor before him, Zhang Yu finally felt a surge of anticipation.

"What kind of cultivation art does the Great Sage's Heir possess?"

As Zhang Yu donned the armor, his Magic Power gradually flowed through it. The armor seemed to gradually become an extension of his body, participating in his vital functions...

Seeing Zhang Yu's dazed expression, True Monarch Magnetic Pole frowned and asked, "Zhang Yu? What's wrong? Is there something wrong with the armor?"

Zhang Yu snapped out of his reverie, a fleeting strange expression crossing his face. He turned to True Monarch Magnetic Pole and said, "No, Master. Your craftsmanship exceeds even my wildest expectations."

"With this armor, my strength has greatly increased. It's like a tiger gaining wings."

On the day of the second match, Zhang Yu donned the Seven Absolutes Bionic and the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, then headed toward the arena carrying his sword casket filled with magical artifacts.

A message from Bai Zhenzhen appeared in his Bionic Eye: Yu Zi, good luck!

Zhang Yu: Good luck!

Since the previous match, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had both been busy with their own affairs, and they hadn't even had a chance to see each other.

However, Zhang Yu knew that both he and Bai Zhenzhen were actively searching for an opportunity to truly connect — a chance to exchange Spiritual Roots.

With the conclusion of the first match, the universities were ranked by the number of prisoners they had captured. Myriad Laws, the top-ranked school, secured ten slots, while Pill Cauldron, at the bottom, received only one. In total, forty-five contestants were eliminated, leaving just fifty-five remaining in the arena.
