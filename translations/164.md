# Chapter 164: The Final Round, the Martial Arts Examination

On the other side of the examination hall.

As milky white sweat was continuously expelled from Yu Xinghan's body and evaporated by waves of heat emanating from within him, layers of white marks were left upon his skin.

During this process, Yu Xinghan gradually began to feel a discomfort originating from his body.

He knew that such a state of incomplete digestion could not be sustained for long.

If he kept forcing it, the burden on his digestive system would grow ever greater, eventually causing damage in return.

But as Yu Xinghan watched the situation, unable to pull away from Zhang Yu, he clenched his jaw and continued to frantically swallow and digest, maintaining his rank.

_This damned body, get it together!_

He fiercely slapped his own stomach, a defiant spirit surging within his heart.

_I am the Golden Core disciple, the personal disciple chosen by True Monarch Starfire. How can I lose to Zhang Yu…_

Although he usually appeared to chat and laugh with many students, the status of a Golden Core disciple had always instilled a trace of pride in Yu Xinghan's heart, making him understand that he was, after all, different from the other students.

Especially when facing Zhang Yu, a candidate he had personally eliminated back then, to say he felt no sense of superiority… that would be impossible.

It was just that this sense of superiority had been well hidden, particularly when Zhang Yu was paying him money.

But at this moment, as Yu Xinghan gave his all in this examination only to find that he still couldn't shake Zhang Yu, that sense of superiority transformed into threads of vexation.

"How can I lose to him?"

"I've received the training of a Golden Core True Monarch, and I spent so much money learning techniques from Zhang Yu…"

"How can I… lose to him?!"

Just as Yu Xinghan was about to fight it out with Zhang Yu to the very end, a sharp discomfort from his internal organs suddenly jolted him awake.

Feeling the distress in his organs, Yu Xinghan's mind suddenly recalled a few words from True Monarch Starfire.

"Xinghan, you cultivate the Heavenly Martial Heart-Tempering Art with me, forging an invincible will to fight and an endless fighting spirit, which is a good thing."

"But in this world, there is always someone better, and a heaven beyond the heavens. Who dares claim a life undefeated? Who can come and go unrivaled?"

"When you encounter that person who is better, that heaven beyond the heavens, this endless fighting spirit might instead harm you, causing you to suffer defeat upon defeat."

With a sigh, True Monarch Starfire had spoken with immense world-weariness, "When it's time to let go, just let go."

"Defeat is not frightening."

"As long as the money is still there, there will be countless more opportunities."

"I will leave these words in your mind today, only hoping they might be of use one day in the future."

As True Monarch Starfire's words flashed through Yu Xinghan's mind, his mind, once filled with fighting spirit, abruptly calmed down and quickly accepted a certain fact.

_Zhang Yu… has indeed surpassed me._

_Judging by this examination, at least in terms of physical techniques, he is already completely above me, having thoroughly surpassed me to the point where I have no power to retaliate._

Though it was difficult, though he was unwilling, Yu Xinghan knew that a fact was a fact, and he had to admit it.

_If I continue to force it, once my digestive system can no longer handle this overloaded state, my eating speed will plummet, and I might not even be able to hold on to a top 20 position._

Exhaling mentally, Yu Xinghan knew it was time to let go.

In the next moment, milky white sweat ceased to flow from his body, and he returned to a normal state of eating.

A moment later, on the light screen, the pillar representing Zhang Yu as number 55 surpassed Yu Xinghan, moving into 15th place.

Seeing this, Yu Xinghan once again let out a deep breath in his heart, constantly telling himself it was all right.

_It’s fine to lose. As long as the money is still there, there's a chance to catch up._

Watching Yu Xinghan give up, Huang Zichou commented with appreciation, "I didn't expect this Golden Core disciple to be able to let go in time. He has managed to secure his current ranking."

Another minor god lamented, "It's simple to desperately charge upward."

"But to know when to slow down, to know your own limits even when you're in the spotlight, to know what debts you can't owe and what contracts you can't sign—that's not so easy."

Observing this scene, Deng Bingding thought to herself, _It seems that after Starfire, that little rascal, fell to the first layer, he not only reflected on himself but also disciplined his apprentice well._

_Unfortunately, he's become a better person, but his money is gone. What use is that?_

Just then, as the competition gradually neared its end, Huang Zichou said, "Lady Deng, this round of the Battle of Gluttony has proceeded smoothly. The contestants have each displayed their unique abilities. It is clear that the Immortal Dao education on the first layer of Kunxu is flourishing day by day."

Another minor god, while recording the scene as material for his report, praised, "I still remember the earliest Foundation Establishment exams, where students just had to compete in physical strength."

"Only later were there refined tests for power, speed, and various techniques."

"And look at it now."

The gods looked at the students on the field; some were emitting smoke from their entire bodies, some had stomachs bloated larger than their bodies, some went to the toilet once a minute, some were frantically beating themselves to produce thunderous sounds, some had bodies vibrating like blenders, and some were vomiting and then stuffing the vomit back into their mouths…

Deng Bingding nodded with a smile and said, "The students now are stronger with each generation. It can be said that the Immortal Dao is prosperous, a blessing for the world."

Huang Zichou quickly added, "It is all thanks to the proper guidance of the Heavenly Court, and the righteous gods of the various ministries, like yourself, Lady Deng, who care for the common people."

Deng Bingding smiled faintly. "Take good pictures of these athletic competitors on the field, pick a few to report up, so that the great lords above can also see the vibrant vitality of Kunxu's first layer…"

Huang Zichou immediately complied. He knew well that the great gods of the various ministries, as well as the immortals in the Heavenly Court, most loved to see these descendants of the Immortal Dao striving competitively, bravely climbing the path of immortality.

As the Battle of Gluttony concluded, the rankings were finalized.

Many students didn't have time to look at the rankings and were already rushing toward the toilets.

Ye Lingxiao, however, stood firmly in place. He looked at his second-place rank, and then at Yun Jing in first, and a cold light seemed to flash in his eyes.

As if sensing Ye Lingxiao's hostility, Yun Jing smiled at him and said, "You won the last round. It's only fair I win this one back."

"The perfect bloodline of the Ye clan doesn't seem so perfect after all, does it? At least in eating, it seems it's no match for my Cauldron-style Digestive System."

Ye Lingxiao did not reply, but the intense desire to win in his eyes said it all; he was determined to win the third round back.

Ye Lingxiao thought to himself, _Before, because of the clan, the company, the stock price, the advertisements… I could never have a decisive battle with this guy Yun Jing._

_Now, on this Foundation Establishment examination ground, I can finally fight him without holding back._

Dai Xingzhi looked at his 7th place ranking and revealed a satisfied smile, thinking that he probably wouldn't be eliminated from today's Foundation Establishment examination.

He then glanced at Meng Tao, who possessed the Gluttony spiritual root and had fallen to 10th place, and then at Zhang Yu, who had rushed up to 14th place, a trace of doubt rising in his heart.

_This outsider, number 55… he should be very wealthy, right? But why 14th place this time?_

_Is he doing it on purpose again?_

He recalled Zhang Yu's performance during the competition and shook his head slightly. _It doesn't seem like it._

_And his digestive system didn't seem particularly special either._

Dai Xingzhi looked at Zhang Yu with curiosity. "Could it be that this guy's strength isn't actually as formidable as I previously imagined?"

And it was clear that Dai Xingzhi was not the only one on site thinking this. The gazes of many students toward Zhang Yu now carried a hint of doubt.

Huang Zichou commented, "It's still Ye Lingxiao and Yun Jing who are in a league of their own."

"The other top-ranked students are also all from the Immortal Capital."

"It seems the four Foundation Establishment certificates for this session will once again be claimed by people from the Immortal Capital."

"As for those three from Songyang…"

Looking at Zhang Yu in 14th, Yu Xinghan in 16th, and Bai Zhenzhen in 20th, Huang Zichou remarked with a sigh, "They have great potential. In next year's Foundation Establishment examination, they might have a chance to touch a certificate."

But at the same time, the righteous gods, including Huang Zichou and Deng Bingding, were all muttering to themselves, wondering what had happened in Songyang to suddenly produce three students with the potential to test for a Foundation Establishment certificate.

_But what does it have to do with me,_ Huang Zichou thought. _I'm just responsible for their Foundation Establishment exam._

After a period of rest.

The third and final examination of the day officially arrived.

Deng Bingding announced in a clear voice, "The Martial Arts Examination tests one's personal mastery and understanding of martial arts techniques."

"It can be said that a person's martial arts cultivation is not only reflected in actual combat; the process of learning a cultivation technique can reflect it just as well…"

Huang Zichou secretly curled his lip. _This is just to save on the budget. The Heavenly Court and the Eight Ministries of Righteous Gods pity the examinees of the lower realms, so in past Foundation Establishment exams on Kunxu's first layer, the medical fees for combat assessments were always covered._

_The great lords just flap their lips and cover the medical fees with a single sentence, but don't we down below have to scrape together the shortfall?_

_If we don't eliminate more people and let so many students engage in combat this early, getting beaten to a bloody pulp, who knows how much money that would cost._

With a clap of Deng Bingding's hands, a light screen materialized in front of each student.

"For this martial arts examination, you will each select a cultivation technique and spend the next two hours comprehending and cultivating it."

"These cultivation techniques have been ranked by us according to difficulty, with one-star being the easiest and ten-star being the most difficult."

"The higher the difficulty of the technique you master, the higher your score will naturally be."

"But if you are unable to master the selected technique, you will receive 0 points for this round."

"Additionally, the reward cultivation technique for today's exam will be the one you select."

"If you do not make it into the top 20 of the total score and are to be eliminated… then you will also have to pay for the cost of the cultivation technique yourselves."
