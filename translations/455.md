# Chapter 455: President Wang

The Spirit Realm trembled violently as waves of astonishing pressure surged from the artifact spirit's core, enveloping all the teachers and students present.

Simultaneously, the artifact spirit's voice multiplied into a hundred layered echoes, resonating through their ears, hearts, and minds like a massive stone dropped into a pond, creating tumultuous ripples across their inner landscapes.

"What joy is there in life? What bitterness in death?"

"Shed this decaying body and be reborn through reincarnation."

"Today, sever your path to Immortality and leap forth as a carefree dragon among the clouds..."

The artifact spirit murmured, "You struggle daily in this world, clinging to scraps that fall from the Immortals' fingers. Centuries of arduous cultivation ultimately reduce you to wisps of lingering souls, your joys and sorrows destined to return to dust!"

"Everything you do today merely transforms you into sustenance for the Immortals!"

"Why not embrace reincarnation sooner? Be reborn into a new life?"

"Re-enter the cycle, find a fortunate womb — wouldn't that surpass a hundred years of toil?"

At that moment, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's cold voice rang out. The Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda materialized in the Spirit Realm, instantly suppressing the flow of information.

A faint chime echoed through the Spirit Realm, instantly snapping the students out of their daze from listening to the artifact spirit's whispers.

Yan Qianji stared in shock at the artifact spirit, thinking, "Even after being jointly suppressed by several Teachers, it still possesses such a seductive power?"

His eyes lit up as he exclaimed, "As expected of an artifact spirit crafted by a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch! If we can successfully decipher it, we'll surely uncover Joyful Union University's breakthroughs in artifact spirit technology over the years!"

Meanwhile, Ye Xingli replayed the artifact spirit's whispers in her mind, thinking, "This is..."

At that moment, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's icy voice cut through the Spirit Realm, reaching the minds of everyone present: "That fiend just used a vile technique from the Feather Transformation Demonic Sect! Its teachings are nothing but twisted lies and heretical doctrines!"

"This artifact spirit has been thoroughly corrupted and its mind has gone completely mad. Do not be influenced by it!"

As she spoke, the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda blazed with light, completely silencing the artifact spirit's whispers.

Simultaneously, countless bizarre patterns surfaced on the surface of the artifact spirit's statue form, shifting like living talismans and revealing endless intricate details.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole commanded, "This artifact spirit has sealed itself, attempting to protect itself with internal restrictions. Join me in breaking these seals..."

In an instant, True Monarch Magnetic Pole reached out and grabbed, and a torrent of talismans poured forth from the artifact spirit's interior, surging toward the students and teachers present!

Zhang Pianpian watched the talismans rush toward her and immediately began dismantling them one by one.

Yan Qianji, standing beside her, glanced over and remarked, "Your talisman skills are impressive, and you're remarkably adept at dismantling artifact spirits!"

Zhang Pianpian replied calmly, "Talismans were originally methods for channeling divine power. As the network of divine power expanded, they gradually became the common currency of the Spirit Realm, eventually being applied to artifact spirit technology. It's only natural that our department excels at dealing with artifact spirits."

"But your talisman skills are also quite advanced," she added, "far beyond what one would expect from an artifact crafting student!"

Yan Qianji laughed heartily. "How can artifact crafters produce magical artifacts or Bionics with even the most basic intelligence to meet market demands if they don't master talismans?"

Just then, the talismans before them began shifting a hundred times faster than before, and the expressions of everyone present turned grave.

In the office, Director Gao smiled at Zhang Yu and nodded. "You rascal! I thought you'd spend at least a few days practicing the Earth Essence Art and studying the Comprehensive Manual of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering before uniting them and comprehending the mysteries of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power!"

"Yet you mastered it overnight!"

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback. "The Seven Absolutes have a Comprehensive Manual?"

Director Gao sighed. "Of course! Do you think everyone possesses your talent to forcibly unite the Seven Absolutes and cultivate this peerless martial art?"

"Moreover, don't you feel that your grasp of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power is still incomplete?"

"The Seven Absolutes Compendium not only explains the profound principles of uniting the Seven Absolutes but, more importantly, records the application methods for the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power painstakingly developed by our predecessors!"

Listening to Director Gao's words, Zhang Yu was mildly surprised. He recalled how, after pushing the Earth Essence Art to level 5 overnight, he had sensed a natural synergy between the Seven Absolutes.

A breakthrough!

Zhang Yu mused, Could it be that reaching Level 20 in the other Six Absolutes has allowed me to grasp the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering to the limit of the Foundation Establishment Stage, aside from the Earth Essence Art? Is that why this sudden enlightenment?

As Zhang Yu pondered, Director Gao continued, "Now that you've mastered all Seven Absolutes, I've applied for access to the Comprehensive Manual and am granting it to you."

"Although you've united the Seven Absolutes and cultivated the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, the manual still contains crucial details you must meticulously study."

"Pay special attention to the application methods summarized by generations of predecessors, known as the Ten Phases of Suppressing Stars. While these are merely techniques, not true cultivation arts, they will greatly enhance your mastery of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. Delve into them carefully..."

Director Gao then provided further guidance, explaining key points in the Comprehensive Manual. Over two hours later, he finally dismissed Zhang Yu.

Before Zhang Yu left, Director Gao added, "One last thing before you go..."

"Now that you've mastered a military-grade cultivation technique, you'll be able to take on projects you couldn't before!"

"I'll help you arrange those opportunities, and your income will definitely increase significantly!"

"But remember, don't squander your earnings. Avoid risky investments you're not confident in. Ping Han serves as a cautionary tale..."

After finally enduring Director Gao's lecture, Zhang Yu walked away, reviewing the Seven Absolutes Compendium in his mind. When the Seven Absolutes are united and executed in perfect coordination, they transform into the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power!

The average level of my Seven Absolutes is roughly the level that the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power can propel!

Based on the current level of my Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering, the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power I can unleash would likely be around level 17 or 18 in potency!

Zhang Yu then examined the application methods within the compendium. Ten Phases of Suppressing Stars... It's just a set of techniques, not a true cultivation art!

Looks like I'll have to practice it during my work on construction sites.

Suddenly, Zhang Yu's eyes widened. I forgot to ask about the Bionics!

Zhang Yu quickly sent a message: "Teacher Gao, can I apply for the blueprints for the remaining four Seven Absolutes Bionics?"

Director Gao replied: "You still need to follow the proper procedures."

"However, since you've already mastered the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering and passed the tests for the remaining four Civil Engineering Techniques, I'll expedite your application."

"For each test you pass, you'll be eligible to apply for another Bionic."

Netherworld University, inside the Skinworking Factory.

Ye Lingxiao channeled his Magic Power to operate the machinery, refining the "human skin" before him.

But Ye Lingxiao knew this wasn't real human skin. The boss had acquired fake skin from somewhere, using it to produce substandard Immortal Dao magical artifacts.

Ye Lingxiao had no intention of reporting it. While reporting might be harmless in a clean operation, this was clearly a shady business.

Just then, a message arrived in his Bionic Eye, and he smirked inwardly. "Zhang Yu surrendered first in the Civil Engineering Competition? He lost?"

The message came from a friend at Myriad Laws University, someone Ye Lingxiao considered highly reliable.

He thought to himself, "President Wang will be thrilled to hear this!"

Ye Lingxiao sent the message, expecting Wang Yin to be delighted. Instead, Wang Yin replied, "What's there to be happy about?"

Ye Lingxiao: "Zhang Yu lost!"

Wang Yin: "So what if Zhang Yu lost? Only his victory would validate the significance of my defeat!"

Wang Yin: "The more he wins, the more it strengthens my Dao Heart and accelerates my cultivation in the Immortal Dao!"

Hearing this, Ye Lingxiao secretly admired Wang Yin's unwavering Dao Heart while feeling ashamed of his own petty gloating.

Wang Yin: "Besides, do I need you to tell me about Zhang Yu? I can see his posts myself!"

Wang Yin: "Your information is outdated!"

Wang Yin: "Zhang Yu has already mastered the military-grade martial art, the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power!"

Ye Lingxiao stared at the screenshot Wang Yin sent: Zhang Yu hanging upside down in the sky, announcing his mastery of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

Ye Lingxiao gasped. He couldn't believe that the country bumpkin he had once looked down upon in the First Layer had now become someone he could only gaze up at in awe — someone he might never catch up to.

Wang Yin: Don't presume to understand my Dao Heart based on your own cultivation realm!

Wang Yin: Don't bother telling me about Zhang Yu's failures in the future.

Wang Yin: Just inform me of his victories!

Reading Wang Yin's response, Ye Lingxiao couldn't help but marvel at the President's formidable Dao Heart.

"Zhang Yu... President Wang..." Witnessing Zhang Yu's achievements and President Wang's reaction, Ye Lingxiao recalled his own recent actions and felt like a fool.

"I need to elevate my own spiritual realm!"

"Otherwise, the gap between us will only widen!"

With renewed resolve, Ye Lingxiao decided to re-add Zhang Yu as a friend.

However, remembering how Zhang Yu had previously added him to contact President Wang, only to be blocked by Ye Lingxiao, he began pondering how to apologize.

Just then, lines of notifications appeared in Ye Lingxiao's bionic eye:

"Your work efficiency has decreased by more than five minutes. Please focus and concentrate on your tasks!"

The notification snapped Ye Lingxiao back to reality. He banished all distracting thoughts and threw himself into his work with renewed focus.

"For now, I should concentrate on the present and focus on putting in some overtime!"
