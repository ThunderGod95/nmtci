# Chapter 507: When Did You Start?

Observing the changing expression on Nine Heavens Liu's face, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "He's getting anxious?"

Nine Heavens Liu, however, was genuinely baffled. He couldn't comprehend how Zhang Yu dared to bring up the Sect.

Entering the Sect... was that even something you could dream of? Something you deserved to dream of?

But in the next moment, Nine Heavens Liu realized, "This guy... he's probably just using the Sect as a smokescreen to demand an exorbitant price."

With a cold smile, Nine Heavens Liu continued walking forward with Zhang Yu, murmuring, "Every Heavenly Chosen who enters the Sect is a true child of destiny. Their fate to join the Sect was sealed even before they were born."

Zhang Yu exclaimed in surprise, "Before they were born?"

He had previously thought that some wealthy individuals being born with advantages that surpassed countless others was already remarkable. But now Nine Heavens Liu was telling him that some people's Sect membership was predetermined even before their birth?

Nine Heavens Liu said calmly, "Some are born with the Qi Luck of Heaven and Earth. From their parents' generation, it was already decided that they would enter the Sect. Even a single strand of their hair is infinitely more esteemed than you."

"Others have endured two lifetimes of arduous cultivation, their foundations already a thousand or ten thousand times greater than yours. With their extraordinary abilities that transcend the mortal realm, they gain entry to the Sect."

"And then there are those... born from the spiritual essence of Heaven and Earth, nourished by the yin and yang energies. Their positions within the Sect were determined long before their birth."

Nine Heavens Liu turned to look at Zhang Yu as if he were a child who had spoken out of turn. He said mildly, "If this were two hundred years ago, your current level might have been enough to enter the Sect. But with the Immortal Dao Technology of that era, could you have reached this level at your age?"

"Now, whether you can enter the Sect is decided before you're even born. What right do you have to compete?"

At this point, Nine Heavens Liu shifted his tone, offering consolation. "However, not entering the Sect isn't necessarily a bad thing. Staying below has its own kind of freedom..."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "If it's so carefree down here, why don't you go to the First Layer?"

Nine Heavens Liu, unaware of Zhang Yu's thoughts, continued, "With the Finance Department's support, the heights you could reach would far surpass your wildest dreams."

"Once you join us, we'll channel Qi Luck to you, guaranteeing at least a hundred trending topics annually and daily exposure exceeding a million views. We'll make your name known throughout Myriad Laws University and beyond, establishing you as a top influencer in your niche, your Qi Luck soaring to the heavens."

"Leveraging the Finance Department's connections, countless businesses will seek partnerships with you, securing massive advertising deals and monetizing your Qi Luck. This will ensure you face no financial obstacles on your path to the Nascent Soul stage."

"We also offer traffic support. Even if Divine Monarch Jade Nectar suppresses your visibility, we can use the Eight Righteous Gods to investigate the situation and even lift the restrictions..."

Zhang Yu asked, "Is joining a Sect truly impossible?"

Nine Heavens Liu chuckled in exasperation, pointing at Zhang Yu. "Stop using the Sect as leverage. The offer we're making today is unmatched by any other department — not the Artifact Refinement Department, and certainly not the Civil Engineering Department."

"If anyone claims they can help you enter the Sect, there's only one possibility: they're lying to you."

"Because no one but a liar could possibly fulfill your demands."

Regardless of Nine Heavens Liu's words, Zhang Yu understood that joining the Finance Department was impossible.

After all, the Finance Department's methods — gambling on finance, manipulating Qi Luck, exploiting trends, leveraging high-risk investments, and engaging in insider trading — were fundamentally incompatible with his strengths. He simply couldn't excel in that environment.

In contrast, the Artifact Refinement Department would not only better leverage his strengths and allow him to achieve greater success, but True Monarch Magnetic Pole had also shown him immense kindness through her mentorship. Moreover, his ongoing research project on the Soul Transformation Bionic remained under her supervision.

Whether considering it rationally, from a long-term perspective, or through personal sentiment, the Finance Department held far less appeal for Zhang Yu than the Artifact Refinement Department.

Overall, joining the Artifact Refinement Department would significantly increase his chances of successfully entering the Sect in the future.

Seeing Zhang Yu's unwavering resolve, Nine Heavens Liu realized that the task entrusted to him by his Senior Brother was about to fall apart. His expression darkened slightly.

Nine Heavens Liu said coldly, "Zhang Yu, I advise you to reconsider your answer today."

"Your loans, your Qi Luck trends, your company's projects... all are connected to the Finance Department."

"As far as I know, you and your company have very little money left, right?"

Zhang Yu understood that Nine Heavens Liu was making a blatant threat.

Perhaps after this rejection, he would be denied loans, or even have his Qi Luck plundered? His company's operations might also face difficulties?

But Zhang Yu still shook his head. "I'm sorry, I really have no interest in the Finance Department."

Watching Zhang Yu's retreating figure, Nine Heavens Liu's eyes flickered with disbelief and anger at being rejected.

Since joining the Finance Department, Nine Heavens Liu had been the center of attention wherever he went. Countless people surrounded him, flattering him, all for a mere sliver of the department's resources.

He had always been the one representing the Finance Department to reject others. When had anyone ever rejected their investment?

"Zhang Yu..."

Nine Heavens Liu shook his head, muttering, "Fool."

Shortly after Zhang Yu left the Finance Department, messages began flashing across his Bionic Eye.

They all reported that projects handled by his company were facing setbacks, with partners temporarily suspending cooperation.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "So it begins?"

He knew that many construction companies in the Civil Engineering Department relied on loans from the Finance Department or took on projects from the Finance Department's real estate companies.

Even a minor financial fluctuation, a change in workflow, or a delay in project payments could result in massive losses for these construction firms.

Zhang Yu understood that the Finance Department could sever cooperation with Civil Engineering's construction companies with a single word, and even Director Gao would struggle to prevent it.

At the same time, Ying Xin sent him a message.

Ying Xin: "Boss, the company's accounts are empty. We haven't been able to pay the employees' wages for the past two days."

Ying Xin: "They also asked me to ask you why the projects suddenly stopped?"

Shortly after Zhang Yu left, the Civil Engineering Department's banquet also broke up on an unhappy note.

At that very moment, Director Gao's projection materialized in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's office.

"Your earlier warning was correct," Director Gao said, looking at True Monarch Magnetic Pole. "The Finance Department has indeed set its sights on Zhang Yu."

"Unfortunately, even though I accelerated my plans, they still managed to interfere."

"Those guys are taking this matter even more seriously than I originally anticipated."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole understood the Finance Department's heightened interest all too well. After all, she had been the one who, through True Monarch Celestial Seal, had repeatedly publicized the progress of the Soul Transformation Bionic experiments, constantly highlighting Zhang Yu's importance and provoking the Finance Department.

"Aren't you worried that after visiting the Finance Department, Zhang Yu might just join them?" True Monarch Magnetic Pole asked.

Director Gao's mind flashed back to the scene of Zhang Yu rejecting True Monarch Chain Nexus. He sighed, "He's got more guts and more brains than I did at his age."

"I believe he won't be easily intimidated by the Finance Department."

"But even if he stays in Civil Engineering, I can't protect him."

Director Gao's Bionic Eye displayed news of project suspensions affecting Zhang Yu's company.

Director Gao understood this was just the beginning. Without proper protection, Zhang Yu would face increasingly relentless attacks from the Finance Department.

Throughout Myriad Laws University's history, there had been instances of brilliant students who rose to prominence only to be crushed by the Finance Department.

With this in mind, Director Gao turned to True Monarch Magnetic Pole and said, "Magnetic Pole, take Zhang Yu under your wing. Only you can protect him."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed. "But he's your carefully nurtured disciple. How could I possibly..."

Director Gao suddenly interjected, "Zhang Yu has wanted to join the Artifact Refinement Department for a long time, hasn't he?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Why do you say that?"

Director Gao: "I've noticed him studying artifact crafting techniques."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "It's not unusual for students in the Civil Engineering Department to study some artifact crafting techniques. They'll need them to operate magical artifacts and maintain Bionics in the future."

Director Gao interrupted, "When did this start?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "What do you mean?"

Director Gao: "Was it that time... when I asked you to guide Zhang Yu during the Civil Engineering Competition? Did you take a liking to him then?"

"Or was it when I asked you to help him craft a magical artifact?"

"Or perhaps after he obtained his Military Certificate, when I discussed him with you?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "Old Gao, don't overthink it. Zhang Yu's talent and aptitude are indeed remarkable, but they can't compare to our friendship. If you want him to stay in the Civil Engineering Department, I can help you."

Director Gao chuckled wryly. "Force him to stay in Civil Engineering now? Watch him be constantly suppressed by the Finance Department? Wouldn't he resent me for life?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole gazed intently at Director Gao. "Chongguang, are you angry?"

"Angry?" Director Gao said flatly. "What right does someone from the Civil Engineering Department have to be angry?"

"Besides, you've given me plenty of face this time. How could I possibly be angry with you? You're the top authority in the Artifact Refinement Department — how dare I be angry with you?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed. "Ah, Chongguang, things aren't as simple as you think."

Just then, Zhang Yu's avatar materialized in the air, indicating that he had arrived at the door and was requesting entry.

Director Gao: "He's here to see you."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "I asked him to come."

As she spoke, the office door opened, and Zhang Yu walked in.

However, due to True Monarch Magnetic Pole's deliberate interference, Zhang Yu couldn't see Director Gao, while Director Gao could clearly see both Zhang Yu and True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole beckoned Zhang Yu closer and asked, "How was your visit to the Finance Department?"

Zhang Yu immediately recounted his entire experience visiting the Finance Department, explaining everything in detail to True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

At that moment, True Monarch Magnetic Pole ruffled Zhang Yu's hair and asked, "You turned down the Finance Department's invitation?"
