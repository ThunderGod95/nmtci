# Chapter 503: Civil Engineering Champion

As the competition concluded, Zhang Yu had his original limbs reattached, while Mo Shangjin retrieved the Seven Absolutes Bionic from the battlefield.

The doctor, eyeing Zhang Yu's battered body, asked again, "Are you sure you don't need treatment?"

Zhang Yu shook his head. "Just reattach the parts of my body that were replaced by the Bionic."

"As for the injuries from the competition, you don't need to worry about them."

Zhang Yu had no intention of wasting money on medical treatment. Who knew how much they'd charge!

Even without treating the injuries, the Bionic transplant was costly. The differences between Mo Shangjin and Zhang Yu's physical bodies, the urgent need for speed and timing, and Zhang Yu's enhanced physical strength further complicated the procedure.

These factors drove the transplant cost to nearly 8 Spirit Coins, draining Zhang Yu's savings from just under 10 Spirit Coins to less than 2!

After all, he had spent a considerable amount of money upgrading his magical artifacts to increase his chances of victory in battle.

Judging by the results, the investment had been worthwhile.

The Gang Qi enhanced by the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill had significantly extended his endurance against Xiang Shan.

While other artifacts, including the Golden Jade Wall, hadn't proven effective in direct combat against Xiang Shan, they had greatly improved the efficiency of his team's construction efforts, ultimately boosting the company's future profits.

"The repair costs for the Seven Absolutes Bionic will probably be another 5 to 10 Spirit Coins," Zhang Yu sighed, resigning himself to owing Mo Shangjin for now.

Despite the substantial expenses, Zhang Yu now considered it all worthwhile.

Securing the championship in the Civil Engineering Competition would grant him the design blueprints for Military-Grade Armor and secure his transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department, instantly broadening his path to future cultivation.

As his arms and other body parts were reattached one by one, the Four-Headed White Bull roared in his mind. Activated flesh and blood, infused with his will, fused tightly together, temporarily sealing the wounds across his body.

After a brief wait, the group participated in the awards ceremony.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Zhang Yu led the Myriad Laws University team onto the champion's podium.

Whether it was Mo Shangjin, a seasoned competitor, or Su Yanyang and the others participating for the first time, their hearts surged with emotion, unable to conceal their excitement. This was the first time in their lives they had won a cross-university championship!

"Finally, we've taken first place!" Mo Shangjin thought to himself. "Now I can graduate without any regrets!"

Shi Huaiyu mused, "With this achievement on my resume, it'll be a huge boost for both job hunting and graduate school applications!"

The thought filled Shi Huaiyu with optimism, making her future path seem suddenly bright and promising.

Su Yanyang sighed inwardly, "If Zhang Yu stays in the Civil Engineering Department next year, we could coast to another victory! What a pity..."

Meanwhile, in the Spirit Realm, the Soul Cultivators watched the scene with fervent excitement.

Zhao Tianxing exclaimed, "I never thought I'd see the day!"

Mo Tianyi exclaimed excitedly, "Even though we're just Junior College students, our resumes today are something most students from the Ten Greats universities don't have!"

Ying Xin's elders gathered together, laughing. "Who would have thought that we'd get a piece of a cross-school championship, something we never dared to dream of when we were alive!"

Che Yufei gazed longingly at the awards podium, snapping extra photos, thinking, "I'll Photoshop myself in later!"

Just then, Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye scanned the Spirit Realm, seemingly noticing the Soul Cultivators' attention. He called out, "You guys come up too!"

Zhao Tianxing exclaimed in surprise, "Me... us?"

Zhang Yu smiled. "You participated in the competition too, right? Come join us for the awards ceremony and photos!"

Before Zhao Tianxing could react, Ying Xin's Grandfather had already flashed behind Zhang Yu, and Che Yufei squeezed in beside him!

The Soul Cultivators crowded behind the Myriad Laws University team, instantly filling the awards podium to capacity, making it look like it was packed with people!

Hu Yuntao hesitated for a moment before finally stepping onto the stage.

"Fuck it, I'm going all in! I'm not staying at Celestial Monsters University anyway!"

As he gazed at the countless Monsterfolk watching from the venue and the Spirit Realm, Hu Yuntao felt more dazzling than ever before.

Zhao Tianxing frantically spent Spirit Coins to increase his pixel count and enlarge the font size of his name, determined to stand out clearly in the group photo.

His only thought at that moment was: "The second I get this photo, I'm posting it on my Spirit Realm Moments!"

On the other end of the Spirit Realm Network, Xiong Wenwu stared at the scene in mild surprise.

"What are you laughing at?" asked another Bear Monster beside Hu Yuntao.

Xiong Wenwu replied with a sigh, "My high school friend won the Civil Engineering Competition!"

The other Bear Monster let out a surprised "Oh!" and was about to ask more when their boss called them away. Together, they began carrying their master to work.

True Monarch Celestial Elephant glanced at the Myriad Laws University group on stage, and a flicker of surprise crossed his eyes as he noticed the Soul Cultivators behind them.

This was the first time he had ever seen anyone bring Soul Cultivators up for an award ceremony and group photo!

Shaking his head, True Monarch Celestial Elephant walked to the podium to present the awards.

He looked at Zhang Yu and said calmly, "It's hard to believe that just six months ago, you were a student who hadn't even obtained your Military Certificate. Yet in such a short time, you've become the strongest Civil Engineering student!"

Zhang Yu replied humbly, "True Monarch, you flatter me!"

At that moment, a chorus of boos erupted from the arena. A swarm of Monsterfolk spewed forth various foul substances radiating intense fiend energy, hurling them directly at Zhang Yu and his team.

Clearly, a significant portion of the Monsterfolk harbored deep resentment toward Myriad Laws University.

However, these mere projectiles posed no threat to the Myriad Laws University group, who easily deflected them.

True Monarch Celestial Elephant then presented the design blueprints and usage authorization for the Military-Grade Armor, the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, to Myriad Laws University and the winning team.

With these blueprints and authorization, Myriad Laws University could now manufacture and research the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor.

The team members could also commission the creation of this Military-Grade Armor.

Of course, to actually use the Military-Grade Armor, a Military Certificate would still be required.

But having secured these blueprints, Myriad Laws University would undoubtedly offer additional rewards to the team.

Zhang Yu eagerly glanced at the blueprint, thinking to himself, "Once I transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department, I'll definitely study this blueprint thoroughly. I need to figure out why the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor is included in the Chain Method Diagram Set!"

Meanwhile, on the second-place podium, Xiang Shan stood alone, a solitary figure.

At that moment, countless flashing messages flooded his Bionic Eye:

"Why don't you just die?"

"Give the money back."

"If I were you, I'd drop out."

Across the Celestial Monsters University's Spirit Realm Network, countless Monsterfolk hurled insults and curses at Xiang Shan.

The audience glared at him with fury.

His teammates demanded compensation for the cost of reviving their physical bodies.

His clan members departed one by one, their faces expressionless, heading back to work overtime to make up for the lost time.

Though the arena was packed with people, Xiang Shan felt an unprecedented sense of isolation.

Just moments ago, he had commanded the battlefield like a storm, cheered on by countless Monsterfolk supporters. Now, he was utterly desolate, despised by the very same crowd.

As the award ceremony concluded, the Myriad Laws University team began their journey home.

Even while still on the Flying Boat, news of their victory had already reached Myriad Laws University, and the team members immediately received countless congratulations from their teachers and fellow students.

When the group finally returned to Myriad Laws University after traversing thousands of kilometers, they were immediately whisked away to a celebratory banquet.

Before they even entered the banquet hall, waves of rich aromas — savory meats and fragrant dishes — assailed their senses, making their mouths water.

Stepping inside, they found the air thick with congratulatory messages celebrating the Civil Engineering Department's championship victory.

In addition to well-wishes from departments like Security, Pharmacology, and Artifact Refinement, Zhang Yu even spotted messages from several Vice Principals.

Mo Shangjin chuckled beside him. "It's been years since we last won the championship. Now that we've achieved such a remarkable feat, the teachers decided to throw a banquet to celebrate!"

Shi Huaiyu smiled. "After all, this is Director Gao's first major success since taking charge of the Civil Engineering Department!"

As Zhang Yu and his group entered the hall, countless eyes turned toward them.

He recognized faces like Ma Xuan and Gongshu Jin from the Civil Engineering Department, Feng Tingting, who had transferred from Artifact Refinement, and top students from Artifact Refinement like Yan Qianji and Ye Xingli.

In addition to Civil Engineering Department faculty like Tu Lishan and Lang Yougong, numerous teachers and professors from other departments had also been invited.

Zhang Yu even spotted True Monarch Cloud Haven, the Vice Principal overseeing academic affairs, who had projected a Spirit Realm Projection to converse animatedly with Director Gao.

Sensing the collective gaze of the crowd, the team members initially tensed, then straightened their backs and raised their heads proudly.

Someone started clapping, and within moments, the entire banquet hall erupted in applause.

Watching this scene, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "This is getting a bit over the top!"

Spotting True Monarch Magnetic Pole in the crowd, Zhang Yu immediately sent a message: Teacher, are you alright?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied: Let Old Gao have his moment of glory before you leave.

Zhang Yu: I revealed my transfer to the Civil Engineering Department during the Civil Engineering Competition to boost morale!

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: It's fine.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Cloud Haven turned to Director Gao with a smile. "Old Gao, the Civil Engineering Department has flourished under your leadership!"

Director Gao chuckled. "It's all thanks to the guidance of the school leaders and the students' relentless dedication!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven said, "Don't hesitate to come to me with any difficulties in the future!"

Director Gao replied with a smile, "The Civil Engineering Department still needs to strengthen its talent cultivation efforts!"


True Monarch Cloud Haven thought to himself, "Once Zhang Yu transfers departments and Mo Shangjin graduates, the Civil Engineering Department's academic performance will likely plummet. We definitely need to intensify our efforts in cultivating reserve talent!"

Director Gao waved Zhang Yu over and said to True Monarch Cloud Haven, "This young man has contributed significantly this year and shows great promise. Principal, please continue to support him in the future!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven was slightly surprised, thinking, "Zhang Yu is transferring to the Artifact Refinement Department. Why would you ask me to support him? You should focus on supporting your own Civil Engineering Department first!"
