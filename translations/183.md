# Chapter 183: School Power Tyrant, Level 10 Spring and Autumn

Inside Songyang High School.

In the classroom of Grade Two, Class 10.

Although Class 10 had the worst average scores in Songyang High School's second year, the atmosphere of the Immortal Dao within the classroom still far surpassed that of an ordinary high school.

When a stone-faced Bai Zhenzhen opened the classroom door and walked in, she was met with the sight of desks covered in syringes and vials, and the awestruck gazes of the Class 10 students.

In the eyes of these Class 10 students, Bai Zhenzhen—ranked second in the grade and a winner of academic competitions—was a true inner sect prodigy of Songyang High School, someone destined to ascend to the second layer and attend university.

As for their Class 10? It was nothing more than servants' quarter, its students fated to join the workforce right after graduation, one foot already in the factory door.

But to see an inner sect prodigy arrive in their service division now, the students were all shocked.

"It's Bai Zhenzhen! A prodigy from the model class actually came to our garbage dump!"

"That's the female top student who ranks second in the grade! I'd willingly skip class just to copy her exam paper!"

"Is she here to bully us? Don't take my homework!"

As the students' minds raced with varied thoughts, the Class 10 monitor quickly stood up, approached Bai Zhenzhen, and said, "Senior Bai Zhenzhen, how can we help you?"

Although they were all second-year students, on the path of the Immortal Dao, the talented came first. To survive better in Songyang High School, the students of Class 10 had always addressed the top students from other classes as "senior."

Seeing the monitor approach, Bai Zhenzhen pulled a power bank from her pocket and said coldly, "I'm taking over the outlets in your classroom."

"From now on, you will charge this for me every day."

"Once it's full, send it over to me"

Without waiting for his confused and nervous reaction, Bai Zhenzhen turned and left.

She had no fear that these Class 10 students would dare to disobey her command. After all, in the world of high schools, grades were supreme, and underachievers were powerless against academic tyrants. Forget a trivial matter like charging a power bank. If she ordered them to kneel and kowtow, they would have no choice but to obey.

After leaving Class 10, Bai Zhenzhen proceeded to several other classrooms in turn, distributing the power banks she was carrying.

Soon, Bai Zhenzhen arrived on the floor for the first-year students.

Looking at the empty classrooms, Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, _The power banks are just a supplement. To really steal electricity, touching the outlets myself is still faster._

It was still late August, and the first-year students had not yet enrolled. Bai Zhenzhen casually walked into an empty first-year classroom as the power of the detection ritual within her activated, instantly scanning the four surveillance cameras in the room.

However, the four surveillance cameras appeared dim in her vision. Bai Zhenzhen knew this meant that none of them had been activated.

_The first-years aren't here yet, so this classroom is unused._

She confidently approached an outlet, her fair fingertips pressing against its surface.

As faint sparks of electricity flickered at her fingertips, Bai Zhenzhen felt a tingling, crackling current surge into her body.

Replenished by this current, Bai Zhenzhen felt the thunder magic power within her suddenly flare into activity. As her magic power units temporarily surged, the energy began to course through her entire body, strengthening her physique and nervous system while also causing her to emit a faint electric glow.

After charging for a while, Bai Zhenzhen seized the opportunity to cultivate the Thunderclap True Body.

This body tempering cultivation technique worked by condensing thunder-attribute magic power to stimulate and train the physical body.

After reaching level 10 and undergoing deductions from her True Spiritual Root, Bai Zhenzhen's physical resilience had been continuously improving, and in a high-speed state, her body even possessed cushioning and energy-absorbing properties.

Now, infused with the temporarily surging thunder magic power, the process of condensing thunder-attribute magic power was skipped entirely, allowing the Thunderclap True Body to operate more smoothly than ever.

Ever since awakening her potential, Bai Zhenzhen felt that her control over the thunder magic power in her body was effortless, as if it were a natural extension of herself.

Coupled with the outlet right beside her, she could replenish her magic power consumption at any time.

This combination of factors made Bai Zhenzhen's body tempering several times more effective than usual.

Even the True Spiritual Root within her dantian gradually became entwined with faint wisps of electricity.

She continued until her muscles began to grow sore and numb, a sign that her body was approaching overexertion, and only then did she temporarily stop.

_Hmm, time for a break. I should go back and check on the harvest as well._

So, Bai Zhenzhen returned to the model class classroom, where she found her desk piled high with fully charged power banks.

A slight smile touched Bai Zhenzhen's lips at the sight. She immediately grabbed the power banks and dashed out, sucking on the end of a power bank's cable to feel the steady current flow into her while she began a breathing exercise to recover her magic power.

While Bai Zhenzhen was in her classroom collecting the power banks, a student complained to He Dayou, "President, if Bai Zhenzhen keeps monopolizing the outlets like this, how are we supposed to charge our devices?"

He Dayou frowned at the complaint. "Bai Zhenzhen is second in our grade. What's your rank? Letting her use the outlets to charge is only right, isn't it?"

The student protested, "But…"

He Dayou cut him off. "There are no 'buts.' Either you put up with it, or you surpass her grades. If you can do that, you could charge your things in the principal's office and no one would say a word."

Watching the student shuffle away dejectedly, He Dayou shook his head, sighing inwardly that as the vice president of the Student Council, he had a duty to be impartial.

If Zhao Tianxing had been the one hogging the outlets, he would have stepped forward to speak for justice, but since it was Bai Zhenzhen, he could only advise the other students to endure.

Meanwhile, on the school rooftop.

Zhang Yu was cultivating the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen. With each set of movements he completed, the muscles in his body seemed to tear and break down under the tempering, only to be rapidly repaired and healed by the nourishment of his Longevity magic power.

He grew progressively stronger through this cycle of autumn and spring, of death and rebirth, continuously expelling the accumulated medicinal and alchemical toxins from his body.

Finally, upon completing another round of the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened abruptly. His Spring and Autumn Endless Zen had finally reached level 10.

At that moment, the experiences from countless cycles of spring and autumn, of nourishing and purifying his physical body, surged through his mind, bringing his mastery of this cultivation technique to its absolute peak.

The forty-nine forms of the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen flashed through his mind as his Longevity magic power flowed in correspondence throughout his body. The cycle of autumn and spring endlessly strengthened his physique and purified his flesh and blood, seemingly without limit.

It was also at this moment that Zhang Yu discovered that after reaching level 10, the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen's detoxification ability grew even stronger. He could even control the alchemical and medicinal toxins that were meant to be expelled, keeping them stored within his body.

These toxins would form the character for "Zen" on the skin of his chest, and as the toxins accumulated, the character's color would deepen.

Ordinarily, these toxins would not affect him, but when needed, Zhang Yu could make them erupt, violently stimulating his body, squeezing out his life's potential, and unleashing physical strength that surpassed his limits.

_But the stronger the accumulated toxins, the greater the potential unleashed, and the more it consumes one's lifespan._

Zhang Yu contemplated the technique's mysteries, thinking to himself, _This is a move for life-or-death situations. It's best not to use it unless absolutely necessary._

As for when to use such a desperate move?

In Zhang Yu's view, it was certainly not for fighting. Fights were desperate enough, and this move was too costly; it might be more advantageous to simply lose.

The upcoming Foundation Establishment exam, on the other hand, was a matter that concerned his entire future. If sacrificing a few years of his life could increase his chances of success, Zhang Yu found that acceptable.

_Now that the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen is at level 10, I need to find time to gather the basic high school cultivation techniques and complete the High School Sacred Body._

After briefly familiarizing himself with his level 10 Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, the bell rang, and Zhang Yu knew it was time for lunch.

Given the vast amount of time he dedicated to body tempering each day, eating was no less important to Zhang Yu than cultivation itself.

He immediately vaulted off the rooftop.

He landed on the ground with a thud under the gazes of onlookers, then strode quickly toward the cafeteria.

His gaze swept across the line in front of the cafeteria. Seeing the purple people, black people, and beastmen, Zhang Yu had to marvel at the diversity now present at Songyang High School.

The black people in particular gave him a sense of familiarity.

_It feels like I've transmigrated back home._

_I never thought our Kunxu would have its own black people._

Under the awestruck gazes of the crowd, Zhang Yu walked straight past the queue, got his food, and went to his usual table in the cafeteria, where he saw Bai Zhenzhen had already arrived.

Just as Zhang Yu began eating while scrolling through basic high school cultivation techniques on his phone, Zhao Tianxing and Qian Shen arrived with their meals.

However, Zhao Tianxing and Qian Shen looked quite different from a few weeks ago.

Though their skin still had a purplish tint, it was much fainter than that of the other students.

Zhao Tianxing still remembered when only a few people in school, including himself, had first undergone the modification surgery and become purple-skinned. He had felt quite awkward.

But as the number of purple-skinned students grew, he started to feel more natural. Instead, it was those who had not undergone the surgery who began to feel self-conscious and awkward.

And when the vast majority had undergone the surgery, those with the darkest purple skin became the most looked down upon, the most self-conscious, the most awkward.

This was because after completing the super-metabolism surgery, a lighter skin color indicated a stronger mastery of the process.

Zhao Tianxing thought to himself, _Without realizing it, a new standard for class division has emerged among the school's purple-skinned population. From the lowest-tier deep purples, to the mid-tier light purples, and finally to the highest-tier no-purples, the lighter the color, the higher the status._

_And this is in Songyang High School, where not everyone has even had the super-metabolism surgery. I hear that in Purple Cloud High School, where everyone has had it, skin color has been completely integrated into the school's high school caste system..._

Just then, an announcement came over the school's broadcast system. It stated that school discipline would be tightened, with strict checks for tardiness and truancy.

Hearing this, both Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen frowned; they were among the biggest truants at Songyang High School.

After all, the current high school curriculum could no longer keep up with their progress on the Immortal Dao. Attending class meant wasting time, which was simply not an option for the two of them, who urgently needed time to prepare for the Foundation Establishment exam.
