# Chapter 586: Young Friend, Save Me!

In the laboratory, Liu Xiangqiao was working with her three assistants: Zi Yunzhen, Su Yunni, and another.

Although Zhang Yu had completed the refinement of the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation and wasn't currently working on any new military-grade projects, the assistants hadn't left. Instead, they remained to continue working for him.

Since Zhang Yu's recent rise to prominence, he had taken on numerous small jobs involving magical artifact maintenance and repair, all of which were handled by Heavenly Sun Radiance God and his assistants.

Their willingness to stay stemmed from the grand promise Zhang Yu had dangled before them: "In a while, I plan to begin refining the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor."

Upon hearing this plan, Liu Xiangqiao and the others were first startled, then overjoyed.

The Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor was a newly introduced magical artifact in the Artifact Refinement Department — a type of military-grade armor previously unknown to the department. It was exceptionally rare, and no student had yet mastered its refinement.

If they could start refining and studying it ahead of others, they would undoubtedly gain a significant advantage in this field.

With such a head start, they might even have a chance to obtain military-grade certification through refining the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor.

Zhang Yu possessed the strength to drive this initiative forward. His achievements over the past year had thoroughly demonstrated his prowess and potential in artifact refinement to his assistants.

Realizing this, Liu Xiangqiao, Zi Yunzhen, and Su Yunni resolved to stay, eager to participate in Zhang Yu's next military-grade project.

Seeing his assistants' diligent work ethic, Zhang Yu felt deeply satisfied. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "Lady Fortune was right. Being a boss really is about knowing how to paint grand visions."

"A well-painted vision is even more motivating than a raise."

After surveying his employees' progress, Zhang Yu resumed absorbing Calamity Qi to continue cultivating the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon.

This military-grade cultivation technique relied on various forms of Calamity Qi to advance one's cultivation. Fortunately, Zhang Yu now had the financial means to purchase Calamity Qi, eliminating the need to roam the world in search of it. Combined with his unparalleled talent, his cultivation progress had been astonishingly rapid in recent days.

As the absorbed Calamity Qi circulated through his body, transforming into layers of restrictions that settled within his Dantian, Zhang Yu's mind flooded with fleeting images — memories of his diligent training, rigorous practice, and meticulous study of the cultivation art.

Dark Spirit Realm.

Before a massive, ancient round table, the colossal figures of three Evil Gods slowly descended.

Lady Fortune casually seated herself at the table, gazing at the three Evil Gods and asking, "Speak. What's the matter this time?"

Zhang Yu watched the scene with equal curiosity, awaiting the Evil Gods' response.

Since connecting with the other Evil Gods in the Dark Spirit Realm, Zhang Yu and Lady Fortune had been meeting here periodically to exchange information, establishing another channel for gathering intelligence.

At that moment, the Joy God, a being with a thousand hands and a thousand feet, its eyes flashing in unison, slowly spoke, "The Dual Rest Cult's actions have severely impacted all parties involved."

"We can't let them continue their rampage."

Lady Fortune's gaze flickered slightly, and she smiled. "The Dual Rest Cult is indeed a nuisance."

"Their recent chaos has provoked a fierce reaction from the Patrol Team, easily leading to collateral damage that could harm us."

"But if they truly have the backing of the Finance Department, this involves a power struggle within the upper echelons of Myriad Laws University. Would our intervention be wise?"

Meanwhile, the Auspicious God, a being composed of swirling, multicolored light, declared, "The Dual Rest Cult violates the interests of everyone. Everyone must strike them down."

"Even within the Finance Department, not everyone supports the Dual Rest Cult."

"It's likely just one high-ranking individual exploiting the cult's influence for personal gain."

"Eliminating that person should resolve the issue."

Lady Fortune asked, "Oh? It seems you know who this person is?"

Joy God replied, "We can't confirm it yet, but they made a critical mistake recently."

Joy God extended his palm, and an image of Zhang Yu materialized within it.

Lady Fortune's gaze flickered, but she remained silent, listening intently as Joy God recounted the events surrounding Zhang Yu.

Joy God concluded, "...From what we can tell, the Finance Department is collaborating with the Dual Rest Cult to set a trap for Zhang Yu."

Lady Fortune asked curiously, "Why would they target Zhang Yu?"

Joy God explained, "Zhang Yu is True Monarch Magnetic Pole's breakthrough in Soul Transformation Bionics. Moreover, the project achieved a new breakthrough shortly before the trap was set."

"They likely want to control and exploit Zhang Yu to extract more information about Soul Transformation Bionics."

"After Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's exposure last time, many Bionics leaked out and fell into the hands of various factions. The Finance Department at Myriad Laws University likely possesses one as well."

Zhang Yu's heart jolted at this revelation, and he meticulously recorded the information.

Lady Fortune asked, "Oh? So their goal aligns with yours?"

Joy God nodded. "Similar, yet not entirely the same. Our objective is to use Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Soul Transformation Bionic to locate the account book, find the Mighty Reincarnations, and control them. The Finance Department's goal, as far as we know, may also be to find the Mighty Reincarnations, but not to control them. It's more likely they intend to eliminate them."

Lady Fortune asked, "Eliminate them?"

Joy God raised all his thousand hands, pointing upward. "Those above also seek the Mighty Reincarnations, but their motive is to block this loophole in the Five Taxes of Heavenly Beings. They want to crush the reincarnated beings completely, preventing them from ever entering the sect again."

Zhang Yu's heart stirred. "Doesn't this drag us back into the sect's internal power struggles?"

He couldn't help but sigh. Kunxu truly was a place of constant conflict, with battles raging from top to bottom and bottom to top. Everywhere he looked, there was competition and strife.

The Joy God seemed reluctant to reveal too much about this matter. After a brief explanation, he continued, "In short, their plot against Zhang Yu has failed."

"And in doing so, they left a weakness."

The Joy God gently opened his other palm, revealing the figure of True Person Rising Sun.

The Joy God declared, "This Golden Core cultivator was used against Zhang Yu. He must possess clues related to the Finance Department."

The Auspicious God coldly added, "Find him, extract the clues from him, and expose them to Myriad Laws University. Then, we can sit back and watch the internal strife unfold."

Observing the Evil Gods' discussion, Lady Fortune suddenly remarked, "Our actions are too obvious. The Righteous Gods will see through it easily, and we'll be implicated."

The Auspicious God retorted, "Is this the time for such concerns? If we let the Dual Rest Cult and the Finance Department continue their rampage, not only will our lives become unbearable, but they might even seize the list of Mighty Reincarnations before we do."

Lady Fortune smiled faintly. "I'm not suggesting we abandon our plans, merely that we consider alternative methods."

"If we make True Person Rising Sun believe the Finance Department wants to silence him, wouldn't that drive him to betray them and ignite the conflict within Myriad Laws University? Wouldn't the university's higher-ups then target the Finance Department?"

"Alternatively, it might force the Finance Department to protect him, or even try to silence him themselves. Either way, it would make it easier to expose his connection to the Finance Department."

Hearing Lady Fortune's words, Joy God nodded slightly. "That's indeed a promising approach."

Zhang Yu, currently merged with Lady Fortune in the Dark Spirit Realm, listened to her discussion with the three Evil Gods. He thought to himself, "The power struggles above will inevitably ripple down, affecting me, and ultimately affecting True Person Rising Sun."

"But conversely, my conflict with True Person Rising Sun could also influence the higher-ups."

After concluding their communication with the Evil Gods, Zhang Yu and Lady Fortune refrained from further direct involvement, avoiding personal engagement on the true front lines of the conflict.

They acted like someone giving a gentle push from behind, then quietly awaiting the outcome.

Upon exiting the Dark Spirit Realm, Zhang Yu immediately resumed his cultivation art practice, as if everything he had just experienced there had been nothing more than a dream.

For True Person Rising Sun, the recent period had felt like a nightmare.

Since arriving at the Vocational College, his income had plummeted, forcing him to take on multiple part-time jobs just to repay his past loans.

If not for his unwavering hope for the future, his dao heart might have faltered.

After coming to the Vocational College, no one contacted him anymore, gradually fostering a sense of being abandoned by the world.

Soon, he discovered that someone seemed to be secretly monitoring him.

Just as True Person Rising Sun attempted to trace the surveillance, he was targeted in his first assassination attempt...

Late June

Laboratory

Zhang Yu, who was cultivating, noticed a faint flicker in his Bionic Eye. True Person Rising Sun's friend request had popped up.

True Person Rising Sun: I need to discuss something with you.

After waiting several hours without a response, True Person Rising Sun sent another friend request.

True Person Rising Sun: Young friend, this is urgent.

True Person Rising Sun: A matter of life and death!

True Person Rising Sun: Hurry! Add me as a friend!

True Person Rising Sun: Add me, and I'll transfer Spirit Coins.

You have accepted True Person Rising Sun's friend request.

True Person Rising Sun: I wish to request an audience with True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Zhang Yu: Hmm?

True Person Rising Sun: [1 Spirit Coin]

True Person Rising Sun: Please, young friend, introduce me to True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Half an hour later

True Person Rising Sun: Young friend?

True Person Rising Sun initiated a communication request.

Zhang Yu: Wait until I finish what I'm working on.

An hour later

True Person Rising Sun: [1 Spirit Coin]

True Person Rising Sun initiated another communication request.

As True Person Rising Sun's projection materialized before Zhang Yu, he immediately knelt, shouting, "Please, young friend, save me!"

Zhang Yu quickly replied, "Ah, True Person, there's no need for such formality."

True Person Rising Sun hastily explained, "Young friend, the last time I investigated you, it was because a villain was stirring up trouble behind the scenes, deliberately framing you. They made us heroes investigate heroes!"

Seeing True Person Rising Sun get straight to the point, Zhang Yu's lips curled into a slight smile. "This is getting interesting."

Zhang Yu asked, "Who exactly is this person behind the scenes? How could they be so malicious?"
