# Chapter 603: Advertising Value Rankings

"Kuang Tianqing actually lost?"

"Which eye of yours saw her lose? She merely executed a strategic retreat."

"Isn't that just running away?"

"She severely injured Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu before escaping unscathed from a six-person encirclement! No one could stop her."

"So she still ran away? With eight Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs tutoring her, shouldn't she have annihilated the opposition? Honestly, I'd rather have them tutor me..."

Kuang Tianqing's first move in the team competition had clearly captured the attention of countless viewers.

The outcome of this battle sparked endless debate within the Spirit Realm, with opinions ranging from harsh criticism to fervent praise.

Zhang Yu's final taunts further convinced many viewers that Kuang Tianqing had indeed lost the fight.

Scanning the countless comments in the Spirit Realm, sensing the subtle shifts in public opinion, and observing the impact on stock prices, cryptocurrency values, and advertising metrics, Divine Monarch Unrestrained, Principal of Heavenly Demon University, let out a cold snort.

Above the arena, within the Spirit Realm's observation chamber, his voice echoed from within the divine light representing him.

"The students of Myriad Laws University are weak and boastful, but they've certainly mastered the art of twisting truth and falsehood."

Hearing Divine Monarch Unrestrained's words, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution of Myriad Laws University chuckled and said, "Old ghost, don't tell me your discerning eyes can't see Zhang Yu's crucial role in this battle."

"Though his individual strength doesn't match Kuang Tianqing's, like her, he was a key strategist who dictated the rhythm of the battle."

"Whether it was detecting the flaws in the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique, assisting Bai Zhenzhen's sword technique breakthrough, coordinating reinforcements, or executing the final counter-ambush, Zhang Yu was virtually the only one who could rival Kuang Tianqing for control of the battlefield's tempo."

"This was a victory of the weak over the strong, achieved through meticulous resource management, leveraging the environment, and exploiting the rules."

As Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution finished speaking, Divine Monarch Unrestrained scoffed, "Any student with greater individual strength would have done far better."

"Without Wen Wuya's long-range support, Bai Zhenzhen's presence, and Jin Napan's timely arrival... what right did Zhang Yu have to contend with Kuang Tianqing at all?"

"This Zhang Yu was the weakest link and the greatest vulnerability in the battle, precisely why he became the pivotal point for controlling the battle's tempo."

"A victory of the weak over the strong? What's so praiseworthy about such foolishness?"

As the two Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs communicated, the vast armies of Soul Cultivators representing their power erupted within the Spirit Realm under their mental control.

"Kuang Tianqing exposed her daoist arts intel, her failed ambush resulted in damage to her military-grade Bionic, potentially costing Heavenly Demon University the Ten Greats League championship! Heavenly Demon University: LOSS!"

"Kuang Tianqing's debut in the Ten Greats League stunned the world! Her daoist arts complement each other perfectly, forming a self-contained system. She moved freely amidst a multi-school siege, severely injuring two students! Currently the strongest contender, her championship prospects are clear! Heavenly Demon University: WIN!"

Instantly, countless comments and information about Kuang Tianqing flooded the Spirit Realm, pouring the Divine Monarchs' will into the virtual world, shaping public opinion and guiding the thoughts of countless people.

Due to Kuang Tianqing's high profile, the prices of related advertisements, traffic value, and even the stock prices of Heavenly Demon University behind her fluctuated wildly.

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution was already communicating with True Monarch Tranquility, the coach of the school team.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: This Zhang Yu has immense potential.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: Why has he received so little investment?

True Monarch Tranquility hastily replied: He only recently mastered his fourth military-grade power. His experience and seniority are still too limited.

True Monarch Tranquility: We primarily view him as a support role.

True Monarch Tranquility vaguely explained that he had already assessed Zhang Yu and provided the maximum loan amount possible.

After all, there could only be one champion in the Ten Greats League. Dao Qiankun was the primary contender for the Immortal Sect Technique, making him the obvious investment target.

In True Monarch Tranquility's view, even the substantial investments in Dao Qiankun's teammates, Nine Heavens Liu and Yan Qianji, were strategic moves to maximize their overall chances of victory and increase Myriad Laws University's likelihood of winning the championship.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: Tranquility, sometimes we need to tailor our teaching methods to each student's strengths and circumstances. We can't be bound by rigid rules and old ways.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: Zhang Yu shows potential. He can weaken Kuang Tianqing and improve Dao Qiankun's chances of victory.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: After this match, consider increasing his investment.

True Monarch Tranquility: Understood.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: I don't see any advertising space on him yet?

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: After this match, companies will likely want to invest, right?

True Monarch Tranquility: I'll have someone contact them.

After ending the call with Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution, True Monarch Tranquility reviewed the advertising bids from various companies.

These bids represented the amounts companies were willing to pay to place advertisements on Zhang Yu if he participated in the next match.

As the competition progressed and the students' performances varied, the advertising companies' subsequent collaboration offers continued to fluctuate.

True Monarch Tranquility mused inwardly, "If a student's advertising value is high enough, they might secure a spot in the next round, even if their actual combat prowess falls short. Though, of course, it's rare for a student lacking true strength to command such high advertising bids."

After consolidating the highest offers from various sources and assessing public sentiment, a ranked list of advertising bids from companies for each student's next match appeared before True Monarch Tranquility.

First place: Dao Qiankun of Myriad Laws University, advertising bid of 820 Spirit Coins per match.

Second place: Kuang Tianqing of Heavenly Demon University, advertising bid of 710 Spirit Coins per match.

Third place: Yan Xiang of Netherworld University, advertising bid of 600 Spirit Coins per match.

Examining the names and bids of the top three students, True Monarch Tranquility thought, "Kuang Tianqing's highest advertising value has plummeted significantly due to the impact of this battle, dropping from first to second place."

His gaze then drifted downward, noting Wen Wuya in fourth place at 550 Spirit Coins per match, and Bai Zhenzhen in tenth place at 380 Spirit Coins per match.

True Monarch Tranquility thought to himself, "Bai Zhenzhen's demonstrated combat prowess has attracted considerable attention, and the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao itself is generating intense discussion. Her advertising rates have skyrocketed to 10th place almost overnight."

"Wen Wuya's recent long-range support has also rendered him virtually invincible, especially with his attacks now capable of covering the entire arena. This means he can intervene in any battle, making him an exceptionally cost-effective advertising investment."

He couldn't help but marvel, "Who would have thought that after just one battle, two students from Heavenly Sword University would break into the top ten in advertising bids?"

True Monarch Tranquility's gaze continued scanning downward until he finally spotted Zhang Yu at 38th place.

"38th place: Zhang Yu. Next match's advertising rate: 66 Spirit Coins."

True Monarch Tranquility sighed, "Advertising is all about the 'winner takes all' effect. The further down the rankings you go, the more the prices plummet."

He recalled Zhang Yu's performance and thought to himself, "Without sufficient practical combat experience and a firsthand understanding of the battlefield's nuances, ordinary viewers wouldn't grasp Zhang Yu's crucial role in this battle."

"And if ordinary viewers don't see it, advertisers won't be interested."

"Although Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing clashed over the battlefield's momentum, from the perspectives of viewer appeal and advertising impact, he was overshadowed by Jin Napan, who made his appearance at the very end."

To be honest, True Monarch Tranquility was already surprised that Zhang Yu's advertising valuation had climbed to 38th place.

"The main reason for this surge likely isn't Zhang Yu's performance itself, but rather his piggybacking on Kuang Tianqing's massive popularity."

True Monarch Tranquility thought to himself, "Especially that final shout, which must have boosted his ranking by at least several dozen spots."

In True Monarch Tranquility's view, Zhang Yu's final declaration had a far greater impact on public opinion and his advertising valuation than his combat performance itself — even more so than his desperate fighting.

Myriad Laws University.

In the laboratory, True Monarch Magnetic Pole unconsciously paused her experiment.

Images of Zhang Yu's battle against Kuang Tianqing and Bai Zhenzhen flashed through her mind. She mused inwardly, "This boy's performance has truly exceeded all expectations."

"Though luck certainly played a part..."

"But..."

An idea sparked in her mind: "After the first team competition, should I increase my investment in him?"

While Zhang Yu had shown considerable strength and remarkable design talent, True Monarch Magnetic Pole had initially considered it too early for him to achieve significant results in the Ten Greats League.

"I initially thought investing in his participation in the Ten Greats League would be a poor investment."

"Now, it seems he's performing better than I anticipated."

With a thought, True Monarch Magnetic Pole instructed her artifact spirits to record all of Zhang Yu's live broadcast footage and flag key segments for her review.

As True Monarch Magnetic Pole pondered whether to increase her investment in Zhang Yu after the first team match, True Person Starfire watched Zhang Yu's battle from a remote corner of the Spirit Realm and sighed, "Zhang Yu's combat skills remain sharp. His battle taunts and awareness of ambushes are as formidable as ever."

"Forcing Kuang Tianqing to retreat — he performed nearly flawlessly in this fight."

"It seems he hasn't become blindly obsessed with making money during his university years. The fire of battle still burns in his heart."

True Person Starfire knew that while the Ten Greats League's rules appeared fair, the very structure of the competition inherently favored certain competitors.

"How many university students regularly practice life-or-death combat? How many still harbor such fighting spirit?"

True Person Starfire lamented, "Only the top academic overachievers from each university can afford to research true death battles while also pursuing wealth."

"But the poor, accustomed to earning money and creating value through Immortal Dao profits... they've long lost their taste for real combat, their fighting spirit extinguished. If they were to step into this arena, they'd struggle to adapt to the ruthless rhythm of battle."

"Zhang Yu still retains the will to fight to the death. That's excellent."

Meanwhile, on the battlefield, Zhang Yu watched Kuang Tianqing's retreating figure vanish into the distance. He thought to himself, "The things I shouted during the livestream should have significantly weakened her Immortal Dao Potential. Plus, I might even get a bit of her viewership."

As for Kuang Tianqing's final threat, Zhang Yu didn't take it seriously at all.

Not because he believed her threat was empty, but because Zhang Yu understood that Kuang Tianqing had already set her sights on him and Bai Zhenzhen long ago.

They were already absolute enemies. Whether he shouted or remained silent, Kuang Tianqing would still try to eliminate them. In Zhang Yu's view, shouting a few words to boost his own popularity and weaken his opponent was the better option.
