# Chapter 687: Arrival of a True Monarch

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus spoke coldly, "Magnetic Pole! For the sake of all living beings, we can no longer tolerate your recklessness."

Magnetic Pole glared coldly at this figure from Heavenly Demon University, a renowned elder in the Artifact Refining World, a former Soul Transformation disciple, a judge in numerous artifact refinement competitions, the past vice-principal of Heavenly Demon University, and now its current principal...

With a low growl, Magnetic Pole summoned the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda behind her, suppressing the surrounding Spirit Realm and sealing off any external communication.

"Sinful Lotus! You dare speak of all living beings to me?"

"The Demonic Sect and Evil Gods are advancing relentlessly. It was I who devised the defense lines, positioned Divine Monarch Greenwood at the forefront, and constructed the defensive formations that held them back. Yet you spend your days squabbling over spoils and seizing war profits. When have you ever considered Kunxu? When have you ever thought of all living beings?"

"I exhausted my resources to repair the World-Piercing Cone, to break through the Spatial Lockdown. Yet you stir up trouble right under my nose, sending spies to investigate me, publishing slanderous articles, and dispatching agents to undermine my subordinates. In the end... it's all about seizing my World-Piercing Cone."

As she spoke, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God materialized behind Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, radiating scorching light. Its eyes, imbued with the Glazed Pure Flame of an Immortal Sect Technique, swept across the assembled Soul Transformation cultivators.

"But we're facing a formidable enemy!"

"What are you still arguing about?" Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole snapped. "Do you want to destroy levels two through five of Kunxu? Bankrupt all Ten Great Universities? When the Heavenly Court returns, I'll be stripped of my position, my assets seized, and buried under astronomical debts — only then will you be satisfied?"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus met her gaze unflinchingly. Behind him, the Heavenly Demon Banner suddenly expanded and billowed, countless Yin Souls shrieking within it. The banner's unleashed power rivaled the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda, each claiming half of the Spirit Realm in the area.

"Magnetic Pole! Stop stalling!" Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus roared. "It's been five months! Our Ten Great Universities have been trapped here for five months, burning through money for five months... This time, you must hand over the artifact and give us an explanation."

"Otherwise, we'll convene the Soul Transformation Assembly and vote for a new plan. Whether it's our Cold Storage Plan or the Immortal Armaments' Fortress Plan, anything is better than your current stalemate!"

As Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus spoke, the Soul Transformations from Netherworld, White Bone, and Joyous Union Universities voiced their agreement.

"Magnetic Pole, it's not that we don't want to support you, but so much time has passed without results. It's natural for doubts to arise, and we can't justify this to our universities."

"Magnetic Pole, if you're facing research challenges, share them with us. Sinful Lotus is a master of artifact refinement; his help would be far better than you working in isolation."

"I think Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus should be in charge of the World-Piercing Cone project. His artifact refinement skills far surpass Magnetic Pole's, and he's promised to open-source all his spatial technology research."

Divine Monarch Great Devourer of Celestial Monsters University chuckled. "Magnetic Pole, if you don't trust them, send the World-Piercing Cone to me. I'll conduct a thorough evaluation under Celestial Monsters University's guarantee of impartiality and objectivity."

Simultaneously, the Soul Transformation avatars of Vajra, Immortal Soldiers, and Heavenly Sword sent messages to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

"Magnetic Pole, it's not that we don't support you, but you need to show some tangible results."

"Magnetic Pole, release the World-Piercing Cone's design blueprint and silence your critics. I guarantee Immortal Armaments University won't plagiarize your magical artifact, even if we get the blueprint."

At that moment, the Soul Transformation avatar of Pill Cauldron University coughed. "Everyone, with a great enemy looming, let's not damage our unity..."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus glared coldly at Magnetic Pole. "Magnetic Pole, what's your plan?"

As the gazes of the Soul Transformation avatars converged on her, each gaze felt like a mountain pressing down, an overwhelming weight crushing Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Within University City at Myriad Laws University.

Le Mulan sprinted forward, clutching a bag of potions as she chased after Zhang Yu's Flying Boat.

She didn't know what Zhang Yu was going to do at the front lines, nor how she could help him. She only wanted to give him the potions she had saved up before he left.

Looking at the potions Le Mulan had brought, Zhang Yu knew that most of them would be of little use to him now that he had broken through to the Nascent Soul Realm.

Lady Fortune scoffed impatiently, "Too weak! What's the difference between this and a cat or dog bringing their favorite treat? Hmph, Le Mulan has outlived her usefulness. Why bother with her? Zhang Yu, on the Immortal Dao, you must learn to network upward. Friends who can't keep up aren't our friends."

Zhang Yu ignored Lady Fortune, smiled gently at Le Mulan, and accepted the potions. Then, he placed a palm on her shoulder, transferring a surge of Magic Power into her.

"Mulan, wait for me to return. I'll help you advance your cultivation."

Zhang Yu knew that Le Mulan's Dao Seed, the Profound Cold Meridian, required 5,000 units of Magic Power and 250% Magic Power Quality to upgrade.

Given her current Golden Core cultivation, she was already close to meeting these requirements.

"A 3rd-tier Profound Cold Meridian... I should now be capable of protecting it."

Zhang Yu boarded the Flying Boat. With a thunderous roar, the vessel shot skyward, hurtling toward the Grand Void between the Second and Third Layers.

Zhang Yu wasted no time. Having recently broken through to the Nascent Soul Realm, he knew he had much to cultivate, improve, and refine.

After reaching Level 40 with Kunlun in the Palm, Zhang Yu chose to focus on his mental cultivation technique.

Seated cross-legged in the Flying Boat's Meditation Chamber, his consciousness plunged into the Spirit Realm, arriving in the Great Purity Realm.

Zhang Yu intended to use the Supreme Clarity Realm's accelerated time flow to cultivate his second mental cultivation technique, the Immeasurable Heart Inner Dharma Body.

This black art enhanced mental processing speed, allowing for multitasking and multiple streams of thought.

At Level 10, it enabled dual-tasking; at Level 20, Fourfold Thinking. By the time Zhang Yu reached Level 30 during his Golden Core Stage, he had already achieved Eightfold Thinking.

Unlike physical cultivation techniques like the Remnant Ox's Self-Sacrifice Heart Sutra, the Immeasurable Heart Inner Dharma Body was a purely spiritual technique, making it ideal for accelerated cultivation within the Supreme Clarity Realm. Zhang Yu had verified this during both his Foundation Establishment and Golden Core Stages.

With each cycle of his mental cultivation technique, Zhang Yu's mastery rapidly advanced, surging from Level 30 to 31, then 32, and beyond.

By the time he neared the Grand Void, he had pushed the cultivation art to Level 35 in a single breath.

The Eight-Headed White Ox in his mind roared incessantly, as if yearning to split again and transform into its sixteen-headed form.

Zhang Yu recalled how, even during his Foundation Establishment Stage, he could control dozens of Gang Qi Clones simultaneously.

With his enhanced mental processing power and the sixteenfold thinking granted by the Level 40 mental cultivation technique, he could manipulate vast numbers of magical artifacts alone, making him a one-man army.

If he could coordinate with a large group of Soul Cultivators, their combined destructive and creative potential would skyrocket exponentially.

Emerging from the Supreme Clarity Realm, Zhang Yu opened his eyes and glanced at the notification flashing in his Bionic Eye. "Almost there?" he murmured to himself.

At that moment, his gaze shifted, and a figure materialized before him.

It resembled Zhang Yu himself, yet its entire form seemed to be composed of swirling mist, with layers of turbulent energy surging around it.

With a thought, Zhang Yu commanded the mist behind the figure to surge, revealing hundreds upon thousands of arms formed from swirling clouds.

But in the next moment, as Zhang Yu's thoughts shifted, the arms vanished into the swirling mist.

This figure was Zhang Yu's Nascent Soul. In addition to perfectly inheriting the strength of his physical body, it could instantly manifest hundreds or even thousands of limbs to unleash its power and execute all the martial arts Zhang Yu had mastered.

Particularly potent was the Immortal Sect Martial Art, Kunlun in the Palm. Enhanced by the ten Extraordinary Meridians within the Nascent Soul and amplified by the Nascent Soul's ability to manipulate Primordial Qi, its Kunlun-controlling power was further amplified.

More importantly, Zhang Yu sensed that his Nascent Soul, as an extension of his physical body, could also wield the authority of an Immortal Descendant, opening spatial portals through its form.

"With this, my Nascent Soul can now execute the combined power of Kunlun in the Palm and the Immortal Descendant's authority."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's physical body had undergone a profound transformation. Every strand of flesh and blood had completely fused with Magic Power, and his thirteen layers of Dao Foundation had coalesced into a unique Physical Expression Factor, ultimately manifesting as a rare Physical Divine Ability.

According to Zhang Yu's post-breakthrough data analysis, this Physical Divine Ability was not only exceedingly rare but also typically manifested only among monsterfolk.

The Physical Divine Ability, known as the Formless Freedom Body, granted its user immense resistance to similar attacks within a short period. Legend held that a cultivator possessing this ability could only be severely wounded by the same technique once in a single battle.

As Zhang Yu acclimated to his newfound power after breaking through to the Nascent Soul Realm, another notification appeared before him: an upgrade to his treatment, including an upgraded laboratory and dormitory, increased funding, internet access, and resource provisions — a comprehensive upgrade.

Zhang Yu mused inwardly, "This must be Teacher Magnetic Pole pushing for my improved treatment."

Furthermore, under the wartime emergency policies, all Expert-Grade Techniques across the academy were now freely accessible to him. All military-grade cultivation techniques from the Artifact Refinement Department, along with design blueprints for Bionics and magical artifacts, could be purchased for just 10 Spirit Coins each.

Gazing at these benefits, Zhang Yu couldn't help but recall the immense effort and time he had once invested to acquire a single military-grade cultivation technique.

"Indeed... chaos is a ladder."

"In peacetime, obtaining all the military-grade knowledge of the Artifact Refinement Department would have been impossible."

Just as Zhang Yu was pondering these matters, his scholarship loan was disbursed.

---

Although Zhang Yu didn't take the graduate student final exams, he still received excellent grades and secured a scholarship loan.

During his seclusion, while Magnetic Pole and Greenwood covered all his cultivation expenses, Zhang Yu's bank account continued to receive occasional transfers.

Staring at the cold 2,000 Spirit Coins in his account, Zhang Yu felt it still wouldn't be enough.

"After all, all my magical artifacts are only Level 20 right now. They're all waiting to be upgraded to Level 40."

Zhang Yu knew that even this single upgrade would exhaust his funds, prompting him to sigh, "As cultivation advances, while one earns more, one spends even more."

"Money... it's never enough."

"That's why I need to leverage the current situation to secure even more resources."

At the bottom of the notice was information about applying for a Daoist title.

Divine Monarch Greenwood: You've already reached the Nascent Soul Realm! Hurry up and apply for a Daoist title!

Divine Monarch Greenwood: How can a Nascent Soul cultivator not have a Daoist title? It's utterly absurd!

Zhang Yu logged into the Spirit Realm and navigated to the Daoist title application interface.

He thought to himself, "True, without a Daoist title, how will others know I've reached the Nascent Soul Realm? And how will they address me as True Monarch?"

Zhang Yu entered the Daoist name he had chosen: True Monarch Morality.

"The Daoist name you requested is already taken. Would you like to rename it? Suggested alternatives: True Monarch Plunder, True Monarch Virtue Guide, True Monarch Inverse-Gain..."

Watching this unfold, Zhang Yu couldn't help but mutter inwardly, "Damn it... Someone already took Morality? How can you claim such a grand title if you can't even handle it?"

Resigned, Zhang Yu submitted another Daoist name.

True Monarch Myriad Laws, True Monarch Heaven-Reaching, True Monarch Heavenly Mandate, True Monarch Kunlun, True Monarch Extreme Tiger, True Monarch Local... Each name Zhang Yu submitted was repeatedly rejected as already taken.

"Damn it... Even Extreme Tiger is already taken?" Zhang Yu thought. "Two-character Daoist names are too easily duplicated. When will the Heavenly Court allow three- or four-character names?"

"Maybe soon," Lady Fortune said. "With so many Golden Core Certificates and Nascent Soul Certificates issued recently, perhaps the Heavenly Court will open up longer Daoist names when they descend. Then you can just pay to add more characters."

After a moment's thought, Zhang Yu finally entered a Daoist name that wasn't already taken.

"True Monarch Blazing Light?" Lady Fortune murmured, her gaze fixed on the Daoist title. "He even added the character '羽' (Yu, feather) specifically?"

"Hmm, both fiery and radiant," she mused inwardly. "Is he aiming to shine brightly and become renowned throughout the world? But the character '烛' (candle, light) also evokes the image of light emerging from darkness, somewhat reminiscent of the Immortal Sect Technique this young man practices."

After completing the Daoist title application, Zhang Yu took a screenshot and casually posted it on his social media feed.

"Perfect timing... it's time to announce my return."

As soon as Zhang Yu's post went live, the likes and comments began flooding in. Friends, classmates, fellow villagers, and subordinates all sent their congratulations.

Zhao Tianxing: Congratulations, True Monarch Blazing Light, on your emergence from seclusion! 🎉🎉🎉

Ying Xin: True Monarch! I've been burning with impatience, longing for your guidance these past five months!

Ye Xingli: True Monarch, I'm so glad you're back. I'll return the company to you in a few days.

As Zhang Yu read through these messages, he sighed inwardly. "I never imagined that after becoming a Nascent Soul True Monarch, these titles... would make me feel more distant and estranged than ever before."

Zhang Yu replied to Ye Xingli: Senior Sister, you'll always be my senior sister. Just call me Junior Brother — there's no need to address me as True Monarch.

He then sent messages to Zhao Tianxing, Ying Xin, and others, instructing them to use their usual terms of address.

Shi Huaiyu immediately grew excited upon seeing Zhang Yu's post: Zhang Yu has emerged from seclusion! Does this mean good news is coming?

Feng Tingting's heart jolted as she read Zhang Yu's post: Zhang Yu has broken through to the Nascent Soul Realm? Did he achieve this while we were talking earlier? Was I too dismissive? How should I apologize to a True Monarch?

Kuang Tianqing's gaze sharpened: He reached the Nascent Soul Realm in just over a year?

This development further solidified Kuang Tianqing's suspicions: The more I observe Zhang Yu, the more he seems like an Immortal reincarnation, or at least someone with an Immortal's memories. I must test him again...

Kuang Tianqing's method of testing was simple: offering themself as his bedmate.

After more than a year of adaptation, Kuang Tianqing had come to understand a fundamental truth: their body, having been cultivated by eight Soul Transformation Realm masters, possessed an irresistible allure to cultivators in this world.

If Zhang Yu lacks Immortal memories, he'll undoubtedly desire to cultivate with me.

"If he's not interested in me, and considering his past behavior... then he might truly be a reincarnated Immortal."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu smiled as he replied to the messages flooding his communication device.

Just then, the Flying Boat lurched to a halt.

"Are we there yet?"

Zhang Yu made his way to the upper deck of the Flying Boat, where the Grand Void between Kunxu's Second and Third Layers stretched before him.

This was only his second visit here since joining Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's campaign.

The sight was awe-inspiring: a massive tear in the fabric of reality, a gaping hole piercing both the sky of the Second Layer and the earth of the Third Layer.

Surrounding this colossal void, across the Third Layer's terrain, a network of strongholds, fortresses, and bastions had been erected, rising and falling like waves.

At that moment, countless Flying Boats formed long queues, preparing to pass through the Grand Void, shuttling between the Second and Third Layers.

Nearly every vessel was subject to inspection, toll collection, tax assessment, and other bureaucratic procedures.

Gazing at the endless line, Zhang Yu frowned slightly. "How long will this take?"

Just then, Divine Monarch Greenwood asked Zhang Yu about his location. After hearing Zhang Yu's reply, he smiled slightly and said, "Proceed directly."

"You're no longer at the Golden Core stage. Nascent Soul True Monarchs can pass freely."

Zhang Yu's eyes lit up, and he immediately ordered his crew to maneuver the Flying Boat out of the crowd and directly toward the Grand Void.

As soon as his Flying Boat moved, another vessel intercepted, blocking his path.

Mu Qiansi emerged from the intercepting Flying Boat, her Bionic Eye displaying information about the vessel and its passengers. "Myriad Laws' Flying Boat... Hmm? Zhang Yu?" she thought to herself.

As a Heavenly Chosen from Joyful Union University, Mu Qiansi had competed in the Ten Greats League alongside Zhang Yu and even faced him once in battle.

Despite Zhang Yu's ultimate victory, Mu Qiansi's competitive spirit had never waned.

Especially after the great upheaval and her own breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm, her fighting spirit burned even brighter.

"Though I was inferior to Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing in the Foundation Establishment Stage, now that I've reached the Golden Core Realm in this chaotic era, I might yet surpass them."

She even thought that since Zhang Yu would need to spend a great deal of time cultivating and comprehending the Immortal Sect Technique, she might actually reach the Nascent Soul Realm before him.

Of course, while Mu Qiansi harbored a competitive spirit and a desire to challenge Zhang Yu, she wouldn't actively provoke or fight him unless absolutely necessary. She wouldn't waste resources on unnecessary conflicts.

However, the Soul Transformation experts from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools had been targeting Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole at every turn, and this animosity had spread to the students and faculty, who now targeted Myriad Laws University at every opportunity.

Today, as Mu Qiansi guarded the checkpoint, she noticed a Myriad Laws Flying Boat suddenly break formation and immediately moved to intercept it.

When she discovered that Zhang Yu was the sole passenger, she couldn't help but be slightly surprised. She thought to herself, "I heard Zhang Yu had disappeared for months. Why has he suddenly reappeared here? Is Myriad Laws planning something?"

With this thought, Mu Qiansi decided to seize the opportunity to extract information from him. Perhaps she could gain an advantage for Joyful Union University in the ongoing conflict between the Soul Transformation experts of the two factions.

Her gaze icy, Mu Qiansi stepped forward and said to Zhang Yu, "Student, please cooperate with our inspection."

Zhang Yu glanced at Mu Qiansi and smiled faintly. "As far as I know, cultivators of your rank aren't qualified to tell me to 'submit to inspection.'"

With that, Zhang Yu made no attempt to conceal his Daoist title, "True Monarch Blazing Light," which appeared above his head.

Mu Qiansi's breath caught in her throat as she gazed at the four characters. Each character seemed to weigh a thousand pounds, radiating a blinding light that stung her eyes.

"Nascent Soul?!"

"Zhang Yu has broken through to the Nascent Soul Realm?"

"So fast? How could he have advanced so quickly?!"

Staggering backward several steps from the Nascent Soul's blinding radiance, Mu Qiansi finally composed herself and bowed deeply. "I was unaware of True Monarch's presence. Please forgive my offense, True Monarch Zhang."

Zhang Yu nodded curtly and remained silent.

In the next moment, the Flying Boat, bearing the title "True Monarch Blazing Light," passed unimpeded through the Grand Void, leaving behind a crowd snapping photos and screenshots, and a crestfallen Mu Qiansi.

"Another Nascent Soul True Monarch bullying the weak!"

"Fucking hell, they dare inspect a Nascent Soul's Flying Boat? They're blind as bats."

"Nascent Souls should be able to humiliate Golden Cores. Why didn't True Monarch Blazing Light put that Golden Core in his place before leaving?"

Clearly, onlookers believed Nascent Souls deserved special privileges: skipping queues, humiliating Golden Cores, and generally acting superior.

After Zhang Yu arrived at a fortress within the Grand Void, Divine Monarch Greenwood materialized before him.

Seeing the Divine Monarch's hurried arrival and the dark cloud between his brows, Zhang Yu felt a sense of urgency.

"Teacher..."

Divine Monarch Greenwood waved him off, grabbing Zhang Yu's arm and pulling him along. "No time for explanations. We need to act immediately."

He privately messaged Zhang Yu: "Let's get straight to the point. Since you broke through to the Nascent Soul Realm, has your ability to bypass Spatial Lockdowns improved?"

Zhang Yu nodded in response: "Significantly."

Divine Monarch Greenwood: "Good. Can you manifest this ability through your Nascent Soul?"

Zhang Yu: "Yes."

During this exchange, Divine Monarch Greenwood had already led Zhang Yu to a secret chamber. Pointing to the drill-like device before them, he said, "Zhang Yu, if you trust me, place your Nascent Soul inside this. Follow my instructions precisely."
