# Chapter 553: True Monarch Magnetic Pole's Son?

Faced with Su Yunni's question, Zi Yunzhen casually replied, "There's nothing for me to do in the laboratory right now, so the Boss sent me to work on the construction site."

Su Yunni chuckled. "The laboratory is always so busy. How could there be nothing to do? Wait, has Zhang Yu stopped refining the prototype machine?"

As she spoke, Su Yunni continued to probe about the prototype machine's progress, particularly its performance data.

After all, she had worked with Jin Jun for some time and had a good understanding of the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's performance and data at various levels.

Of course, her knowledge was limited to the prototype machine's data.

The true Heavenly Sun Radiance God was a military-grade puppet. To unlock its full military-grade performance, it required a Military Certificate, modifications to remove its operational restrictions, and a subsequent surge in its performance data.

Watching Su Yunni's persistent questioning, Zi Yunzhen couldn't help but smile inwardly, already guessing the purpose of her visit.

Finally, Zi Yunzhen said, "Alright, I'll tell you the truth. Zhang Yu has already submitted the prototype machine for evaluation."

"They actually applied for review?" Su Yunni asked, her voice filled with disbelief. "Zhang Yu's prototype machine has already reached Level 11?"

"Level 11?" Zi Yunzhen scoffed. "Yun Ni, I can't pretend I didn't hear that."

After all, Zi Yunzhen herself had personally led half of the Project Team, handling all the crucial foundational work and working overtime tirelessly to achieve this breakthrough. This project was the highlight of her resume, the experience she would proudly showcase at the top.

For this, she had even worked as Zhang Yu's assistant for a meager 2 Spirit Coins per month, putting in far more overtime than she had ever done on any previous project. How could she possibly tolerate Su Yunni belittling the project's achievements right in front of her?

Zi Yunzhen declared proudly, "In just two months, our Project Team advanced the prototype machine from Level 1 to a full Level 15 before submitting it for review."

"Level 15? In two months? That's impossible!" Su Yunni instinctively refused to believe it.

Seeing Su Yunni's shocked expression, Zi Yunzhen smiled and used her Bionic Eye to capture the moment. "Yun Ni," she continued, "the Path of Artifact Refinement is ruthless. There will always be someone researching how to do things faster, better, and cheaper than you."

"As assistants, the most crucial skill is choosing the right projects, and the key to that is judging people."

"Your grades are good, but your judgment of character still needs work."

"Jin Jun? I saw through his ambition and lack of substance last year. He's just a dried-up bone in a tomb."

"Zhang Yu, on the other hand, I recognized from the project's inception as a rough gem buried in Civil Engineering. He possesses an extraordinary intuition and inspiration for artifact refinement. That's why I agreed to join his Project Team after his repeated invitations."

Hearing Zi Yunzhen's confident words, Su Yunni thought to herself, "You were just calling him 'that stinky Civil Engineering guy' last year."

Still, Zi Yunzhen's unwavering conviction made Su Yunni believe at least a third of what she said about the Level 15 prototype machine.

The thought of Jin Jun's Project Team ultimately losing to Zhang Yu's now filled Su Yunni with anxiety.

As Zi Yunzhen and Su Yunni were talking, Fu Xinyao slowly approached, hoping to get closer to the two students from the Artifact Refinement Department.

But in the next instant, a thunderous shout erupted from behind her.

"It's her! Arrest her!"

Fu Xinyao whirled around to see Yu Xinghan pointing at her, declaring, "It's her! She pretends to offer unlicensed massages but is actually practicing dual cultivation!"

"She lures customers with cheap massages, then forces them into dual cultivation. Who knows how many people she's tricked, secretly stealing their vital energy and Magic Power!"

As two Patrol Team Members approached, Fu Xinyao glared fiercely at Yu Xinghan, cursing inwardly, "Damn it... why is this kid reporting me again?"

One Patrol Team Member eyed her and said, "You again, you lousy Vocational College student? This time it's not just a few days of overtime."

The other added, "Take her back and confiscate her tools."

Fu Xinyao's heart tightened. She quickly warned Ping Han and the other Soul Cultivators, "Remember, the Bionics are protected by a restriction set by Divine Monarch Jade Nectar. Ordinary cultivators can't trace their origins."

"No matter how they interrogate you, don't let anything slip."

Watching Fu Xinyao's retreating figure, Yu Xinghan nodded in satisfaction. His gaze then swept over a nearby worker lounging lazily, and his brow furrowed involuntarily.

Recently, many workers on the construction site had shown a decline in productivity, even reducing their working hours.

What surprised Yu Xinghan even more was that amidst the city's massive infrastructure projects and widespread labor shortages, as workers voluntarily reduced their overtime, the company's wages had actually increased.

Uncertain how long this anomaly would persist, Yu Xinghan worried whether it was a scheme or conspiracy orchestrated by the Dual Rest Demonic Sect.

Meanwhile, after her conversation with Zi Yunzhen, Su Yunni returned with the news.

As soon as she reached the laboratory, she hurried to find Jin Jun.

She found him manipulating True Fire, continuously imbuing the woven Magic Power Circuits into the prototype machine using artifact refinement equipment.

Noticing Su Yunni's arrival, Jin Jun didn't speak, but sent a message: Wait until I finish this task.

After etching a complete Magic Power Circuit, Jin Jun paused the artifact refinement equipment, looked up at Su Yunni, and calmly asked, "Alright, what's the situation?"

Su Yunni replied, "Zhang Yu has pushed his prototype machine to Level 15!"

Jin Jun was momentarily stunned, then chuckled. "You actually believe such an absurd claim?"

"Exaggeration and alarmism — I didn't expect to master these two skills so thoroughly after just a year in the Artifact Refinement Department."

Jin Jun analyzed the situation seriously. "It's only been two months since he refined his Level 1 prototype machine, right? How many Heavenly Chosen in the history of the Artifact Refinement Department have achieved such a feat? Zhang Yu only transferred from the Civil Engineering Department a year ago — how could he possibly manage this?"

Su Yunni said, "I don't believe it either, but Zi Yunzhen didn't seem to be lying."

Jin Jun pondered for a moment, then shook his head. "Let's ignore him."

By now, Jin Jun had come to a clear conclusion. Whether Zhang Yu was bluffing or had genuinely made progress, there was no need for him to concern himself.

After all, his own prototype machine had only just reached Level 11. Even if he submitted it for evaluation, the chances of passing were slim.

"The most important thing now is to focus all our energy on refining the prototype machine and doing our own work well," Jin Jun said.

After speaking, he instructed Su Yunni not to reveal any news about Zhang Yu's progress within the Project Team before refocusing his attention on the task at hand.

As for Zhang Yu refining a Level 15 prototype machine? Between belief and disbelief, his heart ultimately leaned heavily toward "disbelief."

Despite this, he still sent a message to the Project Team group chat, summoning all assistants who were relaxing during class back early to continue refining the prototype machine with renewed urgency.

A few days later, a message flashed in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's Bionic Eye. It was from Vice-Principal True Monarch Cloud Haven.

True Monarch Cloud Haven: Congratulations! Another one of your disciples has earned a Military Certificate.

True Monarch Cloud Haven: The Artifact Refinement Department has been producing exceptional talents these past few years.

The notification confirmed that Zhang Yu had passed the evaluation and obtained the Military Artifact Refining Engineering Certificate (Class A).

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: All thanks to your excellent leadership, Principal.

After exchanging a few pleasantries with True Monarch Cloud Haven, True Monarch Magnetic Pole pondered for a moment before forwarding the notification to True Monarch Dawnlight, the Vice Director of the Artifact Refinement Department.

True Monarch Dawnlight had previously competed with True Monarch Magnetic Pole during the research on the Soul Transformation Bionic. However, after a stern reprimand from True Monarch Magnetic Pole, he had become considerably more compliant.

Seeing Zhang Yu's Military Certificate notification, True Monarch Magnetic Pole decided to assign him a task.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Have someone issue this Military Certificate to Zhang Yu.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Make it a proper ceremony — not ostentatious, but not understated either.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: While you're at it, let it be known that Zhang Yu is my personally mentored disciple.

Reading the message from True Monarch Magnetic Pole, True Monarch Dawnlight's heart stirred slightly. He thought to himself, "Hmph, so Zhang Yu really is Magnetic Pole's disciple?"

Although Magnetic Pole had never formally announced Zhang Yu's status as her disciple after transferring him to the Artifact Refinement Department, most people who had heard rumors about their relationship assumed Zhang Yu was merely a promising artifact refinement material that Magnetic Pole had taken an interest in. However, Vice Director Dawnlight, with his keen observation skills, had noticed subtle clues.

Dawnlight mused, "Was she deliberately withholding the formal announcement, fearing the Civil Engineering brat wouldn't achieve anything and become a liability during her Soul Transformation evaluation?"

"But now that he's produced results, it's become another highlight on his record."

Despite his internal grumbling, Dawnlight dared not disregard True Monarch Magnetic Pole's instructions. After all, she still held evidence of his company's counterfeit goods.

"Handle it spectacularly?" He reread Magnetic Pole's message repeatedly, understanding that while she cautioned against arrogance, the "but" that followed was the key.

"No need for subtlety."

Streams of radiant light exploded across the Artifact Refinement Department's office building, accompanied by ethereal Immortal music that filled the air.

Simultaneously, countless Teachers' Bionic Eyes displayed the news of Zhang Yu's Military Certificate achievement.

The Artifact Refinement Department's Director received a message from True Monarch Dawnlight, instructing him to send someone to award Zhang Yu the Military Certificate.

True Monarch Dawnlight: Make it grand and high-profile.

The Director pondered this, recording the Spirit Realm effects True Monarch Dawnlight had just activated and adding new requirements before seeking further instructions.

True Monarch Dawnlight: Don't you think this font looks too outdated?

True Monarch Dawnlight: And the color — I want it to highlight the unique character of our Artifact Refinement Department.

True Monarch Dawnlight: Adjust the brightness too.

After making the revisions, the Director sent the updated version to the Teaching Secretary.

Director: Make it even bigger.

Teaching Secretary: How about this? [File]

Director: Make the font even larger.

When True Person Refining Fire, Zhang Yu's class advisor, received the notification, he fell into deep thought.

"This is going too far. Zhang Yu... could he be True Monarch Magnetic Pole's son?"
