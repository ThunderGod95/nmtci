# Chapter 656: If Worse Comes to Worst, We'll Just Bankrupt Floors Two Through Six

Tian Shengong let out a long sigh, thinking, "Losing to one of the Ten Greats among the undergraduates isn't shameful."

He decided to review his race against Zhang Yu on his livestream in a few days, analyzing the route and strategies. This would likely generate another wave of buzz.

Then, Tian Shengong noticed a message from Extreme Tiger Company. "Can't reach Zhang Yu?" he wondered.

He forwarded the message to Zhang Yu: "Zhang Yu, interested in becoming Extreme Tiger's brand ambassador?"

Tian Shengong: "No matter how many Spirit Coins Myriad Dao offers, Extreme Tiger will offer 1,000 more."

"A top undergraduate as Extreme Tiger's ambassador? What a perfect match!" Tian Shengong thought to himself.

Meanwhile, at Celestial Monsters University, Ying Mingchi was directing Soul Cultivators to screenshot every scene from the Final Battle featuring dragon beasts, especially those with his name visible on the creatures.

"Hmph," Ying Mingchi sneered, "if Zhang Yu hadn't awakened his monster race potential, how could he have unleashed such increasingly powerful reserves of strength?"

"And without my dragon blood's assistance, how could he have possibly defeated Kuang Tianqing?"

"Now, does he finally understand the power of monsterfolk? Does he grasp the true strength within his own bloodline?" Ying Mingchi mused.

Ying Mingchi sent Zhang Yu a message: "Among the Immortal Sect Techniques, there is one called the Celestial Monsters Reincarnation Sutra..."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's former classmates were also sending him various messages.

Gongshu Jin: President Zhang, congratulations! After watching your match, my whole family urged me to study Civil Engineering properly so I can work at your company in the future.

Mo Shangjin: Zhang Yu, your journey has moved me deeply. Thanks to you, the Seven Absolutes Bionic sold for a good price to the university. I've decided to use that money as seed capital to pursue graduate studies in the Artifact Refinement Department.

Feng Tingting: Senior! When are you holding the press conference? Do you plan to announce your choice of Immortal Sect Technique beforehand?

Bei Wufeng: A beautiful victory! Don't rush to return the flying sword. Keep it as long as you like.

Shi Huaiyu: Zhang Yu, you don't need to tell me which Immortal Sect Technique you're choosing. Just tell me what you think will happen to Myriad Laws' stock and cryptocurrency prices — will they rise or fall?

Yu Xinghan: What's going on? The university said they're inviting the Old Man from the Spirit Realm to your award ceremony. Did you know about this?

Ying Xin: Boss, the recruitment email is overflowing! So many people are applying, it's impossible to keep up.

In the temporary medical room, precious medicines and state-of-the-art equipment had been transported here, all for Zhang Yu's treatment.

Several Nascent Soul True Monarchs from Myriad Laws University's Medical Faculty were explaining the treatment process to Zhang Yu with gentle smiles.

Though they explained everything clearly and simply, Zhang Yu, exhausted from prolonged and desperate battles, felt too weary to listen any longer.

He cut to the chase: "Will this cost me anything?"

The True Monarchs smiled. "The university will cover all medical expenses."

"Then proceed with the treatment," Zhang Yu said.

The Nascent Soul True Monarchs' methods were so advanced that Zhang Yu felt no pain during the entire process. It was as if he were soaking in warm, soothing water, utterly comfortable.

In this blissful state, Zhang Yu, who had been pushing himself to the limit for far too long, gradually relaxed and drifted into a deep, unconscious sleep.

Even the ritual seemed to recognize his exhaustion and ceased its effects, as if acknowledging he had reached his limit and needed rest.

When Zhang Yu awoke, he paused, confused. "I fell asleep?"

"How long have I been asleep?"

Zhang Yu had thought he would never sleep again, spending every day and night working and studying. Now, suddenly waking up, he felt a surge of shame.

"Student Zhang Yu, you're awake."

Zhang Yu looked toward the voice and saw an academic overachiever from the Medical Faculty, ranked 35th in the entire school.

"How did I fall asleep?" Zhang Yu asked. "Why didn't anyone wake me?"

The other student smiled slightly. "You were too exhausted. A little rest won't hurt."

"Sleep is a fault for others."

"But for you, it's justified. It's a luxury reserved for the strong, like you."

Zhang Yu paused, surprised, and didn't reply. Instead, he checked the time with his Bionic Eye and found he had slept for about two hours.

Then he sensed his physical condition and discovered that all his injuries had been completely healed, leaving him in perfect health.

However, he had been returned to his physical body, and all his Seven Absolutes Bionics were gone.

The student beside him explained, "The Seven Absolutes Bionics have been sent for maintenance."

"Actually, your Bionic Eye is also damaged. However, considering privacy concerns, we didn't remove it. Would you like us to send it for repair?"

Zhang Yu shook his head. "I can repair the Bionic Eye myself."

The Bionic Eye was located in a vital area of his head, and Zhang Yu had always prioritized its protection during intense battles. Though damaged, it still maintained basic functionality.

As Zhang Yu watched the messages scrolling across his Bionic Eye, he felt as if he were being drowned in a sea of voices.

The sheer volume of messages overwhelmed him, making it impossible to read them all.

Deciding to ignore them for now, Zhang Yu turned to the medical student beside him. "How's Bai Zhenzhen? Do you know?"

The student replied, "Divine Monarch Seven Emotions has already taken her away. We don't have any further details."

Zhang Yu sent a message to Bai Zhenzhen, but received no response.

He then began browsing news from the Spirit Realm, selecting articles he deemed important to read.

Moments later, a holographic projection materialized in the air — Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution from Myriad Laws University.

Looking at Zhang Yu before him, the Divine Monarch with the youthful appearance smiled slightly. "Zhang Yu, you're awake? How are you feeling? Let me know if you need anything."

"Focus on recovering well and preparing for tomorrow's award ceremony."

"As for all the nonsense circulating in the Spirit Realm lately, just ignore it. Don't pay any attention to it."

Zhang Yu chuckled bitterly. "So the whole world wants me to choose an Immortal Sect Technique that suits their preferences, huh?"

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution replied calmly, "Why bother caring about the opinions of a bunch of failures?"

"Zhang Yu, you're now a top priority for Myriad Laws University. We'll guide you to the Golden Core, Nascent Soul, and even Soul Transformation stages."

"Your task is to select the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm, then dedicate yourself to studying this cultivation art, extracting its core techniques, and preparing for the construction of the Dharma Realm."

Zhang Yu looked at Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution and asked, "After choosing this cultivation art, will I be able to join a sect?"

"Yes," the Divine Monarch replied.

"I'll recommend you to the upper sects. With your achievements, getting accepted will be easy."

As Zhang Yu listened to the Divine Monarch's words, he nodded slightly to indicate his understanding. However, he also knew in his heart that even if he could join the sect, it would only be after he had established a reputation through his research on the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm.

"If the construction of the Dharma Realm hasn't even begun, and I'm admitted to the sect simply for choosing a cultivation art... wouldn't that choice be meaningless for many others?"

Zhang Yu had anticipated this outcome. For him, securing entry into the sect was the priority; spending extra time to achieve it was both reasonable and necessary. He had never dreamed of instant success, always climbing step by step, knowing that this steady approach was the only way to build a solid foundation.

Next, Zhang Yu asked another question: "Divine Monarch, how does the school plan to construct the Dharma Realm?"

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution replied calmly, "Specific arrangements will be made after you refine the technology. Everything must be based on practical considerations, not empty talk."

Zhang Yu refused to be brushed off so easily.

He knew that in the day before the awards ceremony, his influence was at its peak. He needed to seize this moment to prepare for what lay ahead.

"Once I choose a particular Immortal Sect Technique..." Zhang Yu thought to himself, "I'll inevitably face attacks from its opponents."

"Immortal Sect Techniques contain world-altering technologies."

"Compared to the profits of changing the world, the resources needed to advance me to the Golden Core, Nascent Soul, or even Soul Transformation stages... pale in comparison."

"How could I make such a crucial decision without fully understanding the risks and rewards involved?"

Especially since Zhang Yu preferred establishing his own channels and frameworks for generating wealth over simply receiving money directly from others.

He didn't want to rely entirely on their financial support until he reached the Soul Transformation stage.

Moreover... Zhang Yu wanted to understand the Dharma Realm's true impact on the world and how it would transform everyone's lives.

Facing the Soul Transformation Divine Monarch before him, Zhang Yu felt the weight of the man's authority. He forced himself to meet the Divine Monarch's gaze and said as calmly as he could, "Principal, I want to know about the Dharma Realm's construction process, its goals... and my place within it. I want to understand how the Dharma Realm will change the world."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's eyes flickered slightly as he smiled at Zhang Yu.

"This kid wants more information to assess the profits and risks?" he thought. "He wants to participate in the Dharma Realm's construction, wants to... have a seat at the table?"

"Zhang Yu," the Divine Monarch said, "the Dharma Realm's waters run too deep for you to grasp at your current level. The more you know, the more it will work against you..."

The oppressive aura of a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch washed over them. The medical student beside Zhang Yu began to tremble.

But Zhang Yu gritted his teeth and insisted, "Principal, I want to know."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution studied the unwavering determination in Zhang Yu's eyes, glanced at the Divine Protection Talisman on his person, and finally shook his head. "Then come with me."

Inside Dao Qiankun's Spirit Hall, Li Shiwei, the second-ranked student in the Dao Techniques Department, slowly approached, saying, "Brother Dao, Zhang Yu took first place. He defeated Kuang Tianqing, and Myriad Laws won..."

But before she could finish, she stared in shock at the empty platform. "Where's Brother Dao's corpse?"

Soon after, news of Dao Qiankun's stolen corpse gradually spread, but by then, few people cared.

Meanwhile, in University City at Myriad Laws University, Ping Han trembled as he watched the news of Zhang Yu's victory, feeling as if his heart were bleeding.

"How could he have won? How could Zhang Yu possibly defeat a Heavenly Chosen like Kuang Tianqing?"

However, as he read the subsequent reports from Joyful Union University, Ping Han's expression grew increasingly grave.

"All the schools are mobilizing their forces, gathering at the university borders," he exclaimed. "Is this the prelude to a full-scale war?"

Just then, a wisp of Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's consciousness reached him, instructing them to proceed with their recently planned operation.

Ping Han knew that the communication was merely a wisp of Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Soul Transformation consciousness. As a powerhouse at the Soul Transformation realm, Divine Monarch Jade Nectar could simultaneously influence hundreds or even thousands of regions and communicate with countless individuals.

Like the brain of Jade Nectar University, controlling its countless tentacles and assets to strike at myriad targets, the economic crises and financial storms she could unleash filled Ping Han with dread.

At the same moment, Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations' figure materialized in the Spirit Realm, addressing Divine Monarch Jade Nectar: "Jade Nectar, I don't recall inviting you to Myriad Laws."

Divine Monarch Jade Nectar replied coldly, "Myriad Transformations, if Zhang Yu chooses an Immortal Sect Technique he shouldn't have, then let the battle begin."

Myriad Transformations stared at the message, his eyes burning with murderous intent. "You want total war? Aren't you afraid the economic crisis will sweep all the way to the sixth layer?"

Just then, Divine Monarch Unrestrained of Heavenly Demon University interjected: "So what? We'll just bankrupt layers two through six and start over. We'll reincarnate and be done with it."
