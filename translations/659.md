# Chapter 659: Returning Home in Glory (Part 2)

Tianhai College.

"Student Zhou Chechen, as the former student council president of your high school, what was your first impression of Zhang Yu?"

Facing the camera, Zhou Chechen stated firmly, "From the moment I first met Zhang Yu, I sensed he was extraordinary, destined for greater things. I was certain he would one day be admitted to the Ten Greats."

"Rumor has it that you and Zhang Yu had a conflict during your high school years?"

Zhou Chechen's gaze drifted blankly. "Songyang High School has a long history, experienced teachers, and a strong academic culture..."

"Student Zhou, I'm asking specifically about whether you and Zhang Yu had a conflict in high school."

Zhou Chechen's lips twitched slightly. "Don't... don't..." he whispered.

"Hmm? Focus the camera. What did you say, Student Zhou?"

In a voice barely audible above a mosquito's buzz, Zhou Chechen repeated, "Don't say it... don't say it..."

Another corner of Tianhai College.

"Student Qian Shen, what kind of person do you think Zhang Yu was in high school?"

"Someone who evolved more completely than I did, breaking free from the high school grading system. Judging by his current performance, I believe the university grading system will also undergo reforms due to Zhang Yu's influence..."

Within the University City of Myriad Laws University.

Mo Shangjin nodded. "I've decided to follow Student Zhang Yu's example and break free from Civil Engineering. Yes, he's inspired many of us in the department."

Feng Tingting said, "When I first joined the Civil Engineering Department, I felt incredibly discouraged. But Student Zhang Yu's achievements showed me that even barren land can bloom with flowers. I plan to immerse myself in my studies, aiming to shine brightly in the field of civil engineering and delve deeply into intelligent building design."

A sleepy-eyed Su Yanyang remarked, "During the economic crisis, he was the only one willing to lend me money. Even Nascent Soul cultivators refused, but he lent me money. For that alone, I think he's even more impressive than a Nascent Soul cultivator."

Shi Huaiyu faced the camera and said, "Zhang Yu is a good boss. I trust him."

Shi Yunxiang said, "President Zhang's salary increase is the highest on the Kunxu Second Layer right now. Even if he discriminates against monsterfolk, I'll still work for him."

Xiao Qingxuan said, "He's the best boss I've ever had. How do I put it... If I had a Golden Core, I'd give it to President Zhang to blow up."

Ying Xin said, "My whole family has been working for President Zhang for years. He's incredibly hardworking, whether studying or working. He always responds to my work messages, no matter the time or place."

Yu Xinghan said, "Zhang Yu and I have a life-or-death friendship. To be honest... if Zhang Yu wasn't so strict about original gender or if I were a woman, I would have let him drain me dry with dual cultivation techniques before the competition."

Yu Xinghan looked at the invitation in his hand and asked, "Is this an invitation to the awards ceremony?"

Tu Lishan nodded. "The school asked Zhang Yu to select a few students to attend the ceremony, and you're one of them."

Moments later, Yu Xinghan posted the invitation in the school group and the Hometown Group, instantly sparking envy among the members.

Le Mulan looked into the camera and said, "I've watched Zhang Yu struggle and fight his way to the top..."

Le Mulan turned to Professor Yin Jiurao, who looked visibly ashamed. "Ah, during the economic crisis, I shouldn't have taken advantage of Zhang Yu's vulnerability," Yin Jiurao said.

The thought of the news about the Ten Great League Champion being exploited by a professor from Myriad Laws University potentially surfacing made Yin Jiurao sigh.

"Contact Zhang Yu," Yin Jiurao said. "If he doesn't pursue the matter, I'll compensate him."

"And Mulan, you..." Yin Jiurao pushed forward a sample. "This is a reserve I kept for research. I can share it with you. We can study it together, and I'll credit you as a co-author on the paper."

Looking at the sample before her and hearing Yin Jiurao's proposal, Le Mulan instinctively swallowed hard.

Meanwhile, within the Spirit Realm:

True Person Starfire gazed at the live broadcast of the Final Battle, his eyes sweeping across the news headlines. "It's been ages since we've had this much Spirit Realm Flow available," he remarked. "The school is being quite generous this time."

Li Xuelian, standing beside him, said, "Who could have imagined? In less than five years, Zhang Yu has advanced to this level."

She turned to True Person Starfire. "Father, they want to invite you to the award ceremony. What are your plans?"

True Person Starfire sighed. "The award ceremony... I never thought I'd be returning to the Second Layer so soon."

Hearing this, Li Xuelian's heart stirred, realizing her father intended to visit the Second Layer.

But thinking of the vortex Zhang Yu had been drawn into, she frowned slightly. "Father, are you sure you want to go?"

True Person Starfire replied, "My meridians are practically stagnating from staying in the First Layer. It's time for me to move again."

Li Xuelian cautioned, "Father, Zhang Yu is in serious trouble this time. One wrong move... it's not just about being crushed to dust."

True Person Starfire waved it off. "I'm just going to talk to him. It's nothing to worry about."

"My disciple must be overwhelmed with confusion right now."

"The sect probably wants me to discuss the actual situation with him."

"Oh, where's Yu Xinghan? I'll head to Myriad Laws tomorrow before the ceremony. Tell him to come pick me up."

Kunxu Third Layer.

Zhang Pianpian's consciousness flowed through the Spirit Realm.

Suddenly, her eyes snapped open, countless streams of information swirling within them.

"They've even found me here?"

"Very well."

"I'll go."

As Zhang Yu left the temporary camp at Divine Monarch Unrestrained's invitation, everyone inside and outside the Ten Greats League arena received a message:

"Zhang Yu, Foundation Establishment Student of the Artifact Refinement Department at Myriad Laws University, Ten Greats League Champion, and the strongest undergraduate, is now in the same spatial dimension as you. Any malicious attack against him will incur a penalty of 1 million Spirit Coins per second. Exercise caution and restraint."

In an instant, countless teachers and students who received the message retreated further and further, desperate to distance themselves by hundreds or even thousands of miles.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu had already arrived above the floating continent, quietly observing the arena below.

A beam of divine light descended, carrying Divine Monarch Unrestrained's voice: "Let's talk here."

As he spoke, layers of dark, shimmering clouds enveloped the heavens and earth.

Simultaneously, the Weather Penalty timer began ticking. Divine Monarch Unrestrained casually produced a credit card, allowing the penalty to accumulate unchecked, and paid no further attention to it.

After casually altering the weather, Divine Monarch Unrestrained said calmly, "There are too many eyes in the Spirit Realm. I don't want our conversation to be constantly monitored by Celestial Evolution. You wouldn't want that either, would you?"

Zhang Yu neither confirmed nor denied this, simply asking, "Divine Monarch, what did you want to discuss with me?"

Divine Monarch Unrestrained replied succinctly, "Zhang Yu, I won't bore you with grand principles. Let's talk about your personal interests."

"You want to join a sect, don't you?"

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened as he glanced at the divine light beside him.

Divine Monarch Unrestrained continued, "Don't be surprised. Your intentions are too obvious, and your ascent through the First Layer has been far too ostentatious. If I were your backer, I wouldn't have allowed such a blatant display."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "So he suspects I have a patron?"

Divine Monarch Unrestrained pressed on, "It's natural for someone with your potential to seek entry into a sect."

"But I must warn you: choosing the Dharma Realm will only make it harder for you to achieve that goal."

Zhang Yu asked calmly, "Why?"

Divine Monarch Unrestrained replied, "How advanced do you think the Dharma Realm's technology is?"

"The ability to freely transmit Magic Power, Gang Qi, cultivation, and even realms of existence... How much time do you think you'd need to explore and research the Immortal Dao Technology behind such feats?"

"Moreover... do you really think your current level of skill is enough to play a leading role in the Dharma Realm?"

Divine Monarch Unrestrained shook his head. "Absolutely not. Choosing the Dharma Realm means you'll merely be a key to unlock it, a translator of Immortal Dao Technology."

"Once you disseminate the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm, you'll be quickly outstripped by the Soul Transformation cultivators during the subsequent massive construction and technological advancement."

"At the same time, you'll be firmly bound to this grand project, standing at the forefront under immense pressure, and embroiled in the Soul Transformation cultivators' scheming and infighting. One misstep could cost you everything."

"Wouldn't choosing the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm make it even harder to join a sect? Wouldn't it place even more obstacles in your path?"

Zhang Yu remained silent, listening intently to Divine Monarch Unrestrained's words.

Undeterred, Divine Monarch Unrestrained continued, "In contrast, the Eternal Spring Sutra is far simpler. With your talent and aptitude, you could master its Longevity Technology within a few years and extend the lifespans of others."

"Your teacher, your classmates, your friends... don't you want them to live longer?"

"Even if you yourself gain ten thousand years of life, would you still worry about finding an opportunity to join a sect?"

"Zhang Yu, rather than choosing the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm and triggering an explosive surge in Immortal Dao Technology, plunging yourself into the most terrifying, intense, and perilous conflicts of the lower realms, wouldn't it be better to select the Eternal Spring Sutra? Live a steady, fulfilling life for many more years, and wait for a truly opportune moment."

"Besides, Longevity Technology won't diminish your earnings. Once you accumulate a certain number of Spirit Coins, the difference becomes negligible for someone like us."

"After all, without joining a sect, you can only reach the Soul Transformation stage at best. Even if the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm allows you to earn ten or a hundred times more, you'll still be limited to the Soul Transformation realm. What significant difference would that make?"

"Think it over carefully. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me anytime."

"Myriad Laws can protect you, and your backers can support you. We and our backers can do the same."

Watching Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's figure vanish, Zhang Yu had to admit he was tempted.

The pressure from the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm was overwhelming. Compared to that future filled with unknowns, risks, and uncontrollable factors, the Eternal Spring Sutra suddenly seemed stable, manageable, and reassuring.

But choosing the Eternal Spring Sutra would mean betraying Myriad Laws and throwing himself into the embrace of the Four Heavenly Demon Schools.

Thinking of the individuals at Myriad Laws University, Zhang Yu couldn't help but sigh deeply. He stood motionless, silent for a long time.

At that moment, there were still twelve hours until the award ceremony began.
