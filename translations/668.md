# Chapter 668: The Descent of Chaos

Though Zhang Yu addressed the elder as "Vocational College Golden Core," he remembered the information Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had provided. He knew this old man wasn't a Vocational College student, but a Vocational College Teacher.

A cultivator who could become a Vocational College Teacher couldn't possibly be a Vocational College graduate. At minimum, they would have graduated from Lower College or Upper College.

As for the Vocational College's upper echelons, such as the principal and vice-principal, many were graduates of the Ten Great Universities.

For instance, the Vocational College principal who had invited Zhang Yu during his senior year of high school was a graduate of Joyful Union University.

True Vocational College students were all at the Qi Refining Realm. Even if they had broken through without authorization, they would only reach Foundation Establishment at most — Golden Core was out of the question.

Zhang Yu estimated that even if Vocational College students immediately broke through to Foundation Establishment without authorization, their chances of further advancing from Foundation Establishment to Golden Core within the "three-year deadline" timeframe remained extremely low. In other words, a genuine Golden Core Realm Vocational College student currently didn't exist.

The gap between Vocational College students and the Vocational College Teacher before him was as vast as the difference between clouds and mud.

After all, even before breaking through without authorization, these teachers had already been Foundation Establishment cultivators for many years, making them the envy of all Vocational College students.

Zhang Yu was genuinely surprised to discover that the Vocational College Teacher before him might have achieved Core Formation and reached the Golden Core Realm.

When the teacher revealed that he had formed his core because he couldn't afford a Golden Core, Zhang Yu began to ponder.

"Working at the Second Layer for over a century at the Foundation Establishment level, and still unable to afford a Golden Core?"

Zhang Yu sighed inwardly, "Kunxu earns, Kunxu spends; not a single coin can be taken home..."

But then he reconsidered, "Wait, even though Kunxu Spirit Coins are spent lavishly, it's not impossible for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to save two or three Spirit Coins a year after working. Over a hundred years, they could potentially afford a Golden Core before dying of old age. The real problem is... the lack of certification. Without it, they wouldn't even consider saving up for a Golden Core."

Just then, the battles in other directions concluded.

Ye Xingli, radiating starlight, appeared behind Zhang Yu unnoticed and said, "It's over, Zhang Yu. Bring them over for the assembly."

Seeing Hou Feifeng's face flushed with anger, Ye Xingli assumed Zhang Yu had provoked him. She remarked, "Did you provoke them too? These Vocational College Teachers are weak in both strength and mentality. A few words can throw them off balance. Provocation and mockery are surprisingly effective."

"I wonder if it's because they've been at the Vocational College for too long, their 'Junior College Content' is too high, or maybe it's just their age... Their mental state isn't much different from the Junior College Students."

As a disciple of Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, Ye Xingli naturally held her Teacher's teachings in high regard. According to the Divine Monarch, in battles against weaker opponents, it was crucial to defeat them with minimal effort and cost — a principle vital in warfare.

"Exams and competitions are about explosive power, requiring you to unleash your full strength in a short time. But in war, you must conserve resources and control costs."

To Ye Xingli, interfering with an opponent's combat state through a few provocative words was an incredibly cost-effective tactic. After all, words cost next to nothing.

Hearing Ye Xingli compare him to a Junior College student, Hou Feifeng grew even more furious. "Are we the same as Junior College students? They're just trash!"

As a Vocational College Teacher, Hou Feifeng looked down on Junior College students more than anyone else. In his own words, "I teach them myself. Who knows better than me how worthless they are?"

Observing his agitated state, Ye Xingli didn't respond, but silently recorded with her Bionic Eye: "Highly effective. Control effect is strong..."

Zhang Yu, standing nearby, was unfazed by this display. In Kunxu, such hierarchies were commonplace: the Ten Greats looked down on Upper College and Lower College, Upper and Lower College looked down on Vocational College, Vocational College looked down on High Schools, elite High Schools looked down on ordinary High Schools...

Just then, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's voice echoed through the battlefield: "Assemble within one minute."

Surveying the wild Golden Cores scattered across the ground, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole remarked with feigned concern, "Why did you injure them so severely?"

Despite her seemingly caring tone, Zhang Yu knew better. She wasn't genuinely concerned; she intended to capture these wild Golden Cores and force them to work for her.

Just then, Zhang Yu's gaze shifted as he sensed he was being watched.

He turned his head and saw several heads huddled together like a nest of rats, hiding in the ruins and staring at them with terrified expressions.

"These must be..." Zhang Yu thought to himself, "the Junior College Students captured by the Vocational College Teachers."

All around them, people bustled about, transporting the bound wild Golden Cores onto Flying Boats and meticulously inspecting the vast quantities of supplies being moved from the factory.

Yet this group of Junior College Students remained completely ignored. Whether Hou Feifeng was escaping, the battle raged, or Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole tallied the spoils of war, no one paid them any attention.

While some might still care about the severity of the Vocational College Teachers' injuries or pity their ability to continue working, these Junior College Students were treated like wisps of transparent green smoke.

In the eyes of the others, they seemed to barely exist. No matter what injuries they sustained, what losses they suffered, or whether they cried out, no one seemed to notice.

Watching this scene, Zhang Yu sighed again, knowing this was the reality of Kunxu.

In Kunxu, only those with practical value or sufficient strength mattered. Otherwise, whether you were good or bad, whatever you endured, no one cared.

While Junior College Students as a whole might garner some attention in Kunxu, as individuals, they were like weeds, utterly ignored.

Zhang Yu approached them. Seeing them recoil in alarm, he casually tossed them a few Sleep-Free Pills.

"Take these. They'll keep you awake."

The Junior College Students' faces lit up at the sight of the Sleep-Free Pills. They scrambled for them, quickly dividing the pills according to their usual exam scores.

After swallowing the pills, the students' drowsy eyes snapped open. The sleep-deprived group instantly became alert and refreshed.

Zhang Yu noticed two corpses lying nearby. "Were they your classmates? Were they beaten to death?" he asked.

The top-performing Junior College Student stepped forward and said, "Manfen owed too much debt. He didn't want to work here for free and tried to escape. The Teacher caught him, beat him to death, and hung his body on the wall as a warning to the rest of us."

Watching this scene, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Just as Director Gao said, without the Righteous Gods maintaining order, cultivators will treat the weak as slaves."

"Slaughter, destruction, plunder... these will likely become even more rampant."

Zhang Yu looked up at the distant horizon, at the Fifth Layer Sky where fierce battles still raged. He sighed inwardly, "Brother Dao hoped to change Kunxu, to change this world where weakness is a disgrace. But Brother Dao..."

"The mess you've left behind... given the Kunxu People's nature, without the restraints of order, they'll only become more ruthless, treating the weak with even greater contempt, and spawning hordes of bandits who burn, kill, plunder, and commit every imaginable atrocity."

"You must have known that in the Second to Fifth Layers, there might not be a single person who shares your ideals."

"Was sacrificing so much to face the Heavenly Court's inevitable return truly worth it?"

Lady Fortune said, "No matter how I think about it, this fellow's actions seem utterly impractical. Perhaps this is just the capriciousness of an Immortal. To him... perhaps the cost doesn't matter at all. He simply wants to do it, enjoys doing it, and has the power to do it, so he does it."

"Throughout history, countless such powerful figures have arbitrarily reshaped cities, nations, the world, and even the entire Kunxu. This has always been the prerogative of the strong."

Zhang Yu sighed, realizing he was overthinking things. Such grand questions were beyond the grasp of a mere Golden Core True Person like himself.

In the Kunxu World, protecting even a few of his own people was an immense challenge. Using the rules of the Ten Greats League to influence the world's trajectory was already the limit of what he could achieve.

Shaking his head, Zhang Yu addressed the Junior College Students before him. "You can all return safely. No harm will come to you here."

Having said this, he turned to leave, but his gaze suddenly froze.

"Wait..."

Zhang Yu turned back to examine the two Junior College Students' corpses, realizing that one of them wasn't actually dead.

"Still alive? Asleep?"

"How can he be sleeping through all this commotion?"

Sensing something amiss, Zhang Yu immediately reported the situation to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Soon, someone arrived to examine the sleeping Junior College Student.

The problem quickly became apparent...

"A virus," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said, her voice heavy as she gazed at the Blood Moon hanging in the sky. "The Demonic Sect is secretly spreading viruses through this Moon. And it's not just the Dual Rest Virus — there's also the Ascension Virus and the Unemployment Virus. These are likely new creations of the Evil God."

"However, they're spreading them selectively, primarily targeting those with weak resistance."

"Junior College Students, with their inherently weak dao hearts, are particularly vulnerable. Being asleep only leaves their wills even more exposed."

"But you must also be vigilant at all times. Try to avoid being exposed to the moonlight as much as possible. As long as you're under its glow, you're within their attack range."

Zhang Yu's heart jolted at these words. "Under this Blood Moon, who knows how many new members the Demonic Sect is creating each day?"

"Especially in these chaotic times..."

Zhang Yu's brow furrowed. "Dual Rest and Unemployment will both reduce income, creating more impoverished people and driving them to crime, arson, and looting, further destabilizing the world."

"And the Ascension Virus... Given the Demonic Sect's and Evil Gods' methods, it's unlikely to be simple."

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole was considering the broader implications. "Without Righteous Gods, the cost of governance has already skyrocketed. Now, with the Blood Moon spreading this virus, maintaining even basic order will become exponentially more expensive."

She gazed at the fierce battle raging in the Fifth Layer Sky, thinking, "These fools are deliberately stalling us to buy time for their superiors' war. We must accelerate our operations..."

---

With the supplies unloaded, Zhang Yu and the others quickly returned to the Flying Boat.

Zhang Yu retrieved his share of the Potion, opened it, and injected it into his body.

As his vital energy surged violently, Physical Expression Factors began to emerge within him, gradually forming the Vajra Subduing Demons Dao Foundation.

In the Golden Core Realm, each increase in physical strength by one Level allows one to establish a Dao Foundation. Zhang Yu's Purple Mansion Golden Core, however, granted him the ability to establish two additional Dao Foundations when his physical strength reached Level 30, giving him a total of twelve Dao Foundations.

The process of establishing a Dao Foundation was straightforward: repeated injections of Potions or Transformation Surgery to awaken the Physical Expression Factors within the body.

The type of Dao Foundation obtained varied depending on the awakened Physical Expression Factors, with grades ranging from the lowest first grade to the highest fourth grade.

The Vajra Subduing Demons Dao Foundation, which Zhang Yu was activating with the Potion, was a fourth-grade Dao Foundation that granted the body a layer of damage reduction.

"My physical strength surged to Level 23.46 after breaking through. With another week or two of Potion injections, I should be able to complete the Vajra Subduing Demons Dao Foundation."

"I still have two types of Dao Foundation Potions left from the factory, enough to complete a Triple Dao Foundation. That should suffice for now."

"Normally, acquiring a fourth-grade Dao Foundation Potion would cost a fortune."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "But now I've gotten it for free, just like the Purple Mansion Golden Core."

Zhang Yu had to admit that while the Kunxu might become even more hellish for many weaker individuals, for him, it now presented even greater opportunities.

Half an hour later, the group from Heavenly Sword University parted ways with Zhang Yu's group.

Zhang Yu said, "A-Zhen, be careful on your way back. If anything happens during the day, contact me. I can ask my Teacher to help you."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded, smiling. "Yu Zi, safety first. We should avoid the battlefield whenever possible, unless it's a low-risk, high-reward situation like today."

Watching Bai Zhenzhen's retreating figure, Zhang Yu continued his journey back. Soon, the towering University City of Myriad Laws University came into view, its spires piercing the clouds.

Upon returning to University City, Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye quickly connected to the city's internal Spirit Realm.

Under the Blood Moon, each University City had activated its Spirit Realm Barrier, severing the connection to the Blood Moon.

Through his Bionic Eye's Nine Nether Demon Eye, Zhang Yu could see even more Soul Cultivators than before, floating throughout University City. They had replaced many of the Righteous Gods' original duties, maintaining basic order within the city.

Seeing University City functioning normally, Zhang Yu breathed a small sigh of relief.

Having realized the chaos raging outside, the once cramped and stifling Myriad Laws University's University City now seemed almost comfortable in his eyes.

Zhang Yu sighed inwardly, "At least University City feels safer right now..."

Lady Fortune scoffed, "No duh. Kunxu's order was oppressive, but at least it was order. Now, apart from the Ten Greats and the top-ranked Upper Colleges, the other schools will become survival-of-the-fittest jungles in no time."

"I'd wager that within a year or two, over ninety-nine percent of mortals and more than half of Qi Refining cultivators... will be dead."

Zhang Yu's heart sank at her words.

After winning the Ten Greats League Champion title, becoming the top student in the entire school, and advancing to the Golden Core Realm, Zhang Yu was assigned a much larger dormitory.

The eighty-square-meter space far exceeded his original thirty-square-meter luxury dorm, and it was fully equipped with all the cultivation equipment he needed.

Just as Zhang Yu finished moving in, he received a flood of messages from his classmates.

Mo Shangjin: Welcome back, congratulations on breaking through to the Golden Core Realm.

Feng Tingting: Senior, what's the situation outside? All news is being blocked. Is it chaotic?

Ying Xin: Boss, many Soul Cultivators from other regions can only work half-days now. Should we reduce their wages?

Zhang Yu couldn't help but smile wryly at this message.

In the past, when selecting Soul Cultivator talents, there was no distinction between locals and outsiders. But with the descent of the Blood Moon, each school became an isolated information island. The gap between local Soul Cultivators who could work 24 hours a day and outsiders who could only work during daylight hours suddenly widened.

"Typical Kunxu," Zhang Yu thought. "They establish new hierarchies of contempt so quickly."

Zhang Yu replied: Don't worry about that for now.

He thought to himself, "I need to find a chance to bring Old Zhao, Hu Yuntao, Mo Tianyi, and the others to Myriad Laws."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: I'm giving you half a day to rest and settle in. Missions will begin tomorrow.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: Prepare to work at full capacity.

Director Gao: Have you decided on your Golden Core title yet? Don't underestimate this. A person's name is crucial. Even the most powerful individual would be looked down upon if called "Trash True Person."

Director Gao: A good title can enhance your reputation. Take your time; you have a year to register it. Think carefully.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "The title of Golden Core True Person... this will affect my future titles as a Nascent Soul, Soul Transformation, and even higher-level cultivator. What should I choose?"

Bei Wufeng: You caused quite a stir at the Ten Greats League this time. You'll probably be directly promoted to graduate student soon. Don't worry about the flying sword for now; focus on your own matters first.

Seeing Bei Wufeng's message, Zhang Yu replied: Senior, I'll return the flying sword to you tomorrow. Thank you for your help.

Bei Wufeng read Zhang Yu's reply and sighed inwardly, "Ah, Zhang Yu has reached the Golden Core realm after all. It's only natural he wouldn't care for my Foundation Establishment flying sword."

After settling into his new dormitory and reviewing his messages, Zhang Yu wasted no time and immediately began cultivating in the Golden Core Realm.

He had already advanced Kunlun in the Palm to Level 30, and the various spatial technologies swirling in his mind made him realize a crucial truth.

"Relying solely on Kunlun in the Palm, with the spatial technologies accessible at the Golden Core level, it's unlikely I can effectively bypass the current spatial blockades."

Zhang Yu seemed to see two paths before him. One was to dive headfirst into researching spatial technologies, hoping to use his Level 30 spatial techniques to interfere with the blockades.

The other path was to rapidly enhance his cultivation, break through to the Nascent Soul stage as soon as possible, and then acquire Level 40 Spatial Technology before considering other options.

For Zhang Yu, the second path was the obvious choice.

"After all, given my talent, breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage would probably be easier than researching Spatial Technology."

Zhang Yu purchased the cultivation art titled "Golden Core Body Refinement Method." With a sudden surge of energy, he immediately began practicing this body refinement technique.

According to the Feather Book's calculations, the number of cultivation cycles required to advance from Level 1 to Level 30 was more than twice the number needed to reach Level 20. However, Zhang Yu's current cultivation level was now vastly different.

His physical speed, reaction time, Magic Power circulation speed, and mental processing speed were all far greater than before.

Thus, even with the increased cultivation cycles required, Zhang Yu's training speed had actually accelerated. He estimated that he could advance this Body Refinement Technique to Level 30 in just a few days.

Moreover, the "Golden Core Body Refinement Method" had been specifically chosen by Zhang Yu as a component of the "Golden Core Sacred Body" Chain Formation Diagram.

"At my current training speed, I should be able to complete the Golden Core Sacred Body within a month at most."

"Based on the effects of the High School Sacred Body and University Holy Body, the Golden Core Sacred Body should double my cultivation efficiency again..."

Fueled by this realization, Zhang Yu threw himself wholeheartedly into his training.

Meanwhile, a large quantity of body refinement potions, Magic Power potions, and Energy potions suitable for the Golden Core Realm were delivered one after another, gradually depleting Zhang Yu's account balance.

---

While Zhang Yu diligently cultivated, within the Spirit Realm of University City, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sat regally in the main seat, with Director Gao seated beside her. On the other side sat True Monarch Tranquility from the Dao Techniques Department and the former vice-principal, True Monarch Cloud Haven.

"...Given the current situation, the Soul Transformation Certificates will be issued under the authority of True Monarch Greenwood, True Monarch Tranquility, and True Monarch Cloud Haven. Does anyone have any objections?"

The Nascent Soul True Monarchs below nodded silently, none daring to voice dissent against Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's fait accompli.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said coldly, "True Monarch Cloud Haven, please summarize the current situation."

True Monarch Cloud Haven replied solemnly, "Let's begin with the battle on the Fifth Layer."

Images of the sky were projected, revealing the battle scenes unfolding in the Fifth Layer Sky.

"Since the start of the conflict, I've had personnel continuously observe and record the sky. Currently, our forces on the Fifth Layer are in full retreat, completely outmatched by the Finance Department."

Someone exclaimed in shock, "The Fifth Layer houses the research institutes of all the major corporations affiliated with the universities! Even without a Soul Transformation expert present, it's equipped with layers of defenses, cutting-edge magical artifacts and Bionics designed for the upper echelons, and a concentration of elite Nascent Soul cultivators. How could it be so easily overwhelmed?"

True Monarch Cloud Haven said, "What if the Immortal who tore apart Kunxu left Immortal Sect-level technology to the Finance Department, the Demonic Sect, the Evil Gods...?"

The assembled cultivators felt their hearts sink at these words.

True Monarch Cloud Haven continued, "If this Immortal dared to tear apart Kunxu itself, it's not impossible that they would leave behind cultivation arts and technology for their own people. The Fifth Layer's ecosystem may already be undergoing drastic changes due to the emergence of Immortal Sect-level technology."

"Forgive my bluntness, but the Fifth Layer is beyond saving. It's only a matter of time before they attack the Fourth Layer."

"And with the resources they've seized from the Fifth Layer, their advance will only accelerate."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded. "Now, tell us about the situation on the Second Layer."

True Monarch Cloud Haven projected a series of images: towering flames, corpses strewn across the ground, and a crimson sea of blood.

He said gravely, "The battle on the Fifth Layer isn't just visible to us. Anyone in the world who looks up at the sky can see it."

"The appearance of the Blood Moon, combined with the Fifth Layer's complete collapse, has emboldened countless cultivators to attempt unauthorized breakthroughs and commit various illegal acts."

"Without the supervision of the Righteous Gods and lacking oversight from Soul Cultivators, only the Ten Greats and some Upper College officials can maintain order under the Blood Moon."

"In other areas, looting is the best-case scenario. Some High Schools have already suffered massacres. After being invaded, countless Qi Refining students have been subjected to having their tendons severed, bones extracted, souls refined, and spirits plundered..."

True Monarch Cloud Haven said, "Everyone, vast amounts of school assets are vanishing from places we can't see."

"Furthermore, there's the issue of resource consumption in Myriad Laws City."

"Without Righteous Gods, we can temporarily rely on Soul Cultivators, but the cost of governance is skyrocketing."

"Moreover, all external resource nodes have ceased operation. Given Myriad Laws City's population, the number of Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators — especially with the recent surge in newly advanced Golden Core cultivators — daily resource consumption has become even more terrifying than before."

"If we don't receive external supplies soon, our own order will collapse..."

As one piece of bad news followed another, the expressions of those present grew increasingly grim.
