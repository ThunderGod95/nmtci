# Chapter 593: Are You Sure You Want to Choose Her?

Heavenly Sword University.

In the conference room, a short sword resembling a swimming fish floated before Wen Wuya, gliding beneath her gently stroking fingers as if alive.

Wen Wuya tossed her long hair back and glanced at the Spirit Realm Projections of the two figures before her. She spoke calmly, "Our university will send ten participants to the Ten Greats League this year."

"However, based on my assessment, six of them have no chance of contending for the top ranks, let alone first place."

"Therefore, I've only invited three of you here today."

"Zhenzhen has said she won't need the Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword, so we're not counting her. That leaves the three of us — all formidable contenders with varying chances of claiming first place."

"We've gathered today to divide control of the Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword that will hover above the competition arena."

As Wen Wuya spoke, sword light seemed to flicker in her eyes, and more short swords converged around her like a school of fish, circling her from head to toe.

She continued, "The importance of the Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword needs no further explanation. With its assistance, we can assassinate opponents thousands of miles away with ease, bringing the entire competition arena within our detection and attack range."

"Today, I'm proposing a plan for everyone to consider, or rather, to ask for your help."

"To put it bluntly, I want control of the Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword. But to push for first place, I've been spending quite aggressively lately, and I'm short on funds for immediate expenses."

"Here's my proposal: I'll take 70% of the command authority over the Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword, and you two can split the remaining 30%. I'll also give each of you a 100 Spirit Coin subsidy."

One of the student projections scoffed, "Wen Wuya, if you hog 70% of the command authority, how are we supposed to compete with you? At that point, what's the difference between your 70% and 100%? You think you can buy complete control of the Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword for just 200 Spirit Coins? Do you even deserve to be a Soul Transformation disciple?"

Another student projection chimed in, "Exactly! Using your Soul Transformation status to pressure us is pathetic. If you've got the guts, crush us with money!"

Wen Wuya smiled faintly. "Very well," she said. "I'll offer more. 300 Spirit Coins — is that enough?"

The other student scoffed again. "Don't even think about it..."

In the next moment, the two student projections before Wen Wuya trembled violently as frantic alarms blared from their Bionic Eyes. At their true locations, every inch of their Bionics had been directly locked onto.

Simultaneously, an icy chill enveloped their minds, and their dao hearts began pounding fiercely with urgent warnings.

With this lock-on, the swarm of flying swords around Wen Wuya stirred slightly. In the next instant, they swiveled in unison, their tips aimed directly at the students' positions.

Though observing the flying swords' movements through the Spirit Realm, the students felt each blade was aimed at them, as if pressed against their necks, ready to strike at any moment.

"Wen Wuya! You've locked onto us with the Sky-Patrolling Flying Swords?!"

"Wen Wuya! What do you think you're doing?!"

Watching their mingled shock and fury, Wen Wuya said calmly, "The Sky-Patrolling Flying Swords were meticulously crafted, piece by piece, by my Master and Heavenly Sword University. As his personal disciple, am I not entitled to use them?"

"I've called you here today not to demand something from you, but to share a portion of my command authority."

After ending the call, Wen Wuya closed her eyes, feeling her consciousness ascend, instantly traversing thousands of meters. From this elevated vantage point, she surveyed the entirety of Heavenly Sword University, absorbing every detail — the diverse architecture, flying boats, and bustling crowds.

"This battle will determine the ownership of the Immortal Sect-level Technique."

"Immortal Sect-level Technique..."

The mere mention of the Immortal Sect-level Technique conjured a series of astonishing Immortal Dao Technologies in Wen Wuya's mind:

Mind sensing, spatial manipulation, precognition, thought modification, memory weaving, cultivation devouring, hyperspace-speed flying swords, temporal stasis...

If not for her Master's recent guidance, Wen Wuya would never have realized the sheer terror of the Immortal Dao Technologies wielded by the Ten Great Sects.

"The Immortal Sect-level Technique isn't merely a matter of power, profundity, or mystery."

Wen Wuya thought to himself, "The reason the Ten Great Sects have always monopolized these techniques is because they contain Immortal Dao Technology capable of revolutionizing the lower realms of Kunxu."

"Even the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, who were granted Immortal Sect-level cultivation arts in the past, received specially selected techniques. Though powerful, their societal impact was carefully controlled within predetermined boundaries."

"But this Immortal Sect Technique Self-Selection..."

Wen Wuya took a deep breath. Even now, empowered by the Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword, his vision penetrating all corners of the world like reading lines on a palm, he felt no sense of reassurance.

"The university that acquires the  Immortal Sect Technique this time will spearhead the transformation of Kunxu's lower realms."

"And the Immortals who made this decision..."

A conjecture surged in Wen Wuya's mind.

"Their willingness to release an Immortal Sect-level cultivation art like this... does it mean they've made another breakthrough in Immortal Dao Technology?"

At this thought, Wen Wuya's vital energy and Magic Power couldn't help but stir slightly.

"Whether we'll be crushed by the torrent of the era or stand at the crest of the wave, guiding the age forward... this battle will decide it all."

Just as Wen Wuya was assigning command of the Sky-Patrolling Flying Swords for the Ten Greats League, Bai Zhenzhen arrived at a massive treasure vault in another corner of Heavenly Sword University.

Before her lay rows of flying swords, each uniquely shaped and sized, yet all radiating intense Sword Intent. Gazing at the dazzling array of blades, Bai Zhenzhen's eyes widened in surprise.

"These are all..."

"...my senior brothers and sisters?"

Her gaze swept across the sword bodies. Upon closer inspection, faint humanoid shapes seemed to materialize within the metal, while some swords pulsed rhythmically, like living hearts, radiating a palpable vitality.

The voice of Divine Monarch Seven Emotions echoed in her ear: "Indeed."

"Throughout my life, I have devoted myself to teaching disciples and transmitting the Sword Dao, hoping that someone would carry on the legacy of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao after my demise."

"Alas, among the thousands of disciples I have trained, only you have survived practicing the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao to this day."

"For this Ten Greats League, choose a senior master to accompany you."

After a moment of silence, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but ask, "Master, is it possible... I mean, just possible... that the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is flawed?"

"Absolutely impossible," Divine Monarch Seven Emotions declared emphatically. "The Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is not flawed. If there's any fault, it lies in our own incorrect practice and transmission of the technique."

After a long silence, as if pondering something deeply, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions slowly said, "Long ago... the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao was originally an Immortal Sect-level Technique."

Bai Zhenzhen gasped, "An Immortal Sect-level Technique?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions explained, "Only by reaching the extreme of emotion can one reach the extreme of the sword. As emotion is boundless, so too is the sword. The Extreme Emotion Sword Dao uses emotional intensity to drive Sword Intent, transcending the material world and elevating the spirit above matter. It's an unparalleled sword technique created by the Extreme Emotion Sword Immortal of the Heavenly Sword Sect, an Immortal Sect-level Technique."

"However, by the time this technique reached me, it had already been downgraded to military-grade."

"My greatest desires in this life are twofold: first, to ensure the continuation of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, and second, to one day restore this sword technique to its original Immortal Sect-level glory."

"This time, if you can secure first place in the Ten Greats League..."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions paused slightly before continuing, "You may choose another cultivation art from the Extreme Emotion Sword Immortal. Perhaps it can compensate for the current deficiencies in the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded. "Master..."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said calmly, "However, claiming first place won't be easy, especially since the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao eschews external tools. Your chances are slim unless you can overcome the Emotional Tribulation and advance the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao to Level 20. Only then will you stand a chance."

"Alright, make your choice quickly. Select a master who resonates with your heart, then depart. Do not disturb their eternal slumber."

Bai Zhenzhen walked among the flying swords, her thoughts churning.

Originally, she had striven to cultivate diligently, aiming for a strong performance in the Ten Greats League, hoping one day to break free from the Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' control and resume her pursuit of the Immortal Dao alongside Zhang Yu.

But imperceptibly, she had truly become a successor of the Extreme Emotion Immortal Dao. Her relationship with Zhang Yu had undergone a profound transformation, and the Ten Greats League had gradually taken on a significance far beyond its initial meaning.

When Bai Zhenzhen first arrived at Heavenly Sword University, she had eagerly anticipated the day she would reunite with Zhang Yu.

But now, she dreaded the prospect of seeing him again. She feared accidentally harming him, even killing him, and losing him as a friend forever.

Relying on her Divine Spiritual Root and innate talent to gradually perfect the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao... she lacked confidence in her prospects.

Bai Zhenzhen sought to claim the first place in the Ten Greats League, master the other cultivation arts of the Extreme Emotion Sword Immortal, and rectify the flaws of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao.

"If I achieve that, I won't have to worry about hurting Yu Zi, right?"

As Bai Zhenzhen's fighting spirit gradually surged, the surrounding flying swords seemed to sense her resolve, trembling in unison.

Among them, one sword stood out — the most ferocious, wild, and malevolent of them all — as if constantly beckoning her, relentlessly drawing her gaze.

Sensing Bai Zhenzhen's unspoken question, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions replied calmly, "Your senior sister, Wu Hui."

"Before her death, she slaughtered her entire clan, slaying her father, mother, husband, and children, massacring all within the Nine Clans..."

Yet Bai Zhenzhen bypassed the malevolent sword and approached another, one radiating serene tranquility, utterly devoid of any battle intent.

"Master, I wish to choose her."

A hint of surprise colored Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' voice as she said, "Her?"

Bai Zhenzhen asked, "Is that not allowed?"

The Divine Monarch replied, "She... is not my disciple."

Bai Zhenzhen exclaimed in surprise, "Ah?"

"She is the only person in this treasure vault who does not belong to our sect," the Divine Monarch explained. "Are you certain you wish to choose her?"
