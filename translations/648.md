# Chapter 648: Kuang Tianqing's Rebirth

"How is this possible?!"

Ye Xingli, who was live-streaming the battle to her fans, abruptly widened her eyes, staring at the battlefield in utter disbelief.

"Kuang Tianqing... she actually failed to evade Bai Zhenzhen's sword?"

Meanwhile, at Heavenly Sword University's encampment, Wen Wuya watched the scene with equal shock. "Something's wrong, terribly wrong. How could Kuang Tianqing fail to block even a single strike?"

Recalling Kuang Tianqing's earlier outburst, Wen Wuya thought to himself, "Could it be... could she also be...?"

As the thought crossed his mind, Wen Wuya instinctively rubbed his temples.

On the battlefield, Bai Zhenzhen was equally surprised by this turn of events. She hadn't expected her flying sword to pierce Kuang Tianqing's body so quickly.

"Did Kuang Tianqing make a mistake?"

"What just happened?"

"Is this a trap?"

In a split-second, Bai Zhenzhen seized the opportunity, channeling more sword qi to twist her flying sword within the wound, aiming to widen the damage.

But the next moment, Bai Zhenzhen's gaze sharpened as she realized her flying sword had lost its connection to her.

At that moment, Kuang Tianqing raised her arm, and Bai Zhenzhen's flying sword pierced through her palm and extended all the way to her elbow.

In that critical instant, despite her mind being in chaos, Kuang Tianqing reacted instinctively, using her arm to block Bai Zhenzhen's sword.

By sacrificing her arm, she avoided the far more severe consequence of a direct strike to the head.

After leaving the flying sword embedded in her arm, Kuang Tianqing forcibly injected a surge of polluted spiritual energy into the blade.

Activating the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique, she forcibly severed the sword's detection module, severing its connection to Bai Zhenzhen.

Watching this unfold, Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, "The Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique has such applications? I must prevent her from injecting spiritual energy and absolutely avoid letting her capture my flying sword..."

While pondering this, Bai Zhenzhen drew the Yuhuan Sword, refined by the daughter of Divine Monarch Seven Emotions.

Originally, she had intended to use this military-grade flying sword only in the most critical moments.

But the battlefield's ever-shifting dynamics had suddenly presented what she considered a crucial opportunity.

"Whether Kuang Tianqing made a mistake or succumbed to demonic possession, it doesn't matter."

"This is my best chance to defeat her."

"I must seize this opportunity and strike with maximum speed..."

As the electric grid above intensified, Bai Zhenzhen, wielding the Yuhuan Sword, flashed through the air, closing the distance to Kuang Tianqing in a series of swift movements.

Zhang Yu's memories...

Kuang Tianqing's humiliation...

That sliver of dawn over Songyang City's First Layer...

Intense emotions erupted from Bai Zhenzhen's heart, coalescing into streams of black sword qi that surged into the Yuhuan Sword. With an aura of annihilation, she slashed at Kuang Tianqing.

*Clang!*

Bai Zhenzhen was startled. "What? She's blocking my strike with her arm — the one pierced by the flying sword?"

Kuang Tianqing thought grimly, "Tch, your own flying sword should have some resistance to the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, right? Perfect for a temporary block."

Simultaneously, Kuang Tianqing roared inwardly, "And you! Get out of my head now!"

In the blink of an eye, the battle had already progressed beyond ten exchanges.

Though Kuang Tianqing initially faced perilous moments, as she suppressed the unfamiliar memories flooding her mind, she gradually began to unleash a portion of her true strength.

Even so, facing Bai Zhenzhen's full-throttle assault came at a cost.

With a soft *splatter*, the arm pierced by the flying sword fell to the ground.

Kuang Tianqing now stood disarmed, her left arm severed by Bai Zhenzhen's blade.

"There's a chance," Bai Zhenzhen thought, her battle spirit soaring higher with each strike. "Although I don't know why, Kuang Tianqing's strength has plummeted. I have a chance to defeat her."

In the next moment, her black sword qi missed its target again.

Watching Kuang Tianqing gradually dissolve into a shadow, Bai Zhenzhen wondered, "Is she using the Heavenly Demon Void Technique again? Has her strength recovered?"

"But it's not over yet!"

The black sword qi pierced through Kuang Tianqing's body, but instead of dissipating, it was channeled into the strands of hair behind her.

Kuang Tianqing was momentarily stunned. "This woman... her hair, spread across the battlefield, not only stores her Magic Power and forms an electric field to accelerate her attacks, but also acts as a sword artifact, guiding her black sword qi."

Frowning, Kuang Tianqing watched as the black sword qi passed through her body, was absorbed into the swirling hair, and then, guided by the strands, shot back at her with renewed force.

She felt like she was trapped in a sealed room filled with ping-pong balls. The black sword qi, like countless tiny spheres, ricocheted off the walls at high speed, repeatedly piercing her body.

"Kuang Tianqing!" Bai Zhenzhen relentlessly attacked, attacked, and attacked again. A tidal wave of black sword qi surged forth, each strike aimed at Kuang Tianqing.

"How much longer can your ethereal form hold? The more you resist, the stronger my Sword Intent grows!"

"Keep enduring. The moment you falter will be my moment of victory."

Meanwhile, Kuang Tianqing swiftly made her own judgment: "I can't drag this out. The longer it goes on, the more complicated it will become."

"And this body..."

As the mad voices in her mind raged and the onslaught of unfamiliar memories crashed through her consciousness, Kuang Tianqing felt waves of agony and fury surging within her, which she forcefully suppressed.

She knew this pain was unwarranted.

She knew she should focus solely on the match before her.

She knew she should fight with all her might.

But she just... couldn't help it.

"Why has this world become like this?"

"Why? Why must I, the dignified... give birth?!"

Torn by the conflicting thoughts flooding her mind, Kuang Tianqing made her final, agonizing decision: "I have no choice but to temporarily abandon this body."

In an instant, Kuang Tianqing's ethereal form solidified, and she was immediately engulfed by the countless streams of sword qi surging from all directions.

The next moment, a wailing cry erupted as Kuang Tianqing spat out a tiny body.

Bai Zhenzhen's gaze sharpened. "A Demonic Fetus?" she thought.

"No, she was already pregnant. This is Kuang Tianqing's backup body, prepared long ago?"

Simultaneously, the tiny body rapidly grew, visibly expanding before their eyes.

Engulfed in sword qi, Kuang Tianqing roared furiously and launched a frenzied attack on Bai Zhenzhen.

At the same time, Kuang Tianqing's original body screamed, "Demonic Dao fiends! Die, all of you — "

But her words abruptly ceased, as if she had completely lost her mind, fighting purely on instinct.

Watching this unfold, Kuang Tianqing thought, "Hmph, those Reincarnation Group bastards! They injected past-life memories into my mind, hoping the clash between ancient and modern thoughts would weaken my combat power."

"But I left those memories in my original body. Fearing exposure, they must have proactively erased them again."

"For the immediate future, she likely won't make any more moves."

While Bai Zhenzhen was fending off the frenzied attacks of Kuang Tianqing's original body, Kuang Tianqing's new body had rapidly matured into a teenager.

With a thunderous crash, Bai Zhenzhen sent Kuang Tianqing's original body flying. Reduced to pure instinct, the original body paused its assault, then lapsed into a dazed stupor.

Controlling the teenage body, Kuang Tianqing grinned at Bai Zhenzhen. "Now, let's have some fun with this body. This might be your best chance to win — make the most of it."

Bai Zhenzhen's gaze sharpened. "A newly formed body, lacking the support of her Bionics... this is indeed a perfect opportunity to defeat her."

Yet Bai Zhenzhen didn't rush to attack. The reborn Kuang Tianqing was clearly no longer berserk, showing none of the frenzied behavior she had exhibited moments ago.

Bai Zhenzhen meticulously adjusted her mental and physical state, preparing to seize this opportunity with her strongest strike.

Her first move was to slash her own body with her sword.

"Hmm?" Kuang Tianqing, observing the scene, was momentarily stunned. Sensing the shift in Bai Zhenzhen's aura, she suddenly realized, "She's using the Seven Emotions Sword Dao to sever her own emotions."

"Anger, hatred, sorrow, grief..."

Kuang Tianqing thought, "She's systematically cutting away all negative emotions."

Simultaneously, the smile on Bai Zhenzhen's face grew increasingly intense, as if only one emotion remained, one singular feeling.

"Yu Zi..."

Overwhelming emotion surged through her mind, becoming the perfect nourishment for the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao.

"I will claim first place and perfect the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"I will defeat Kuang Tianqing and utterly crush her humiliation of Zhang Yu and me."

"I..."

As the Seven Emotions Sword Dao adjusted, intense malice and killing intent resurfaced.

Kuang Tianqing thought, "First, she severed her negative emotions, using pure love — extreme love, overwhelmingly intense love — to fuel the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao. Then, she withdrew the sword qi, giving birth to the most extreme negative emotions, and unleashed the most vicious, all-annihilating Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"But if she wants to advance further, she must completely sever all positive emotions and love from her heart, leaving only pure destruction..."

A tear welled in Bai Zhenzhen's eye, only to be shattered by sword qi a moment later. Before severing her emotions, waves of intense reluctance surged through her heart.

"Yu Zi, I must say goodbye for now."

"I want to be with you forever."

"I want us to always be best friends."

"I never want to hurt you..."

With another strike of Seven Emotions Sword Qi, all affection vanished from Bai Zhenzhen's eyes, replaced by an aura of absolute destruction.

Memories of the past faded into monochrome: her high school days with Zhang Yu, the first time they exchanged Spiritual Roots, their university life together... all seemed like black-and-white images, devoid of warmth or appeal.

Now, she only craved to annihilate Kuang Tianqing with overwhelming power, terrifying destructive force, and insane speed.

Silently, Bai Zhenzhen materialized before Kuang Tianqing and swung her sword down in a lethal strike.

Kuang Tianqing attempted to retaliate, but suddenly discovered that Bai Zhenzhen's sword had plunged all tangible and intangible aspects of her being: spiritual energy, Magic Power, Gang Qi, vital energy... into a state of inertia, rendering them sluggish, unresponsive, and trapped in a deathly stillness.

Boom!

Bai Zhenzhen's right arm shattered violently, while Kuang Tianqing's new body dissolved into a cloud of blood mist that dispersed into the atmosphere.

Yet in the next instant, Kuang Tianqing's original form snapped open its eyes, thinking to itself, "What a terrifying strike! Even she can't sustain that, can she? Fortunately, I used the backup body to divert it..."

Just as Kuang Tianqing finished this thought, Bai Zhenzhen's figure materialized directly before her.

"It's a pity. Your first strike was already your peak."

"After that strike, you expended too much energy. This strike is no longer at its peak."

As Bai Zhenzhen slashed down with her sword again, Kuang Tianqing, having regained complete control of her body, pointed a finger. The radiant glow of her shattered Golden Core began to illuminate her fingertip.

"You are worthy of receiving this technique."

The blinding light engulfed both figures.

When the radiance subsided, Kuang Tianqing stood with her arms crossed, calmly observing Bai Zhenzhen, who knelt nearby. "You have the strength for one final strike," she said.

"I will wait."

"As the strongest opponent I've faced in a one-on-one battle, this is the respect Kuang Tianqing grants you."

Wen Wuya, who was also watching the scene, was slightly taken aback. He thought to himself, "Is Kuang Tianqing really this kind of person?"

"She has ultimately been influenced."
