# Chapter 632: Livestream, Conversation, and War

Zhang Yu had to admit Ye Xingli was right, so he simply started livestreaming from the Spirit Hall.

In his mind, the Four-Headed White Bull roared incessantly. He split off a thread of consciousness to continue practicing his cultivation art while simultaneously launching the livestream.

As soon as the stream went live, a torrent of insults flooded his Bionic Eye's display.

This didn't surprise Zhang Yu in the slightest. Ever since he'd been accused of discriminating against monsterfolk, he'd faced a daily barrage of abuse from monsters in the Spirit Realm.

After his battle with Ling Pojun, the number of insults had only increased, fueled by Extreme Tiger fans.

If anyone in the Spirit Realm was paying close attention to him, it was undoubtedly these monsterfolk and Extreme Tiger fans.

The moment Zhang Yu went live, they swarmed into the livestream, unleashing a torrent of abusive comments.

Zhang Yu had grown accustomed to the insults and paid them little mind.

What bothered him was that simply being insulted wasn't profitable or conducive to cultivation.

He voiced his concerns to Ye Xingli, who replied, "Don't rush. The hype isn't high enough yet. I'll connect with you in ten minutes."

Ye Xingli: "I have tons of Vocational College fans. They'll definitely be interested in you."

Zhang Yu: "Aren't most Vocational College students Extreme Tiger fans?"

Ye Xingli: "Extreme Tiger fans are still fans."

Ten minutes later, as Zhang Yu and Ye Xingli connected their streams, he immediately felt the number of viewers in his livestream skyrocket more than tenfold. An ever-growing flood of Junior College Students poured into his channel, all eager to hurl insults at him.

Though occasional tips trickled in, they were paltry sums like 0.001 Spirit Coins or 0.0001 Spirit Coins. To Zhang Yu, even hauling bricks would earn him more.

Zhang Yu: Senior Sister, what's the next step?

Ye Xingli: Let's try enabling voice chat first.

Ye Xingli: 0.1 Spirit Coins for one minute of voice chat.

Zhang Yu activated the feature, and instantly, a stream of voice chat requests flooded his Bionic Eye.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Damn these Junior College Students. If they have money for this, why aren't they studying or cultivating properly? No wonder they're stuck in Vocational College."

Accepting the first request, he heard a slightly nervous voice: "Zhang Yu! I demand to know why you look down on Extreme Tiger?"

Zhang Yu asked, "Are you a Junior College Student?"

The voice replied, "What does my school have to do with this?"

Zhang Yu retorted, "Because Extreme Tiger's largest user base is Junior College Students. It's specifically designed for you guys — cheap, clunky, full of bugs, and starts lagging after a year."

"I need to tell everyone: University students, never buy Extreme Tiger! For magical artifacts and Bionics, go to Myriad Paths Artisan Sect. For Magic Power, use Magic Power Treasure. For Spirit Realm services, use Hammerheart Pavilion. Everything else is garbage..."

As Zhang Yu finished speaking, the livestream chat erupted in fury. Watching the screen fill with insults, Zhang Yu calmly accepted the next video call.

The second caller immediately spat out "Scumbag!" followed by a torrent of curses interspersed with animalistic roars, making Zhang Yu frown repeatedly.

"Monsterfolk?" Zhang Yu asked.

The caller continued their furious tirade.

"You're an Extreme Tiger Monster, aren't you?" Zhang Yu pressed.

The caller paused, then snarled, "Bullshit! What's the difference between Extreme Tiger and non-Extreme Tiger monsterfolk?"

"Where do you live?" Zhang Yu asked.

"Shuizhou Monsterfolk Vocational Academy," the caller replied.

"Confirmed: Extreme Tiger Monster," Zhang Yu stated.

As Zhang Yu continued taking calls, the livestream's popularity surged again. Even the monsterfolk and Extreme Tiger fans, who had initially united in their criticism of Zhang Yu, began arguing among themselves.

At that moment, Zhang Yu noticed a series of comments and said, "Tian Shengong from Immortal Armaments University? You say he's very dissatisfied with me and wants to call in?"

"I don't see Tian Shengong trying to call me."

"If he wants to call, tell him to come himself."

As the livestream's popularity surged, another person connected and immediately began reciting martial arts incantations.

However, the stream was automatically shut down after only half a sentence.

Zhang Yu shook his head at the 24-hour ban notification. "These guys are such sore losers, aren't they?"

Though the livestream was suspended, Zhang Yu still received sporadic transaction requests, such as offers to pay him to record customized insult videos.

There were also requests for summoning services, hoping to summon his remote projection to deliver mental strikes and spiritual pressure.

"Insult videos are fine, but remote summoning? No way. I don't have that kind of time."

"Hmm? You want me to talk about the 'Local' brand?"

While similar to Extreme Tiger's positioning, Zhang Yu naturally wouldn't provoke the "Local" brand, especially since the company was affiliated with Myriad Laws University.

Through occasional livestreams and insult videos, Zhang Yu surprisingly earned 70 to 80 Spirit Coins daily, boosting his popularity and replenishing his account balance.

Even his next advertisement fee had risen from 70 to 90 Spirit Coins.

By the night before his second battle, after relentless cultivation, Zhang Yu finally advanced the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture to Level 20.

At that moment, Zhang Yu felt that he could summon four monsterfolk avatars at any time, controlling them as extensions of his own body.

Among these selectable avatars, aquatic creatures predominated.

This was because, to complement the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, Zhang Yu had been primarily acquiring Monster Blood from various aquatic monsterfolk species.

Whether using the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture or the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, breeding monsterfolk or Demon Beasts required selecting specific Monster Blood. Extracting Fish Monster blood would only produce Fish Monsters, not Lion Monsters, Ox Monsters, or other types.

Just as Zhang Yu finished his cultivation session, True Monarch Tranquility contacted him.

True Monarch Tranquility: Zhang Yu, your next opponent is Ying Mingchi. After careful analysis, the school believes your chances of winning are slim.

True Monarch Tranquility: We hope you'll consider supporting your teammates in the subsequent matches.

True Monarch Tranquility: Someone will come to discuss the specifics with you later.

Zhang Yu frowned, pondering briefly before a familiar figure entered the Spirit Hall.

"Nine Heavens Liu?" Zhang Yu asked, recognizing the newcomer. "Are you here to see Brother Dao?"

Nine Heavens Liu shook his head. "Brother Dao is already gone. I'm here to see you, Zhang Yu."

Zhang Yu's gaze flickered slightly. "To see me?"

Zhang Yu couldn't think of any connection between himself and Nine Heavens Liu, aside from having rejected his recruitment offer to the Finance Department and having surpassed him in the relay race. There was no personal relationship between them.

His mind immediately recalled the message True Monarch Tranquility had just sent. Nine Heavens Liu said, "You're fighting Ying Mingchi tomorrow, right? I need you to gather some intelligence for me."

As Zhang Yu reviewed the battle plan Nine Heavens Liu had sent, he instantly understood.

His Bionic Eye projected the tournament bracket, highlighting Ying Mingchi and Nine Heavens Liu's positions.

"If Nine Heavens Liu defeats his opponent and Ying Mingchi defeats me, they'll face each other next."

"This battle plan assumes my defeat and focuses on gathering as much intelligence on Ying Mingchi as possible to support Nine Heavens Liu's subsequent fight against him."

Zhang Yu looked at Nine Heavens Liu and asked, "You're aiming for the championship too?"

Nine Heavens Liu replied solemnly, "Why shouldn't I? Brother Dao is dead. I'm now the strongest fighter at Myriad Laws University. And my strength has always been on par with the top fighters from other schools."

"If the school is willing to provide more support, I'm not without a chance of defeating Kuang Tianqing."

"After all, Kuang Tianqing is merely at the Foundation Establishment stage."

"Zhang Yu..." Nine Heavens Liu gazed at Zhang Yu with sincere goodwill. "You were willing to help Brother Dao ascend the throne. You could help me do the same, and I would share the profits with you."

As he spoke, he looked at Zhang Yu with genuine sincerity, as if all past conflicts and animosities had been completely forgotten.

Zhang Yu had no interest in helping Nine Heavens Liu win the championship. In fact, after defeating Ying Mingchi, Nine Heavens Liu was his next opponent.

Therefore, Zhang Yu was very curious about Nine Heavens Liu's intelligence and confidence.

Zhang Yu replied, "The entire world is now on Kuang Tianqing's side. She's fighting for the people's chance at extended lifespans, and she has overwhelming support. Who could possibly challenge her?"

Nine Heavens Liu sneered. "Everyone claims to be fighting for the people. Would they ever admit they're doing it for themselves? No matter how noble Kuang Tianqing's words sound, her ultimate goal is simply to represent the interests of the Four Heavenly Demon Schools and use the lifespan extension technology to control the world."

"Even if we need to extend our lifespans, we should be the ones developing the technology and selling it to them, not begging them to sell it to us."

"The difference between these two scenarios is as vast as the heavens and the earth."

Zhang Yu asked, "Are the Soul Transformation cultivators at our university also interested in extending their lifespans?"

Nine Heavens Liu replied coolly, "Who wouldn't want to live a few more years? But Kuang Tianqing's talk about universal lifespan extension? It's just a scam to fool the poor."

"A scam?" Zhang Yu asked.

Nine Heavens Liu snorted. "If the sect's technology is so advanced, why do people still die?"

"When lifespan becomes a commodity, it can rise as quickly as it falls."

"Zhang Yu, don't expect to live longer just because Kuang Tianqing wins first place. In the end, you, I, and everyone at Myriad Laws University will only become poorer. The Soul Transformation cultivators might gain a few extra years, but our lifespans will likely be even shorter than before."

"We'll either be harvested by the Four Heavenly Demon Schools or harvest them ourselves. Those are the only two possible outcomes of this Ten Greats League."

Zhang Yu nodded. "I can help you."

"But I have my own conditions."

Nine Heavens Liu smiled confidently. "State them."

The next day, after a week had passed, the second round of the arena battles officially began.

The fourteen contestants soared into the sky, enveloped in divine light, and were transported to battlefields scattered across the floating islands.

Only Kuang Tianqing remained behind, having drawn a bye for this round.

Watching Kuang Tianqing's solitary figure, Zhang Yu mused, "Come to think of it, this tournament schedule was arranged by the Heavenly Court, wasn't it? I wonder if the draws were truly random..."

Just then, a dragon's roar echoed from nearby.

Zhang Yu looked up and saw Ying Mingchi, enveloped in divine power, plummeting toward a snow-covered plain alongside him.

The atmosphere trembled violently as the two descended, erupting in thunderous booms.

*Boom!*

Amidst the explosive crash, Zhang Yu landed firmly in a massive crater.

As he raised his head, he saw a colossal dragon shadow blotting out the sky, bringing with it a storm of dark clouds that pressed down like a suffocating weight.
