# Chapter 774: New Group Leader, What About the Old One?

"It's only natural for there to be shady dealings," Immortal Slayer said with a laugh. "The Edict Pavilion controls the approval of all cultivation arts in the Myriad Laws Sect. Can you imagine the immense profits involved?"

He continued, "Which cultivation arts get rejected, which get fast-tracked, and which get buried in paperwork... it's all about schemes and profits."

Zhang Yu sighed. "It seems there are plenty of shady dealings within the sect as well."

Immortal Slayer snorted. "How could sect members possibly abide by the law like Lower Realm Natives? That's just how Kunxu is. The lower you are, the more you follow the rules. The higher you climb, the less you follow them, and the less you're bound by the Heavenly Court."

"The so-called laws are merely tools to uphold Dao Lineages and restrict others, not to restrain oneself."

Immortal Slayer sneered. "You want to talk about abiding by the law in a sect? I almost want to laugh. Here, there are only struggles for Dao Lineages and profits. There's never been any concept of 'lawful' or 'unlawful,' 'righteous' or 'evil.'"

He let out a soft sigh. "There is no Demonic Dao, nor is there a Righteous Path. There are only insatiably greedy, utterly selfish people."

Zhang Yu shook his head and turned his attention back to the review report before him.

Sensing their disillusioned expressions, Lady Fortune cursed inwardly, "Damn it, these two resonate with each other way too easily!"

"It used to be my line in moments like this! I was always the one guiding Zhang Yu! But now, this Immortal Slayer is always rushing to mentor him instead."

"How can I let this guy keep seizing the initiative?"

Lady Fortune racked her brain, trying to come up with something profound, philosophical, and relevant to Zhang Yu's current topic.

But the harder she thought, the more her mind went blank.

To her, the sect's situation they were discussing was perfectly normal. What was there to sigh about?

"Hmph! This Immortal Slayer is practically half a Zhang Yu. When he guides Zhang Yu, he's just guiding himself. Even a master conversationalist like me can't possibly compete with him."

After struggling for a long time, Lady Fortune finally managed to say, "Indeed."

Ignoring Lady Fortune's agreement, Zhang Yu continued flipping through the report. He was now examining the review report submitted by Xiao Zhi, the Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One.

He had chosen Xiao Zhi because the man had caused quite a stir after joining the Deliberation Group, displaying obvious hostility that had drawn Zhang Yu's attention.

Upon closer inspection, Zhang Yu discovered something fishy.

"Some of the cultivation arts Xiao Zhi rejected... in my opinion, the justifications were insufficient, even careless."

Zhang Yu mentally simulated the cultivation arts and sensed even more discrepancies.

"If I had been the one making the judgment at the time, I would have deemed these arts worthy of approval. They shouldn't have been rejected."

He pulled out other reports and added, "And... similar cultivation arts were approved later."

Lady Fortune's eyes lit up. "Zhang Yu, are you saying Xiao Zhi deliberately rejected some cultivation arts and then sold their Immortal Dao secrets to others?"

Zhang Yu replied, "It's a possibility."

"With my abilities, I can collect and test each of these cultivation arts, then compile the findings into a report. That would be enough to prove his rejections were highly unreasonable."

Lady Fortune nodded repeatedly. She knew this wasn't just because Zhang Yu's professional skills were top-notch, but also because his solitary, correct judgment on the Spirit Refining Art had demonstrated his exceptional discernment in cultivation art review to everyone.

Lady Fortune said, "As you are now... if you submit this evidence, no one in the Review Department can afford to ignore it."

"If we coordinate with the applicants whose cultivation arts were rejected and report him together, we might be able to drag Xiao Zhi down from his position as Group Leader."

Lady Fortune said excitedly, "If Xiao Zhi is really corrupt, Lu Hengzhang, who oversees the Martial Dao, would be held directly responsible. That would ruin his chances of becoming Minister, right? Are you going to report him?"

Immortal Slayer cautioned, "We shouldn't report him ourselves. The pressure would be too great. We just need to hand the compiled evidence to someone else, and they'll naturally take action."

Zhang Yu asked, "But the question is... who do we give it to?"

Lady Fortune suggested, "Luo Wuji? If it's him, he could probably use it to take down Lu Hengzhang, right?"

"Or maybe we give it to Lu Hengzhang himself? If he's aiming for the Minister's position, he'd be terrified of any negative incidents leaking out, wouldn't he?"

"What about that Gu Qingya? He's a Deputy Minister too, isn't he? Does he have a chance at becoming Minister?"

Lady Fortune rattled off all the leaders Zhang Yu currently knew, feeling that each option had its pros and cons. For a moment, she couldn't decide who would be the best choice.

Zhang Yu turned to Immortal Slayer. "Immortal Slayer, what do you think?"

Immortal Slayer replied, "Let's ask for advice. Starfire and Zhang Pianpian should be able to provide useful suggestions."

Zhang Yu's eyes flickered. "Elder Sister and Teacher Starfire?"

Immortal Slayer explained, "Starfire has spent years navigating the sect's lower levels. His understanding of its intricate politics is deeper than mine."

"Zhang Pianpian, on the other hand, can help you gather more information from the perspective of the Divine Dao."

"We know too little about these three individuals right now. With insufficient information, we're at a disadvantage. Making a choice under these circumstances would be nothing more than a gamble."

Zhang Yu felt Immortal Slayer's advice was sound. "That makes sense," he thought. "After all, he inherited my memories. How could his advice be illogical?"

"Even if he hadn't suggested it, I probably would have ended up doing the same thing."

So, Zhang Yu sent messages to both of them, briefly describing his current predicament.

Soon, True Monarch Starfire contacted Zhang Yu.

But as the projection materialized before him, Zhang Yu could only think... "Who is this handsome guy?"

If the True Monarch Starfire Zhang Yu had met in the Lower Realm was like a withered tree, constantly exuding an aura of deathly stillness and oppressive gloom...

...then the new True Monarch Starfire before him looked like a young man in his twenties. Not only did he radiate vibrant vitality, but his eyes shone with sharp brilliance, projecting an air of spirited ambition.

All of this served as a stark reminder to everyone: the figure before them was not a 350-year-old Golden Core cultivator, but a 350-year-old new Nascent Soul cultivator.

At the same time, True Monarch Starfire seemed to be speaking to someone on the other side of the Dharma Realm. "Which position in this mission is the most dangerous? Good. I'll take that one."

"Don't send anyone to protect me. I thrive on danger."

After finishing, True Monarch Starfire turned back to Zhang Yu and smiled. "It's only been a little over a month, and you've already gotten yourself tangled up in so much trouble?"

Zhang Yu asked, "Teacher Starfire, what do you think I should do?"

True Monarch Starfire spoke eloquently, "When choosing sides in the sect, the first step is to organize information, especially by understanding the prevailing trends of each faction."

"The key to information lies in Dao Lineages."

"A cultivator's actions and demeanor will, to some extent, always align with the Dao Lineage they support. The more powerful the cultivator, the more this holds true."

"You need to first figure out which Dao Lineages your superiors are backed by. Identify which ones will conflict with you, which ones will benefit you, or... at the very least, which ones are harmless..."

After offering some advice about Dao Lineages, True Monarch Starfire turned to specific individuals. "Tell me about Luo Wuji, the Minister of your Review Department. Theoretically, this top leader should be your first choice..."

After listening, True Monarch Starfire sighed. "With this Spirit Refining Art incident, you've thoroughly slapped him in the face."

"In the sect, face is paramount," True Monarch Starfire said with a smile. "After all, face is an extension of authority. By slapping his face, you've diminished his authority and caused him a loss. If he remains the top leader, he will inevitably try to get it back from you."

Zhang Yu's eyes flickered. "So, it's actually a good thing that he might not remain Minister?"

True Monarch Starfire nodded. "Besides, what you have won't help him retain his position. So, this Luo Wuji is not a good choice."

Next, True Monarch Starfire asked about Lu Hengzhang and Gu Qingya, but unfortunately, Zhang Yu didn't know much about them either.

True Monarch Starfire sighed. "The actions of those two are likely tied to their Dao Lineages. If only we knew which side they're on."

Zhang Yu understood that for a cultivator who had reached the Void Refinement Realm and established their own laws, one could roughly determine their Dao Lineage allegiance simply by examining the content of those laws.

However, for Soul Transformation Realm cultivators like Lu Hengzhang and Gu Qingya, such a simple judgment wasn't possible.

Just then, a message from Zhang Pianpian appeared in Zhang Yu's vision.

Zhang Pianpian: "Meet me at the old place."

A moment later, Zhang Yu found himself once again in the Supreme Clarity Realm.

Seeing Zhang Pianpian after so long, Zhang Yu exclaimed happily, "Sis!"

Zhang Yu had tried to contact her during this time, but she seemed constantly busy, and her replies had always been sporadic.

Now, Zhang Pianpian looked at him and said, "Within the Dharma Realm, surveillance of Righteous Gods, divine power, and talismans is extremely strict. It's not convenient for me to maintain close contact with you."

"But thankfully, we have the Supreme Clarity Realm. This place is secluded enough for us to speak freely."

Zhang Pianpian then began to explain the situation in Zhang Yu's world. "The Myriad Laws Sect reveres the Dharma Realm above all else. The vast majority of their data and information is stored within it."

"The information I can gather through the Spirit Realm is limited. You can use it as a reference, but don't rely on it too heavily."

After cautioning Zhang Yu, she continued, "Gu Qingya has yet to reach Void Refinement, so it's hard to say with one hundred percent certainty which Dao Lineage he truly favors."

"After all, betrayal and deception are common within sects. There have been cases of cultivators switching sides at the last moment. Even after a law is established, there are opportunities to shift one's Dao Lineage for support."

"For instance, a law related to forbidden drugs once broke away from its original Dao Lineage and joined the Dharma Drug Dao Lineage, greatly advancing its development."

"Based on Gu Qingya's dual cultivation partners, the vast majority are cultivators from the Law Adjudication Dao Lineage. Therefore, he likely belongs to the same faction as Luo Wuji."

After discussing Gu Qingya, Zhang Pianpian turned to Lu Hengzhang.

"Lu Hengzhang is likely the most conservative of the conservatives in the Myriad Laws Sect. He supports the Innate Dao Lineage."

Zhang Yu asked curiously, "The Innate Dao Lineage? What does that one aim to control?"

Zhang Pianpian explained, "The core principle is 'the innate suppresses the postnatal.' The Innate Dao Lineage seeks to sever the path of advancement for lower cultivators. Their ultimate goal is to achieve 'one enlightenment, eternal enlightenment,' ensuring that Immortals remain Immortals forever — even after death, bankruptcy, or reincarnation."

"It would also ensure that sect members remain sect members for all eternity, generation after generation."

"Furthermore, it aims to completely block the advancement paths for lower cultivators, such as preventing people from the Lower Realms from joining the sect or being promoted within it."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's brow furrowed slightly. "In that case, Lu Hengzhang and I are destined to be enemies."

Realizing this, Zhang Yu understood that if Lu Hengzhang became the Minister of the Review Department, he would undoubtedly be targeted in countless ways.

After concluding his conversation with True Monarch Starfire and Zhang Pianpian, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "It seems Gu Qingya is the only suitable candidate."

---

Several days later, in Gu Qingya's office.

As he glanced over the review materials Zhang Yu had brought, Gu Qingya was initially rather nonchalant.

He wondered, "Why is Zhang Yu showing these documents to me? I'm not his direct superior."

"Could he have been influenced by my previous advice? Has he finally learned to pay his respects?"

At this thought, Gu Qingya nodded slightly, thinking, "That's more like it."

"We Lower Realm Natives need to be pragmatic to survive in the sect. When life slaps you, just check if it stung less than the last time. When you encounter someone who can defeat you, do your best to avoid giving them the chance."

But as he read further, his expression grew solemn.

Lifting his head, Gu Qingya looked at Zhang Yu and asked, "Did you review this yourself?"

After the incident with the Spirit Refining Art, Gu Qingya had come to trust Zhang Yu's judgment. Seeing Zhang Yu's firm nod, he knew the information in his hands was most likely accurate.

Gu Qingya sighed inwardly. "Some things seem trivial when they're not being weighed. But once they're on the scales, even thousands of pounds can't hold them down."

"Xiao Zhi's case might not have led to much under normal circumstances," Gu Qingya mused.

"But now... it's the perfect opportunity to join forces with Luo Wuji and counter Lu Hengzhang."

"If I use Xiao Zhi's situation to suppress Lu Hengzhang first, then once Luo Wuji is removed, I might have a chance to become the Minister of the Review Department myself."

At this thought, Gu Qingya looked at Zhang Yu and silently marked his friend profile for special attention.

In that moment, Zhang Yu was no longer the "State of Absolute Disqualification" in his eyes, but had transformed into the "State of Qualified Guidance", worthy of receiving personal instruction from a leader.

"If he truly helps me succeed, I wouldn't mind... dual cultivating with him to broaden his immortal path."

In Gu Qingya's view, a leader willing to dual cultivate with a subordinate was the ultimate sign of acceptance, a reward and a show of trust.

After a moment's thought, Gu Qingya continued, "Is there more?"

Zhang Yu nodded. "Yes. I can prove that at least ten of the cultivation arts Xiao Zhi reviewed have issues."

Gu Qingya's eyebrows shot up. "All reviewed by you in the last two days?"

Seeing Zhang Yu nod, Gu Qingya smiled. "What do you want?"

Zhang Yu replied, "Once Xiao Zhi is gone, I want to become the Group Leader."

Gu Qingya frowned. "Too hasty. As they say, 'more haste, less speed.' The more desperately you want something, the higher the price."

"You've only just reached the 2nd Rank. Why the rush? If you were willing to bide your time for a few more years, this contribution could earn you much more."

Seeing Zhang Yu's unwavering insistence, Gu Qingya shook his head, inwardly thinking that Zhang Yu was still too impulsive. His estimation of the young man dropped slightly.

"So be it," he thought. "I'll help you this once, but I won't reward you with dual cultivation. You have no idea what a massive opportunity you've just missed."

After a moment's consideration, Gu Qingya said, "Alright then. I'll arrange for someone to recommend you as a candidate for... Acting Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One. But whether you succeed will depend on the other candidates and the final job suitability assessment."

---

Several days later, Xiao Zhi, the Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One, stared blankly at the notice before him.

His reviews had issues?

Of course he knew his reviews had issues. In his view, when had the Edict Pavilion's cultivation art copyright reviews ever been completely flawless?

To him, having issues wasn't the problem. The real problem was having those issues exposed.

"Gu Qingya!"

"Muttering Gu Qingya's name, Xiao Zhi knew it was Gu Qingya who had teamed up with Luo Wuji to blow this matter wide open in the meeting."

"That bastard," he seethed. "Bullying an honest, low-level Sect Staff member like me just for some internal strife."

With this thought, Xiao Zhi hurried to find Deputy Minister Lu Hengzhang.

"Divine Monarch!" Xiao Zhi had barely spoken when Lu Hengzhang unleashed a beam of divine light, sealing his voice.

Lu Hengzhang said coldly, "First, go to the cultivation art creators whose reviews were flagged. Explain the situation to them in person and calm them down."

Xiao Zhi's face turned grim. "What if I can't explain it clearly?"

"Apologize, placate them, offer money... use any means necessary to minimize the fallout," Lu Hengzhang ordered coldly.

"What about the Investigation Team?" Xiao Zhi pleaded. "Divine Monarch, you have to help me!"

Lu Hengzhang snorted. "Help you? I'm just the Deputy Minister, not the Pavilion Master! Besides, with so many flawed cultivation arts exposed at once, even the Pavilion Master couldn't just let this slide."

Xiao Zhi said anxiously, "I was rushing to approve the cultivation arts you requested, so my reports weren't as thorough. But they weren't so flawed that the errors could be found easily. Was this premeditated? Have they been planning to target you all along?"

"Premeditated?" Lu Hengzhang snorted coldly. "Zhang Yu reviewed these cultivation arts. It was just in the last few days; it didn't take him long."

Xiao Zhi's eyes narrowed when he heard this. "Zhang Yu? Is that brat trying to take me down?"

Seeing his agitated state, Lu Hengzhang said indifferently, "What does it matter if you know? Just do as I say. The Investigation Team will arrive in a few days. Tell them you were careless, that you made mistakes while rushing to boost your performance, and that your judgment was flawed. Take full responsibility for everything..."

Xiao Zhi's face turned ugly. "If I admit to everything... what about my position as Group Leader...?"

"Leader my ass!"

Before Xiao Zhi could finish, Lu Hengzhang blasted him out of the office with a beam of divine light, his face a mask of despair.

A few days later, news spread through the groups that Group One's Leader, Xiao Zhi, had been demoted and transferred out of the Review Department.

No one cared about the loser's fate. Every group member now eyed Xiao Zhi's vacant position like a pack of hungry tigers.

After a meeting, a list of four candidates emerged. Zhang Yu's name was prominently on it, surprising many.

---

Following the directions, Zhang Yu arrived at the site for the Job Suitability Assessment.

"Of the four candidates," Zhang Yu thought, "only the one with the highest score in the Job Suitability Assessment can become the Acting Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One."

"After becoming Acting Group Leader, if there are no issues, I'll officially become Group Leader in a year and be promoted to the 3rd Rank."

At this thought, Zhang Yu's heart pounded with excitement. He was getting closer, step by step, to reaching the 4th Rank and obtaining the Soul Transformation Certificate.

Just then, Zhang Yu spotted Shen Qingyun nearby, along with the other two candidates.

He knew a bit about Shen Qingyun. She was Martial Dao Group One's ace grinder, formidable, but likely no match for him in this assessment.

His thoughts shifting, Zhang Yu turned his gaze to the other two candidates.

One was named Chen Xingxuan, a senior Level 2 Sect Staff member from the Mental Cultivation Group.

The Mental Cultivation Group primarily reviewed martial dao mental cultivation techniques. These techniques involved the mind and dao heart, making them ethereal, unpredictable, and difficult to grasp. They were considered the hardest of all martial dao techniques to comprehend, practice, assess, and review.

Consequently, only those who had demonstrated exceptional performance in other Martial Dao Groups and had mastered the Formless Martial Art's combined techniques up to "Martial Fifteen" were eligible for selection into the Mental Cultivation Group.

Although the Formless Martial Art was initially divided into only ten martial arts, it was continuously updated with supplementary techniques, starting from Martial Eleven and Martial Twelve, steadily enhancing a cultivator's ability to simulate cultivation arts.

As a result, the Mental Cultivation Group had always been regarded as the most challenging to review, with the highest average professional competence and performance among all martial dao-related groups.

Consequently, cultivators in the Mental Cultivation Group found it easier to secure promotions.

Chen Xingxuan had accumulated years of seniority in Martial Dao Group One. When his prospects of becoming Group Leader dimmed, he transferred to the Mental Cultivation Group.

In his first year there, he set all his former colleagues from Martial Dao Group One to "Do Not Disturb."

He knew they were no longer on the same path, and they could offer no further assistance to his future Dao.

Chen Xingxuan's eyes were fixed solely on the higher-ups.

As his gaze swept over Zhang Yu and Shen Qingyun, he had already summoned his exclusive artifact spirit to make an assessment.

"Celestial Inquiry Star, are these two my rivals?"

"Exclusive Artifact Spirit Celestial Inquiry Star is now processing your query."

The next moment, the artifact spirit's answer materialized before Chen Xingxuan's eyes: "According to available data, compared to you, Shen Qingyun is merely a nobody from Martial Dao Group One, not worth mentioning."

"Zhang Yu is a newcomer with decent abilities and impressive performance. However, in the selection for Group Leader, ability and performance are merely the most basic requirements. In all other aspects, he is far inferior to you."

Celestial Inquiry Star displayed rows of data for Chen Xingxuan: "You have already cultivated the Formless Martial Art's combination techniques to Martial Twenty. In terms of professional competence, you have long surpassed everyone in the martial dao groups."

"But this is your least remarkable advantage."

"In terms of assets, as a Sect Staff member for many years, your wealth far exceeds their combined total."

"In terms of reserve funds, your long history of timely repayments places you far above them."

"Furthermore, you are a high-level member of nine major platforms, including the Dharma Link Exchange, Wisdom Link Exchange, Technique Transmission Tower, and various Lending, Memory, and Cultivation Art Platforms. Your work and cultivation costs are significantly lower than theirs."

"And you have me as your consultant, assisting you in this assessment."

"Allow me to present this irrefutable analysis of your victory: Shen Qingyun and Zhang Yu are utterly insignificant before you."
