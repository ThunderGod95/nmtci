# Chapter 723: Aiding the Fallen Heavens

Kunxu Fifth Layer.

On the Soul Transformation Battlefield.

Swirling masses of dreamlike, illusory nebulae enveloped the entire boundless battlefield.

Within this celestial expanse, the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs of the Ten Universities and the Righteous Qi Alliance clashed relentlessly. The battle had raged on, overturning heaven and earth, shattering mountains and rivers. Both sides continuously calculated their opponent's moves, constantly revising their optimal combat strategies, and perpetually adapting to each other's changes.

The two warring factions, composed of Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, operated with highly efficient information exchange and coordination. They fought like two colossal titans, constantly shifting their techniques and tactics, transforming their own weaknesses while relentlessly striking at their opponent's vulnerabilities.

Their combat objectives, methods, and styles evolved moment by moment, in a ceaseless cycle of change and replacement.

Any cultivator below the Soul Transformation realm who dared to enter this fray would likely be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information flooding the battlefield. They would be utterly incapable of processing it, let alone keeping pace with the combat rhythm of the Divine Monarchs.

On this ever-shifting battlefield, where battles routinely spanned thousands of miles, uncontrolled weather phenomena and the resulting weather penalties had become commonplace.

Magical artifacts, bionics and puppets of all kinds were constantly shattered, often raining down like debris.

From time to time, entire buildings and factories would rise from the ground. Under the control of the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, they would gather materials on-site and produce equipment.

The appearance of these temporary structures and production lines invariably sparked new conflicts. In repeated cycles of offense and defense, they were either destroyed or abandoned due to unsustainable maintenance costs.

In this battle, the resources consumed every second, if converted to Spirit Coins, would be enough to stagger the entire mortal world.

Amidst this fierce struggle, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus from Heavenly Demon University could feel his condition steadily deteriorating.

His gaze swept over his Bionic Eye, which displayed his current statistics.

Magical Artifacts: less than 30% remaining.
Bionics: over 60% damaged..
Magic Power: even with backup reserves, less than 500,000 units left.

His gaze shifted to a nearby nebula as his consciousness crossed the Spirit Realm to communicate with the other Divine Monarchs: "Everyone, have you devised a way to break this formation?"

Although the firmament had been sealed, severing the Divine Monarchs' connection to the Spirit Realm below the Fifth Layer, they could still communicate with each other. By leveraging the Spirit Realm of the Kunxu Fifth Layer and using their numerous magical artifacts to stabilize the signal, they maintained ultra-high-speed information exchange.

At this moment, in a group chat named "Sailing Together," messages from various Divine Monarchs scrolled past like a cascading waterfall, sharing battlefield intelligence.

Following Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's message, Divine Monarch Wisdom Foundation from Vajra University sighed, "This Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation is a strategic-level Immortal Sect formation. Breaking out of it is far from easy."

Divine Monarch Wisdom Foundation had once personally refined a Nascent Soul for Zhang Yu at Divine Monarch Greenwood's request. The Nascent Soul he created was considered the best among the Ten Universities, and his own cultivation ranked among the top tier of Divine Monarchs.

Yet even he, in this nearly two-month-long Soul Transformation war, had already gone through eight primary combat bodies. He was now using his final backup.

His assessment of the situation grew increasingly grim.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander from Heavenly Sword University spoke: "According to our recent reconnaissance, the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation spans the entire battlefield. It has a total of 360 nodes, serving both to confine us and as the key to detonating the Fifth Layer."

Although Divine Monarch Blade Commander had previously lost a large chunk of flesh to a mere flick of Zhang Yu's fingertip and had sacrificed a disciple to take the blame, he had also secured an order for Great Void Flying Thunder.

Before launching the assault on the Fourth and Fifth Layers, he had brought a substantial supply of his university's own Great Void Flying Thunder.

In the nearly two months of intense fighting, these weapons had proven invaluable, allowing him to maintain a mid-to-upper-tier condition among the Divine Monarchs and significantly increasing his influence.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander continued, "The Rebel Army poured immense effort into this formation. It's clear they were meticulously prepared and had long been plotting this."

He added, "We rushed up here recklessly and walked right into their trap, which is why we've suffered such heavy losses."

Divine Monarch Azure Void from Myriad Laws University retorted, "Blade Commander, tell us something we don't already know. Stop with the sarcastic remarks."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: "I'm just speaking the truth. If someone hadn't shattered the firmament without so much as a word, pushing everyone to attack the Fifth Layer, how would we have ended up trapped here?"

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets from Immortal Armaments University: "During the meeting, I kept saying we weren't prepared, we weren't prepared! I don't know what the rush was. So what if they blew up the Fifth Layer? We knew there was a trap up there, yet we still charged in. And now look at us, all trapped here."

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets sighed. "Magnetic Pole, you're a master of artifact refinement, but you're a complete amateur when it comes to warfare. You fell for such a simple scheme."

Divine Monarch Azure Void: "Hmph, Thousand Puppets, I don't recall you complaining this much when you were grabbing loot. Now that the situation has turned against us, you're just stirring up trouble. Are you planning to surrender to the Righteous Qi Alliance too?"

Watching the messages flood the "Sailing Together" group chat, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sneered inwardly. She knew these old foxes were just using this as an excuse to gang up on her, trying to pressure her and Old Gao into shouldering more of the burden in the upcoming battles.

Just then, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus steered the conversation back on track: "Alright, everyone. Arguing won't defeat the Righteous Qi Alliance."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus: "We've already scouted the approximate locations of all 360 formation nodes. If we can destroy them one by one, we can unravel the great formation."

Principal Broken Radiance Divine Lord of Heavenly Sword University: "Difficult. All 360 nodes are arranged outside the formation."

Broken Radiance Divine Lord: "And this Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation is specifically designed to trap people. It's easy to enter but extremely hard to leave. Not only is it difficult for us to get out, but even the Righteous Qi Alliance's Soul Transformation experts would struggle to escape once they're inside."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: "But even if they can't get out, the Righteous Qi Alliance's production lines and corporations continuously supply them with Magic Power, Bionics, and medicinal pills... pouring resources into the formation to replenish their war consumption. We, on the other hand, are only consuming resources without any replenishment!"

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: "If this continues, they'll grind us down to death!"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus sighed and added, "Has your Heavenly Sword University found a way to bypass the barrier and communicate with the lower layers? If we could get reinforcements from below to break the great formation from the outside, the situation would be resolved instantly."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: "Over the past two months, through constant efforts to crack the barrier, we've only managed to send messages outside the formation and observe the situation beyond it, which allowed us to locate those 360 nodes. That alone was incredibly difficult."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: "If we also need to cross the two firmaments between the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Layers, it would be impossible to achieve any research results without at least a year and a half of work."

Hearing this, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus sighed inwardly. "A year and a half? By then, everything will have long been settled."

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets from Immortal Armaments University spoke up: "Even if we do make contact, what then? We've been out of touch for so long. Without our central command and coordination, the lower layers have probably descended into chaos."

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets continued: "By now, they've likely either been defeated one by one by the Righteous Qi Alliance or have already disbanded, each faction retreating and scattering to the winds."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander added: "Even if they're all still there, what's the use of them receiving our message if they haven't mastered advanced Spatial Technology and can't break through the firmaments? They simply can't reach us."

Watching the constant stream of messages in the group chat, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole thought to herself, "Blade Commander, Thousand Puppets... what schemes are these two hatching now? Spreading such demoralizing nonsense here."

Sensing the group's morale being affected, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole pondered for a moment and decided to say something to boost their confidence and raise their spirits.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Everyone, there is someone in the lower layers who has mastered profound Spatial Technology. His skill is even on par with my own. With him there, he will surely be able to break through the firmament."

Hearing this, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's spirits immediately lifted. "Who?" she asked.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: "My disciple, True Monarch Blazing Light, Zhang Yu."

Someone voiced their disbelief: "Zhang Yu? A cultivator who broke through to the Nascent Soul realm less than a year ago? How profound could his Spatial Technology possibly be?"

Divine Monarch Blade Commander said, "Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, I know you want to boost everyone's morale, but spouting such nonsense will likely do more harm than good."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole simply sent out the evidence. "Actually, Zhang Yu was involved in the development of the Heaven-Piercing Cone from the very beginning."

She continued: "Without Zhang Yu, I couldn't have created the Heaven-Piercing Cone. Later, when we developed the Great Void Cloud Repository, Zhang Yu worked with me from start to finish."

Divine Monarch Greenwood added: "I can testify that everything Magnetic Pole says is true."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole concluded: "Zhang Yu has not only cultivated 'Kunlun in the Palm' to Level 40 but has also gained insights from the Righteous Qi Alliance's Spatial Technology. If we can just hold on a little longer, he will definitely break through the firmament."

To be honest, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole wasn't entirely sure if Zhang Yu could ultimately succeed.

But given the current situation, she chose to believe in him. She also hoped this information would boost morale, reduce the likelihood of surrender, and buy them more time to continue fighting.

Hearing Magnetic Pole's words and seeing the evidence she provided, the other Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs were half-convinced, half-skeptical.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander said, "Even if Zhang Yu understands the technology, his lack of seniority will make it difficult for him to command respect. He also lacks the resources to mobilize the manpower and materials needed to break through the firmament."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "I have already entrusted him with the management of my numerous assets. It will be enough for him to organize the personnel needed to break through the firmament."

Divine Monarch Greenwood added, "I have done the same."

Hearing this, the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs were utterly astonished. They couldn't believe anyone would do such a thing, especially Magnetic Pole, who was notorious for her stinginess.

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets exclaimed, "Have you two gone senile? How could you hand over your assets to your disciple? You shouldn't do that even if you're dying!"

He continued, "Zhang Yu has probably already taken the money and run off by now!"

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets said, heartbroken and furious, "Even if Hidden Destiny and the others died, at least their assets were preserved. What's the point of being alive if your money is gone?"

Divine Monarch Hidden Destiny was a fallen Soul Transformation expert from Immortal Armaments University, and Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets had long been eyeing his inheritance covetously.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sneered, "You're still thinking about devouring Hidden Destiny's inheritance after you get back. Of course you'd hope their money is still intact."

As the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts argued among themselves, a sound like ten thousand thunderclaps erupted in the sky. Divine Monarch Chain Nexus, formerly of the Finance Department, let out a long roar and launched another attack, triggering a series of fierce clashes.

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's booming shouts echoed across the battlefield, spreading both inside and outside the formation.

"Everyone, the outcome is already decided! Why continue this futile struggle?"

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's voice rang out, "After Divine Monarch Great Devourer and the others surrendered, we have not mistreated them in the slightest. They still receive the treatment befitting Soul Transformation experts, and in the future, they will no longer be exploited by the Heavenly Court or their sects. They will be free and unrestrained, living a joyous life!"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole retorted angrily, "Who's the one engaged in a futile struggle? When the Heavenly Court descends, let's see how joyous and unrestrained you'll be then!"

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus smiled faintly. "Magnetic Pole, do you really think you can hold out until the Heavenly Court arrives? Trapped beneath the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation, you have nowhere to run.

"As for the Ten Universities below, not only can they not break through the firmament to resupply you, but they've already fallen into chaos."

With that, the Righteous Qi Alliance projected images from Kunxu's Third and Second Layers, showing riots by Junior College Students and monsterfolk, as well as a Nascent Soul rebellion at Celestial Monsters University.

However, the Righteous Qi Alliance had been broadcasting similar scenes for some time, and the Divine Monarchs of the Ten Universities had grown accustomed to them.

But in the next moment, their expressions changed drastically.

The projection showed Zhang Yu breaking open a Soul Transformation Hidden Legacy.

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus laughed. "Everyone, your disciples and descendants aren't thinking about rescuing you. Instead, they're already plotting to seize your assets.

"This Zhang Yu from Myriad Laws University truly possesses remarkable Spatial Technology to have breached a Soul Transformation Hidden Legacy."

As more footage of Zhang Yu breaking open Soul Transformation Hidden Legacies appeared, the minds of all the Soul Transformation experts trembled.

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus fanned the flames. "Everyone, the assets you left below have been stolen and plundered by Zhang Yu and his followers. They're nearly all gone.

"With things like this, are you still going to fight to the death here?

"In this Kunxu, whether it's the Heavenly Court and sects above or your disciples and students below, everyone wants a piece of you. What's left to protect? What's left to defend?

"Why not join us in rebellion? From now on, the heavens and earth will be vast, with no one to control or exploit you..."

In the Sailing Together Group chat, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets erupted in fury: "Magnetic Pole! Is this the 'good disciple' you raised?! We're fighting for our lives up here, and he's down there stealing our money?!"

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: "That bastard! We've been fighting for so long, and our losses probably don't even compare to the damage that scoundrel has caused!"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Don't be fooled by Chain Nexus's fake news. Those Finance Department types are experts at fabricating false reports."

Another Divine Monarch interjected: "But they've even provided a detailed list of the Soul Transformation Hidden Legacies. How could they know so much if the legacies hadn't truly been breached?"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's expression also turned grave as she began to worry about the vast assets she had left at Heavenly Demon University.

The critical situation, coupled with the immense threat to their personal assets, made the atmosphere among the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation Experts more tense than ever before.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander spoke up: "Everyone, we can't delay any longer. I propose we concentrate our power on one person and have them try to break through the great formation to attack it from the outside."

He continued: "My Heavenly Sword University's sword techniques are the most adept at slaughter and formation-breaking. Though this is extremely dangerous, I am willing to take the risk to aid the fallen heavens."

This suggestion had been raised before, but whether it could actually break the formation remained uncertain. More importantly, deciding who to concentrate their power on was a difficult matter.

As soon as Divine Monarch Blade Commander finished speaking, each university immediately nominated its own candidate, and the debate quickly became deadlocked.

At this moment, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets offered a different proposal: "I have another idea. Why don't we select a few responsible individuals to break the formation with their Primordial Spirits?"

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets: "Though this path is almost certain death, the situation is now extremely critical. For the sake of aiding the fallen heavens, someone must step forward."

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets spoke cryptically of "breaking the formation with the Primordial Spirit," but everyone present understood he meant for someone to self-destruct their Primordial Spirit.

As for the "candidates," everyone knew who they would be: the Divine Monarchs currently in the worst condition.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole immediately rejected the idea: "This is absolutely unacceptable! Thousand Puppets, say no more."

She didn't believe any of these Soul Transformation Experts would willingly sacrifice themselves to save the situation. Forcing someone to self-destruct their Primordial Spirit would likely just push them to surrender, ultimately causing the entire faction to fracture and collapse without a fight.

As the Divine Monarchs argued, another suggested: "Why don't we feign surrender, wait for an opportunity in secret, and then strike back to aid the fallen heavens?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed inwardly. She knew this was the desperate thinking of the weakest among them, who were already entertaining thoughts of surrender.

Watching the messages flood the group chat, Magnetic Pole thought to herself, "The morale has shattered. This team is no longer manageable."

While the debate raged on, Divine Monarch Cloud Haven of Myriad Laws University suddenly narrowed his eyes.

Positioned at a corner of the battlefield, he was using Heavenly Sword University's decryption method to observe glimpses of the scenes outside the formation.

Just then, his observation revealed countless red dots appearing on the ground outside the formation.

"What are those?" Divine Monarch Cloud Haven's heart skipped a beat. "Could it be some kind of attack from the Righteous Qi Alliance?"

He immediately shared the intelligence in the group chat.

At the same time, he began to make out what the red dots actually were.

"They look like... Spirit Realm Projections?"

"But what the hell are these projections of? Red envelopes?"

"Is someone scattering red envelopes?"

Soon, besides the red envelopes, Divine Monarch Cloud Haven also saw many things that resembled fiery lights.

He typed in the group chat: "Strange things have appeared outside the great formation."

True Monarch Cloud Haven: "[Fist] Blazing Light [Fire]"

True Monarch Cloud Haven: "There are more and more of them."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: "Cloud Haven, what are you talking about? What does this have to do with Blazing Light? Did he surrender too?"

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets: "Screenshot. Send a screenshot."

Just then, True Monarch Tranquility of Myriad Laws University spoke up: "I see them too."

True Monarch Cloud Haven: [Screenshot]

Staring at the dense, fiery lights in the screenshot, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets was momentarily stunned. As he zoomed in on the image, he finally saw that they were lines upon lines of characters, floating in the air.

It was a massive number of cultivators, each with "[Fist] Blazing Light [Fire]" floating above their heads, striking the firmament between the Fourth and Fifth Layers.

True Monarch Cloud Haven: "So many people! They're attacking the firmament!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven sent another screenshot. With each new image, the dense, star-like red dots expanded, threatening to ignite the entire firmament like a celestial fire.

Simultaneously, cracks began to appear in the firmament shown in the images, spreading rapidly like a spiderweb...

The Divine Monarchs watching this felt a jolt in their hearts. "The firmament... is about to shatter."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus exclaimed in shock, "Where did so many powerful experts come from to attack the firmament?"

Divine Monarch Blade Commander was utterly bewildered. "Blazing Light? What in the world is happening down there?"

Divine Monarch Azure Void asked, "All these people have 'Blazing Light' above their heads. Could this be True Monarch Blazing Light's doing?"

A tremor ran through the Divine Monarchs. Could Magnetic Pole have been right? Was Zhang Yu truly about to pierce the heavens?

The next moment, a world-shaking roar echoed throughout the Fifth Layer of Kunxu.

As the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs watched, the firmament below them — the barrier separating the Fourth and Fifth Layers — shattered with a deafening crash.

Immediately after, a dense crowd surged out like a tsunami, erupting onto the Fifth Layer's surface like a volcanic eruption.

At the same time, more and more Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs noticed the words "Blazing Light," instantly realizing that this upheaval was indeed related to Zhang Yu.

Watching the scene unfold, one Soul Transformation expert exclaimed excitedly, "It's broken! It's really broken!"

Divine Monarch Tranquility cheered, "Principal, True Monarch Blazing Light succeeded!"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled faintly and typed in the group chat: "Everyone, this is what it means to aid the fallen heavens."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus: "Magnetic Pole, I've never conceded to you in artifact refinement, but when it comes to teaching disciples... this time, I'm truly impressed."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: "It really was True Monarch Blazing Light who shattered the firmament! Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, I can't believe you predicted this! I'm impressed too."

Divine Monarch Immortal Puppet: "Excellent, excellent, excellent, Magnetic Pole! I knew trusting you was the right choice!"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole ignored the flattery in the chat and calmly stated, "Everyone, it's our turn to counterattack."

Simultaneously, the previously severed connections to the Fourth, Third, and Second Layers of the Spirit Realm were re-established with the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts.

With their power, they could instantly access vast amounts of information. The profiles of the Heaven-Piercing Cultivators immediately appeared in their Bionic Eyes.

Chang Buxiu, Junior College graduate, factory assembly line worker.

Wei Youye, currently enrolled in a Vocational College.

Zhao Tianxing, Junior College to Bachelor's Degree Program, currently enrolled as a Soul Cultivator...

As the Soul Transformation Cultivators watched one Heaven-Piercing Cultivator after another emerge — Junior College students, Lower College students, Soul Cultivator students, and even high schoolers — they were utterly astonished.

However, they had no time to dwell on this. The moment the Spirit Realm reconnected, the Soul Transformation experts immediately began inventorying their assets on the Second and Third Layers, as well as the out-of-control forces they had left behind on the Fourth Layer.

Countless artifact spirits, Soul Cultivators, and production lines that had been halted instantly roared back to life.

Magical artifacts, puppets, Flying Boats, and spatial equipment soared into the sky at the command of the Soul Transformation experts' thoughts, rushing toward the battlefield.

Zhang Yu also contacted his two masters immediately.

Zhang Yu: "Masters, are you alright?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: "We're fine, Zhang Yu. You did exceptionally well this time. Our efforts in nurturing you were not in vain."

Just then, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets spoke up in the group chat: "Magnetic Pole! Did Zhang Yu really distribute all of our university's Soul Transformation Hidden Legacy?"

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, having finished inventorying her assets, remained silent. Her aura surged, and her divine light seemed to tremble with it.

Beside her, Divine Monarch Greenwood had also completed his information gathering. He now knew everything about the Second and Third Layers, the details of the Great Void Red Envelopes, and the Heaven-Piercing process needing countless cultivators.

Even with Divine Monarch Greenwood's cultivation and dao heart, the sight of the expenditure records shook his dao heart, leaving him speechless with shock.
