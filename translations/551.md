# Chapter 551: Ye Xingli's Dao Seed

Inside the laboratory, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God puppet erupted with golden flames that swirled around its body like radiant halos, allowing it to levitate in mid-air.

"Yunzhen, record the following tests carefully," Zhang Yu instructed.

Zi Yunzhen nodded repeatedly, her eyes fixed on the puppet.

In the next moment, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God contracted rapidly, shrinking to one-third of its original size in an instant, before violently expanding again.

Zi Yunzhen continued filming while recording notes: This is the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's As-You-Wish Transformation ability. It can currently shrink to one-third of its original size and expand to three times its original size.

Next, Zhang Yu unleashed several streams of Gang Qi at the puppet.

With crackling explosions, visible shockwaves erupted across the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's surface, dispersing the incoming Gang Qi.

Zi Yunzhen continued recording: Shadowless Sonic Thunder: Uses directional sonic thunder to form a defensive barrier, capable of neutralizing kinetic energy attacks.

Immediately afterward, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God shrank again, while several streams of True Fire erupted from the experimental platform on the opposite side.

In the next moment, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God began flashing and leaping rapidly through the True Fire.

Zi Yunzhen recorded: Fire Evasion Transformation. The Heavenly Sun Radiance God can convert portions of its body into True Fire, using the flames for high-speed movement.

Shortly after, Zi Yunzhen stood beside Zhang Yu, assisting him with the tests. She began measuring the efficiency of Zhang Yu's control over the Heavenly Sun Radiance God and the information exchange between them.

As she watched lines of data scroll across the Bionic Eye, Zi Yunzhen thought to herself, "This Heavenly Sun Resonance ability facilitates a massive data exchange every second, transmitting all sensory information from the Heavenly Sun Radiance God to the human body. The efficiency of this information transfer rivals dual cultivation, almost like a constant, connected state of dual cultivation..."

Meanwhile, under the influence of Heavenly Sun Resonance, Zhang Yu felt as if he had gained an additional body.

The sensation was utterly mystical. The Heavenly Sun Radiance God and his original physical body now felt like his left and right hands. Zhang Yu could control both simultaneously, experiencing visual, auditory, and tactile sensations from both sides at once.

After completing the tests, Zi Yunzhen exclaimed excitedly, "Boss, all the basic attributes and functions have reached the Level 11 limit, meeting Foundation Establishment standards!"

"Should we report this now?"

Zhang Yu shook his head. "No rush. Let's spend another half-month leveling up further."

Although Level 11 met the minimum requirements for obtaining a Military Certificate, Zhang Yu didn't want to risk scraping by with the bare minimum. What if he failed? Wait another year?

He couldn't accept such a disastrous outcome.

Zhang Yu decided to invest another half-month in leveling up, aiming for a higher success rate in the Military Certificate evaluation.

In the following days, Zhang Yu continued refining the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, gradually enhancing its performance and expanding its capabilities.

In the laboratory that day, Zhang Yu, who was undergoing simulated training in the Supreme Clarity Realm, was also casually browsing news in the Spirit Realm.

When he saw several videos posted in the Hometown Group, a hint of curiosity flickered across his face.

Mountains and Rivers College - Lan Ling: [Video]

Lan Ling: Too bad I'm broke, or I'd definitely support Ye Xingli.

Joyful Union University - Lian Tianji: These influencers are all scams. Even if you pay, you can't actually meet them. You're better off giving the money to our Joyful Union University influencers — they can air-drop you for dual cultivation.

Lan Ling: You don't get it. Ye Xingli treats her fans exceptionally well. She doesn't even discriminate against Junior College students.

Fengdu College - Mo Tianyi: Exactly! Even if fans are poor, she never looks down on them.

Vajra University - Chu Qiuhe: She's truly different from other influencers.

After skimming through the messages, Zhang Yu realized that many students in the Hometown Group were actually fans of Ye Xingli.

He clicked on the video link Lan Ling had posted and found it was a clip from Ye Xingli's live stream.

In the video, Ye Xingli's long, star-like legs were perched atop a flying sword.

Simultaneously, countless other flying swords swirled around her, all vying to get closer to her feet.

"Is she selling flying swords through live streaming?"

After watching for a while, Zhang Yu realized this wasn't just ordinary product promotion.

Viewers could pay to mentally connect to the flying swords on set, manipulating them like Sword Spirits and testing their various capabilities in real-time.

For example, Ye Xingli stood on a flying sword, demonstrating its aerial maneuverability.

Watching Ye Xingli's feet surrounded by a swirling vortex of swords, Zhang Yu couldn't help but marvel at how lucrative being an internet celebrity truly was.

The video content reminded Zhang Yu of the school's recent training sessions for Ye Xingli.

How should they cultivate a Heavenly Chosen like her, ranked 3rd in the Artifact Refinement Department and 10th overall in the university, who was about to compete in the Ten Greats League?

Should they immerse her in advanced laboratories to accumulate artifact refinement experience and hone her skills?

Should they provide her with guidance from renowned masters to enhance her capabilities across all domains?

Or should they have her join a company, where she could be forged and refined under extreme pressure and life-or-death trials?

Students at ordinary universities might think along these lines.

But Zhang Yu knew they were all wrong.

Only mediocre universities would focus solely on teaching students how to improve their skills, their vision limited to mere professional techniques.

At a top-tier institution like Myriad Laws University, cultivating Heavenly Chosen students meant sparing no effort in guiding their earning potential. The goal was to maximize their income and assets, granting them the broadest possible development space.

Targeting Ye Xingli's unique situation, particularly her Artifact Refinement Department affiliation and influencer status, the university continuously funneled resources and promotional campaigns toward her. In addition to filming videos, she was required to livestream for over eight hours daily.

In just over a month, Ye Xingli's fan base skyrocketed from 3 million to over 6 million. Her cultivation strength, financial resources, and Immortal Dao Potential all surged exponentially, leaving Zhang Yu green with envy.

"As expected of Myriad Laws University," Zhang Yu thought. "They've truly mastered the art of 'teaching through wealth.' Isn't the highest form of education in Kunxu supposed to teach you how to make money?"

"If I could join the school team and become a key cultivation target, I wonder how the university would nurture me?"

"More construction projects? Probably not, since I've already switched to artifact refinement."

"Would they give me more artifact refinement outsourcing projects?"

"Or... because of my reputation as a dual cultivation prodigy, would they push me to engage in frenzied dual cultivation?"

At this thought, Zhang Yu couldn't help but worry. "How would I refuse if that happened? I wonder what kind of trials they'd put me through?"

While Zhang Yu was immersed in refining the prototype machine in the laboratory, True Monarch Magnetic Pole and the other Nascent Soul True Monarchs' research was also experiencing turbulent developments.

Feng Tingting: The competition for this experiment is fierce. Three students from True Monarch North Sea's project team were somehow infected with Dual Rest and joined the Dual Rest Cult.

Feng Tingting: True Monarch Silent Abyss's paper was proven to be fraudulent. Now embroiled in lawsuits, he has voluntarily withdrawn from the project.

Feng Tingting: True Monarch Ember Lamp has been reported for tax evasion and is currently under investigation. It's unclear when he'll be able to resume his duties.

Feng Tingting: True Monarch Dawnlight is caught in a counterfeit goods scandal. His social media accounts have been inactive for half a month. Among the Five Great Nascent Soul True Monarchs, only True Monarch String Tone remains to compete with True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Zhang Yu: How are you still so well-informed about the Artifact Refinement Department?

Feng Tingting: Don't underestimate my connections there! Besides, now that the Civil Engineering Department is thriving, mastering Civil Engineering is no less prestigious than mastering Artifact Refinement.

Zhang Yu thought to himself: It seems that after Civil Engineering's resurgence, Feng Tingting has regained her wealth and restored her connections within the Artifact Refinement Department.

Regardless, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's successive elimination of four rivals was a boon for Zhang Yu. It reduced his workload and allowed him to focus more intently on the Heavenly Sun Radiance God prototype machine project.

Another week passed in the blink of an eye.

On this day, Zhang Yu was adding the Nine Luminaries Thunder Shuttle functionality to the prototype machine. Thunder shuttles orbited the machine, their electrical arcs occasionally intertwining.

Just then, Ye Xingli entered the laboratory. After greeting Zhang Yu, she began designing and testing a magical artifact.

Zhang Yu initially paid little attention. After all, just spending time with Ye Xingli would help him replicate her Dao Seed.

Several days later, he finally met the requirements to replicate Ye Xingli's Dao Seed.

"From last year until now, it's finally done?" Zhang Yu thought. "The replication requirement for the Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart is to co-design an artifact refinement product of Level 11 or higher."

Zhang Yu glanced at the dao heart notation behind the Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart and mused, "Senior Sister's Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart, like Master's Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology, belongs to the dao heart category. Likely, both enhance artifact refinement."

Before obtaining the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology, Zhang Yu would have slowly sought opportunities to collaborate with Ye Xingli on product designs.

But now, with the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology, he merely activated its Dao Seed's power. His mind raced, vast amounts of information converging, assembling, and generating...

"I'll design a magical artifact tailored for Ye Xingli."

As if by instinct, the design blueprints materialized in his mind.

Simultaneously, his dao heart, driven by the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology's frenzied activity, regressed to Level 19 (84%).

Staring at the silk stockings in the blueprints, Zhang Yu muttered, "No... why silk stockings?"

"It's probably because I'm sharing the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology with True Monarch Magnetic Pole. Master's accumulated knowledge over the years has influenced the design outcome."

Zhang Yu nodded inwardly. "After all, her accumulated knowledge far surpasses mine. It must be the key factor shaping the design's direction."

Suddenly, Zhang Yu remembered that his mind contained not only Immortal Dao knowledge acquired from Kunxu but also a considerable amount of knowledge from Earth.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Master's knowledge and information are vastly richer than mine — they're not even on the same scale."

"Earth's knowledge mixed into the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology... shouldn't have a significant impact."

"It shouldn't, right?"

Then Zhang Yu realized, "Wait... my design goal was to create a magical artifact suitable for Senior Sister Ye Xingli. Master undoubtedly understands her better than I do. These silk stockings must be her idea."

"It can't be my meager knowledge corrupting the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology, right?"

Zhang Yu shook his head and approached Ye Xingli, intending to discuss the design blueprints with her.
