# Chapter 488: He's Different

The day after Zhang Yu returned to his dormitory, he still hadn't received permission to leave campus. He decided to continue his artifact crafting practice.

Zhang Yu entered the Artifact Refinement Laboratory and first grasped a swirling, bright yellow flame. He inhaled it into his body, circulating it through his meridians while continuously channeling Magic Power into it, condensing the flame and Magic Power together.

Next, he channeled the combined bright yellow flame and Magic Power into a second-hand magical artifact on the laboratory table, forming a special restriction that gradually altered the artifact's properties.

As Zhang Yu repeatedly circulated his energy, each surge of Magic Power seemed to elicit a faint dragon's roar from within the artifact. Scalelike patterns rippled across its surface, as if the entire artifact had come to life.

The Artifact Refinement Technique Zhang Yu was practicing was called the Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual.

The bright yellow flame he was using was known as Dragon Vein Power.

Zhang Yu sighed, "Ah, impure and mixed — clearly from an artificial Dragon Vein."

Lady Fortune retorted, "Nonsense! Where can ordinary people find a real Dragon Vein these days? Using an artificial one is already a luxury."

Zhang Yu shook his head and refocused on cultivating his Cultivation Art.

The Cultivation Art he was practicing now differed from the various artifact crafting techniques he had previously studied.

Those techniques involved crafting different magical artifacts based on specific blueprints.

In contrast, the Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual he was now cultivating granted him the ability to infuse Dragon Vein Power into various magical artifacts, enhancing their performance.

Many other Cultivation Arts enhanced one's artifact crafting abilities. For example, Daoist Arts like the Fire Control Divine Mirror allowed practitioners to refine materials more effectively by mastering True Fire.

There were also Daoist Arts related to forbidden techniques, such as the Cloud Character Twelve Forbidden Arts, which enhanced a practitioner's ability to stack forbidden techniques onto magical artifacts, resulting in more powerful artifacts with advanced auxiliary functions.

And then there were various unclassifiable Artifact Refinement Techniques, such as the Five Thunder Refinement Urgency Method, the Red Dust Weapon Refinement Art, and the Sword Nurturing Art.

Beyond these Cultivation Arts that enhanced artifact crafting abilities, there were also techniques for utilizing magical artifacts, such as the Artifact Control Essentials, the Sleeve Hidden Azure Dragon, and the Treasure Theft Art. These techniques could amplify the power of magical artifacts during use or disrupt an opponent's artifacts in combat.

In the realm of artifact crafting, beyond the myriad blueprints for magical artifacts, the Artifact Refinement Techniques themselves were vast and profound, encompassing a dazzling array of methods that touched upon every conceivable field and discipline.

Zhang Yu had chosen to cultivate the Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual solely because this Artifact Refinement Technique could help him complete the Artifact Refinement Prodigy set within his Chain Formation Diagram.

After True Monarch Magnetic Pole bestowed upon him the Treasure Appraisal Manual, Zhang Yu had speculated that the Artifact Refinement Prodigy set effect would enhance his artifact crafting abilities. He believed that completing the set sooner would yield greater benefits.

However, learning each artifact blueprint and mastering the methods of crafting various magical artifacts had already drained too many Spirit Coins.

Cultivating Artifact Refinement Techniques was even more costly, making it impossible for Zhang Yu to afford both simultaneously. He had prioritized learning artifact blueprints to pass his exams and improve his earning capacity.

Now, with his income soaring, Zhang Yu finally had the financial foundation to cultivate the Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual.

Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual - Level 7 (0/70)

After another infusion of Dragon Vein Power, Zhang Yu examined the second-hand magical artifact before him and thought, "It seems almost saturated."

"Sigh, cultivating this technique is so expensive. Not only do I need to buy cheap, used magical artifacts for practice, but I also need to purchase materials like Dragon Vein Power."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "If I can't go out to construction sites to earn money and have to rely solely on the laboratory stipend and other odd jobs, it'll be really tough to make ends meet."

Just then, the detailed arrangements for his fieldwork and competition participation arrived.

"First, there's a magical artifact called the Sun-Moon Sky-Piercing Bracelet, funded by the project team and temporarily loaned to me."

Zhang Yu opened the artifact's description and mused, "This Sun-Moon Sky-Piercing Bracelet is similar to the Azure Silk Flying Sword. Both are magical artifacts that connect to the Spirit Realm Network."

"However, the Azure Silk Flying Sword relies on the eighty-four thousand Sky-Patrolling Flying Swords deployed by Heavenly Sword University on the second layer."

"The Sun-Moon Sky-Piercing Bracelet, on the other hand, draws power from the sun and moon in the sky."

He had long heard that the sun and moon in Kunxu's second-layer sky were crafted by Myriad Laws University as colossal magical artifacts capable of radiating a Spirit Realm Network that covered the entire second layer.

But only after reading the Sun-Moon Sky-Piercing Bracelet's user manual did Zhang Yu learn that the sun-like artifact was called Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness, while the moon-like artifact was named Long Night Jade Palace.

"The Sun-Moon Sky-Piercing Bracelet can directly connect to these two artifacts at any time, allowing me to call for the university's support whenever needed."

"Perfect! This saves us the trouble of having to go through Heavenly Sword University when communicating via the Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword."

Zhang Yu nodded in satisfaction.

In addition to the Sun-Moon Sky-Piercing Bracelet, the school had also approved an increase in Zhang Yu's security clearance, making it more difficult for outsiders to track his movements.

Furthermore, he was granted access to a range of magical artifacts and Talismans, allowing True Monarch Magnetic Pole to immediately deploy these resources when providing support to Zhang Yu.

"With these measures in place, I should be much safer now," Zhang Yu murmured, exhaling in relief. Finally, he could resume his work without worrying about financial strain.

In the company group chat, Zhang Yu sent a message: "Work starts now! Get ready to work!"

Zhao Tianxing: "Received!"

Mo Tianyi: "Received!"

Che Yufei: "Received!"

The company group chat immediately sprang to life.

Zhao Tianxing and the others, who had been idle for two days due to Zhang Yu's situation, breathed a collective sigh of relief.

Zhao Tianxing thought to himself, "Finally, back to the construction site! These past two days of odd jobs were a far cry from the conditions there."

As his experience as a Soul Cultivator grew, Zhao Tianxing increasingly understood a harsh truth: "If you don't do it, there are plenty of other Soul Cultivators who will." For someone with only a Vocational College degree, job opportunities were rare, and good jobs even rarer.

Just as Zhang Yu was out working, Ping Han, exhausted both physically and mentally, let out a deep sigh.

Fu Xinyao immediately pressed her hand over his mouth, saying, "Hold it in. Don't just spit it out."

Ping Han, helpless, could only clamp his mouth shut.

Fu Xinyao smiled faintly and asked, "So, how does it feel practicing with your former junior brothers and sisters?"

Forcing down his humiliation, Ping Han replied slowly, "As long as you're satisfied."

At that moment, Ping Han began to tremble violently. Sensing the tremor, Fu Xinyao's gaze shifted, and she stepped out onto the street.

Reviewing the data transmitted by the Yin Artifact, Fu Xinyao quickly locked her gaze onto Yu Xinghan.

"Over a thousand self-study sessions?" Fu Xinyao's eyes flickered. "Does Myriad Laws University actually have such talent?"

Sensing the Yin Artifact's tension, Fu Xinyao asked, "Do you know him?"

Ping Han struggled inwardly for a moment before sighing and saying, "He's a friend of Zhang Yu."

"Oh?" Fu Xinyao smiled. "That's perfect, then."

Meanwhile, Yu Xinghan suddenly frowned, feeling as if someone were calling out to him.

He turned his head and saw Fu Xinyao standing in the alleyway, waving at him repeatedly.

"Hey, classmate! Want to practice cultivation together?"

Yu Xinghan smiled slightly and approached her, asking, "What's the price?"

Simultaneously, his Bionic Eye activated its recording function, and he thought to himself, "Damn it... trying to steal business near our shop?"

"I don't even see a license. I'll report you first."

After finishing a long day's work, Zhang Yu hurried back to school to participate in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's experiment.

This time, after Jade Nectar Maiden Forty-Eight activated, the rhombus-shaped crystal Yin Artifact transformed into a mark that clung tightly to Zhang Yu's forehead, remaining there for over half an hour.

"Wait..." Zhang Yu said, his expression troubled as he touched the Yin Artifact on his forehead. "What's going on here?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole, observing thoughtfully from the side, remarked, "This Yin Artifact has actively equipped itself to you. It seems it wants to stay with you."

Zhang Yu asked, puzzled, "Stay with me? Why?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole didn't answer directly. Instead, she said, "Step outside the laboratory and see what happens."

Watching Zhang Yu leave the laboratory, the Yin Artifact still firmly attached to his forehead, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's gaze flickered slightly. "Now, leave the research institute and see what happens."

Zhang Yu exclaimed in surprise, "Huh? This... won't it cause trouble?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "With me watching, what trouble could possibly arise?"

As Zhang Yu left the laboratory, True Monarch Magnetic Pole secretly followed and observed, occasionally sending messages to guide him.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Stop covering your forehead.

Zhang Yu: Won't this draw too much attention?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: What's so attention-grabbing about it? With my seals in place, no one will recognize it as a Soul Transformation Bionic.

Zhang Yu lowered his hand, gazing at the street before him, feeling utterly lost.

Noticing his confusion, True Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "Just wander around."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Go wherever you feel like."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "As you walk, focus on sensing the Yin Artifact's changes. She might guide you."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "But remember, you must never communicate with her."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "If you hear her voice, tell me immediately."

Zhang Yu sighed helplessly and began walking, trying to sense the artifact's presence. Just then, a message from Zhang Pianpian appeared in his Bionic Eye.

Zhang Pianpian: "Don't reply. I'm sending this secretly."

Zhang Pianpian: "I'm going to communicate with the artifact spirit and see what she wants."

Zhang Pianpian's consciousness entered the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact. "Jade Nectar Maiden Forty-Eight," she asked, "what do you want?"

Jade Nectar Maiden Forty-Eight: "I sense the presence of my kind."

Jade Nectar Maiden: "I want to find them."

Zhang Pianpian: "Your kind?"

Zhang Pianpian: "You mean High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts? Where are they?"

Jade Nectar Maiden Forty-Eight: "I don't know, but they're calling to me."

Zhang Pianpian: "Why did you attach yourself to Zhang Yu?"

Jade Nectar Maiden: "Because he's different, unlike most people here."

Zhang Pianpian: "How is he different?"

Jade Nectar Maiden: "He's more... distinct."

Zhang Pianpian: "More distinct?"

Jade Nectar Maiden: "He's practiced self-cultivation over a thousand times."

Jade Nectar Maiden: "He stands out in the crowd here. We recognized his uniqueness immediately."
