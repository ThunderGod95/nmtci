# Chapter 644: Dao Seed Activation Requirements, Fighting for Millions of Extreme Tiger Users

Zhang Yu's heart jolted as he read this. He thought to himself, "A-Zhen has invested nearly all her assets into this battle. Risking her life like this — what's the difference between this and selling her house to gamble on stocks?"

At that moment, Zhang Yu sensed the unwavering resolve in her heart.

"Leaving her lower body to me for immediate retrieval... is that so I can swap back her Spiritual Root without leaving any vulnerabilities?"

"She's even considered this? A-Zhen is truly determined."

He instinctively wanted to urge Bai Zhenzhen not to fight Kuang Tianqing so recklessly, but repeatedly sensing the firmness and determination in her words, he knew his efforts would be futile.

"This Ten Greats League is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for A-Zhen. How could I possibly ask her to give it up?"

"Just like my own determination to claim first place — who could ever dissuade me from that?"

Zhang Yu sighed, his thoughts drifting back to their high school days when they had both resolved to get into the Ten Great Universities.

"On this path of the Immortal Dao, how many haven't risked everything, even bankruptcy? Who has the right to tell anyone else to give up?"

Zhang Yu shook his head, resolving inwardly, "Even if it means incurring massive debt, I will revive A-Zhen if she truly falls in battle."

After ending his communication with Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu turned his attention back to Dao Qiankun's corpse lying before him.

Ever since Dao Qiankun's body had been placed in the Spirit Hall, Zhang Yu had been trying to sense the Dao Seed within the corpse and attempt to replicate it.

Only recently had the Dao Seed within Dao Qiankun's corpse finally stabilized and become visible to Zhang Yu, allowing him to perceive the information it contained.

"Enhance Dao Qiankun's physical body to its current peak potential."

"But how?"

Zhang Yu stared at the corpse, utterly stumped. How could a corpse be further enhanced? How could it reach its peak potential? Surely reviving it wasn't the only way?

"Ultimately, I'll have to experiment to find out."

After a moment's thought, Zhang Yu approached Dao Qiankun's body, clasped his hands in a respectful bow, and said, "Brother Dao, what I'm about to do is for your own good."

"If you're not satisfied, just say the word, and I'll stop immediately."

With that, Zhang Yu began wiping down Dao Qiankun's corpse.

As he wiped, Dao Qiankun's artifact spirit occasionally materialized due to Zhang Yu's touch, engaging in casual conversation with him.

After wiping the corpse, Zhang Yu tilted his head, thinking, "Is this useless?"

He then tried massaging the corpse, stretching its legs and feet to exercise its joints and muscles...

Zhang Yu spent his free time each day experimenting, constantly checking the corpse's condition. Yet, even on the day before the battle with Tian Shengong, he had made no progress.

"Sigh, what exactly does it mean for the physical body to reach a state of perfection?" Zhang Yu wondered. "Why is the Dao Seed Register's description so vague?"

Just as Zhang Yu was feeling frustrated, the artifact spirit suddenly emerged from the corpse and announced, "Left Magic Power Circuit Module data lost. Magic Power operational precision decreased by 3%. Operation can continue."

Zhang Yu froze momentarily, thinking, "Is this reporting the condition of Brother Dao's Bionic?"

"Brother Dao has only been dead for a short time, and his Bionic is already malfunctioning?"

Zhang Yu pressed his palm against the corpse's back, channeling Magic Power into it to examine Dao Qiankun's Bionic.

"Hmm?" he thought. "This Bionic doesn't seem to be in harmony with the corpse."

"Could the physical body's perfection be related to this?"

Unfortunately, Zhang Yu didn't have much time. The semifinals were about to begin, so he had to leave the Spirit Hall with a lingering sense of unease.

Back on the Flying Boat, Zhang Yu began installing the brand-new Seven Absolutes Bionic.

True Monarch String Tone's projection materialized, addressing Zhang Yu: "Time is too short. This modified Seven Absolutes Bionic hasn't undergone thorough testing. You'll likely need to make adjustments during actual combat."

As each piece of the Bionic was fitted onto his body, surging Magic Power coursed through the circuits, Zhang Yu felt waves of immense power surging through his veins.

Zhang Yu took a deep breath, sensing the profound changes within him. "Thank you, True Monarchs," he said. "This new Seven Absolutes Bionic is exactly what I needed."

Watching Zhang Yu's departing figure, True Monarch Tranquility asked, "Does this new Seven Absolutes Bionic meet military-grade standards?"

True Monarch String Tone replied, "Without formal evaluation, it can't be officially classified as military-grade."

"But purely in terms of performance, I'd say this modified Seven Absolutes Bionic is a monster among Level 20 magical artifacts, possessing the potential to reach military-grade status."

"Its true capabilities will depend on how Zhang Yu utilizes it."

Meanwhile, as the semifinals of the Ten Greats League began, the popularity of live streams on various platforms surged dramatically.

Advertisements featuring Extreme Tiger flooded the streams, almost giving the impression that the entire Ten Greats League was sponsored by Extreme Tiger.

Countless Extreme Tiger fans across numerous schools eagerly watched the battle, eager to witness Tian Shengong use the power of Extreme Tiger to utterly defeat Zhang Yu.

In contrast, Kuang Tianqing, the favorite to win the championship, received surprisingly little attention. Most viewers assumed she would secure an easy victory, just as she had in the previous round.

In the waiting area, Kuang Tianqing gazed at Bai Zhenzhen, a hint of surprise in her eyes. "Bai Zhenzhen, I sense the fire of battle in your heart."

"It seems you've made up your mind for today's fight."

Kuang Tianqing smiled. "As expected of a practitioner of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao. Even knowing the vast gap between our strength, you still choose to fight."

"I can't decide whether to call you brave or foolish."

Bai Zhenzhen's eyes flickered as she met Kuang Tianqing's gaze. "Kuang Tianqing," she declared, "I will give this battle my all."

"I will shatter every humiliation you've inflicted on me and Zhang Yu."

Kuang Tianqing grinned. "Then I'll savor your taste in the arena."

In an instant, both were enveloped in layers of divine light, soaring skyward toward the battlefield.

Meanwhile, Tian Shengong approached Zhang Yu and immediately started a live broadcast.

"Zhang Yu," Tian Shengong said, "are you ready? After you lose, you'll wear Extreme Tiger Bionics. I've already prepared a set for you."

Zhang Yu retorted without backing down, "Extreme Tiger Provokation."

As they spoke, both were transported to the battlefield.

Tian Shengong roared, and the Giant Puppet beneath his feet surged skyward, hovering like a fortress in mid-air.

"Zhang Yu, today's battle isn't just for Immortal Soldiers or Extreme Tiger. It's for the countless students across the world who can't afford high-end Bionics or expensive magical artifacts."

"To make the highest-performance products accessible to everyone in the world, to push this world to its peak potential, to ensure every resource is fully utilized and every talent is fully realized, I won't just defeat you — I'll conquer Kuang Tianqing and claim first place in the Ten Greats League!"

Tian Shengong's voice reverberated across the battlefield like thunderclaps, reaching not only Zhang Yu but also countless viewers watching the live broadcast. The Spirit Realm erupted in cheers.

Meanwhile, torrents of water surged across the ground, transforming the earth into a vast, watery expanse.

Simultaneously, the sun-like form of the Heavenly Sun Radiance God rose from the floodwaters, its blinding light illuminating heaven and earth.

Zhang Yu harbored no ill will toward Myriad Dao or Extreme Tiger. To him, it was all just business competition within Kunxu, with no one inherently superior to another.

However, since Myriad Dao had invested in advertising for him, even naming a signature move after their brand, and to capitalize on the publicity, Zhang Yu couldn't remain silent.

Zhang Yu stepped out of the "sun" and addressed Tian Shengong in a clear voice, "Tian Shengong, is your so-called 'making the most of every resource and utilizing every talent' just a euphemism for endless plagiarism and patchwork?"

Tian Shengong snorted coldly. "All of Extreme Tiger's products are developed in-house. If you have a problem, file a complaint."

As he spoke, the Giant Puppet beneath his feet shuddered violently. Countless boot-like and louse-like components and modules detached from its body, coalescing mid-air into dozens of humanoid puppets, each taller than a grown man.

"Zhang Yu! I know you're skilled in Civil Engineering and formations. Today, face my Extreme Tiger Formation Breaker!"

The smaller puppets plunged into the ground, wreaking havoc on the rock strata and disrupting the Earth Vein environment, denying Zhang Yu any chance to deploy his formations.

"These are Extreme Tiger's Civil Engineering Puppet Teams. With their construction prowess, you won't even dream of setting up a formation today."

"Now, face my Sea-Filling strike!"

The Giant Puppet's massive hands clenched the air, unleashing an invisible Earthly Fiend Gravity that instantly collapsed distant mountain ranges.

"This is Extreme Tiger's Earthly Fiend Module," the narrator explained, "capable of generating anti-gravity waves to shatter mountains and crush stone."

As massive boulders and debris surged toward the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor's swirling torrent, threatening to engulf the entire body of water, Tian Shengong laughed heartily. "Even if you summoned an entire sea today, I would fill it all!"

"Prepare to face my Force Breaker! Sword Breaker! Fire Breaker! Three strikes!"

With a sharp cry, Tian Shengong summoned twelve spherical orbs behind the Giant Puppet. These orbs, orbiting the puppet's body, erupted with Earthly Fiend Gravity, countering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

Simultaneously, massive Spirit Realm Fluctuations surged from within the puppet, attempting to suppress the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation.

A fluorescent layer shimmered across the puppet's surface, showcasing Extreme Tiger's latest high-temperature resistance technology.

Witnessing these preparations, Zhang Yu realized with sudden clarity, "They've prepared countermeasures for every one of my techniques?"

"But all their preparations..."

Battlefield scenes and data flashed through Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye as he thought to himself, "The technologies they're using... they're all based on Myriad Laws' research, aren't they?"

"Truly worthy of the Extreme Tiger Battle Art."
