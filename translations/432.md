# Chapter 432: Reporting to the Heavenly Court

True Monarch Celestial Elephant smiled faintly as he observed Ping Han, who topped the construction output rankings. He pointed at the light screen and said, "Rankings depend on how you calculate them."

"If we were to rank by kill count, the results would look quite different."

The data on the light screen abruptly shifted from construction output to Yellow Turban Warrior kill counts.

In an instant, Zhang Yu surged to first place, with Ping Han trailing in second.

Many guests were surprised by this outcome. After all, Ping Han's final mountain-shattering strike had been far more spectacular and destructive than Zhang Yu's. Yet Zhang Yu had surpassed him in kill count!

True Monarch Celestial Elephant explained, "While Ping Han's final strike was undeniably impressive, it lacked Zhang Yu's precision control. Consequently, its effective killing power was less concentrated."

With a thought, he projected live footage of the Righteous Gods clearing the battlefield onto the light screen.

In Ping Han's examination area, the Righteous Gods were shown dismantling and transporting the "small mountain" he had hurled moments ago, before returning to their distant positions.

Beneath the upturned mound, numerous smaller Yellow Turban Warriors lay buried in the crater, still combat-ready.

One strike, one kill, one shot, one hit, one move, one victory!

Watching the scene unfold, Director Gao thought to himself, "Ping Han's Mountain-Shattering Strike crashed down, directly pulverizing the massive Yellow Turban monsters at the epicenter!"

"But the smaller Yellow Turban Warriors seized the opportunity to burrow into the ground and evade the attack!"

"Moreover, the 'small mountain' formed from the debris of the larger monsters created gaps between the mountain mass and the ground!"

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu's battlefield appeared on the other screen!

Corpses of Yellow Turban Warriors were being cleared away one by one. Each body appeared relatively intact, yet every single one had been precisely destroyed, leaving no survivors across the entire battlefield!

Deng Bingding, also observing the scene, grew increasingly astonished. "Zhang Yu is only a junior! It hasn't even been two and a half years since he first entered Myriad Laws University, yet he's already made such astonishing progress?"

As the aftermath of Zhang Yu and Ping Han's battles were displayed, True Monarch Celestial Elephant declared, "Zhang Yu achieved greater lethality with a smaller-scale operation and lower costs. Doesn't this clearly demonstrate his superiority over Ping Han?"

Hearing this, many civil engineering experts in the audience nodded in agreement. After all, mastering cost reduction was as essential a skill for civil engineers as maximizing construction value.

Geng Chenyi scoffed, "How can a civil engineering exam be judged by kill count? It should focus on the scale and efficiency of the construction!"

True Monarch Celestial Elephant retorted, "This is the Military Certificate Examination, which grants access to military-grade martial arts. How can we ignore combat performance?"

As the debate raged on, True Monarch Cloud Haven, who had remained silent until now, turned to Director Lin and asked, "Old Lin, what's your take on this?"

Director Lin replied, "Ping Han has his strengths, and Zhang Yu has his own merits. But Ping Han is from the final graduating class."

True Monarch Celestial Elephant shook his head. "What does that matter? The Military Certificate values talent above all else. Are we judging candidates based on age?"

A guest suggested, "Why not award the Military Certificate to both of them?"

True Monarch Cloud Haven dismissed the idea. "The Heavenly Court only grants one slot. It's impossible for both to receive it."

Director Gao, standing nearby, sighed inwardly. He knew that no matter how exceptional a student might be, the Heavenly Court would never reconsider its decisions.

As the judges and guests shared their opinions, True Monarch Cloud Haven summarized, "Both Ping Han and Zhang Yu have their merits!"

"Ping Han's Magic Power is formidable. By harnessing the power of the Soul Transformation stage and channeling the forces of heaven and earth, he unleashed a battle of earth-shattering proportions!"

"Zhang Yu's Martial Dao has been forged through countless trials. With a single, decisive strike that swept the entire arena, he truly embodies the spirit of 'fighting heaven and battling earth'..."

As he spoke, True Monarch Cloud Haven's mind flashed back to his recent conversation with True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Particularly regarding Zhang Yu, perhaps due to his connection with True Monarch Magnetic Pole, True Monarch Cloud Haven had focused not only on Zhang Yu's Martial Dao but also on aspects beyond it.

"Zhang Yu's magical artifacts may appear unremarkable, but they played a crucial role!"

"Without their enhancements, his speed in consuming construction materials would likely have been much slower, and his remaining power might not have been sufficient to completely annihilate his opponents!"

With this thought, True Monarch Cloud Haven sent a message to True Monarch Magnetic Pole:

True Monarch Cloud Haven: Magnetic Pole, what's Zhang Yu's level in artifact crafting?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: ?

True Monarch Cloud Haven: Screenshot of Zhang Yu's artifact crafting instructor. Image file!

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Oh, I'd completely forgotten! I do have such a disciple!

"True Monarch Cloud Haven: I'm overseeing the Military Certificate Examination!"

"True Monarch Cloud Haven: I want to know Zhang Yu's artifact crafting skill!"

"True Monarch Magnetic Pole: If he were in the Artifact Refinement Department, he'd be in the top five of his class!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven was slightly surprised. "Which of his magical artifacts did he craft himself?"

As the memory of his conversation with True Monarch Magnetic Pole flashed through his mind, True Monarch Cloud Haven thought to himself, "This Zhang Yu has great potential!"

"The entire university is like a chessboard. While the Civil Engineering Department's inter-university competition is important, the Artifact Refinement Department is ultimately more crucial!"

"By supporting Magnetic Pole and Zhang Yu, we can ensure Zhang Yu masters the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power before transferring departments, making him a cross-disciplinary artifact crafting talent!"

"If we can then leverage this to counter the Civil Engineering Department, fostering closer collaboration between the Artifact Refinement and Civil Engineering Departments, we'll gain an additional advantage in balancing the Finance Department's influence and curb the speculative coin trading trend on campus!"

"Old Gao would surely approve of this plan!"

Though True Monarch Cloud Haven outwardly never opposed students trading Jade Nectar Coins, it was impossible for him to be completely indifferent to his own students rushing to become prey for Joyful Union University's predatory practices.

True Monarch Cloud Haven could already imagine the kind of atmosphere that would sweep through the Civil Engineering Department if Ping Han were to obtain the Military Certificate.

Of course, whether it was the overall situation of the various departments at Myriad Laws University or the students' analyses of cryptocurrency speculation, all these considerations ultimately rested on Zhang Yu's strength.

If Zhang Yu's strength hadn't been marginally superior to Ping Han's from a certain perspective, True Monarch Cloud Haven wouldn't have pondered these matters so deeply.

Thoughts flashed through his mind like lightning, but True Monarch Cloud Haven continued speaking without pause: "However, while Ping Han wields the power of heaven and earth with immense might, he ultimately lacks perfect control, leaving vulnerabilities and flaws."

"Zhang Yu, on the other hand, has earned every ounce of his strength through his own efforts. With unparalleled fighting spirit and the aid of bone ash, flesh, and digested materials, he has forged a steel defense line that has annihilated more enemies than any other, all at minimal cost. In my view, this embodies the true spirit of civil engineering!"

"However, my assessment is merely my own."

"I will report all the data from today's examination, along with your opinions, truthfully to the Heavenly Court. The final decision, of course, rests with the Great Gods and immortals of the Heavenly Court."

Geng Chenyi, standing nearby, thought to himself: The lofty sect immortals wouldn't bother with such trivial matters of the Heavenly Court. They'll likely delegate the decision to the Great Gods anyway!

The Great Gods were unlikely to be overly involved in this examination. The final decision would most likely be based on a consensus reached by the Righteous Gods overseeing the event, taking into account the opinions of the assembled experts.

Normally, the Heavenly Court wouldn't overturn recommendations made during the Military Certificate Examination. Given that True Monarch Cloud Haven and True Monarch Celestial Elephant both supported Zhang Yu, it seemed highly probable that Zhang Yu would receive the Military Certificate for the Civil Engineering Department this year.

Geng Chenyi thought to himself, "Ping Han... what a pity! If he had secured the Military Certificate, it would have undoubtedly boosted the sales of Jade Nectar Coins!"

Hearing True Monarch Cloud Haven's words, the assembled experts shared Geng Chenyi's sentiment, realizing that Zhang Yu was almost certain to receive the Military Certificate.

Of course, the formal process still required submission for approval and final determination by the Heavenly Court.

Until the official announcement, none of the experts present were willing to prematurely reveal the outcome.

Director Gao, who had been listening intently to the debate, wore a complex expression.

In his heart, he felt deep regret regardless of whether Ping Han or Zhang Yu failed to secure the Military Certificate.

Hearing of Ping Han's likely defeat, his regret intensified, overshadowing much of his joy at Zhang Yu's probable victory.

He knew this was Ping Han's last chance.

Outside the examination hall.

Su Yanyang emerged, looking weak and filled with regret. The thought of selling his Jade Nectar Coins early only fueled his frustration.

Just then, he spotted Zhang Yu being carried out of the hall, receiving treatment from a Righteous God. Seeing Zhang Yu's mangled, bloodied state, Su Yanyang suddenly felt a surge of satisfaction.

"To be so badly injured by a mere Yellow Turban Warrior's attack?" he sneered inwardly. "That overconfident fool — a third-year student attempting the Military Certificate Examination?"

Serves him right! Su Yanyang thought smugly.

Suddenly, a wave of murderous intent swept through the air, startling Su Yanyang. He turned to see Xiao Yunji approaching, having reverted to her human form. Her face was twisted with rage, her teeth gritted, and her Bionic armor twitched as if possessed by a malevolent consciousness.

Su Yanyang silently retreated a few steps, putting as much distance between himself and Xiao Yunji as possible. Did this woman... sell her Jade Nectar Coins too? he wondered.

At that moment, Ping Han walked into view, drawing the attention of the crowd. Su Yanyang stared at Ping Han's unscathed appearance and calm demeanor, unable to resist asking, "Did you sell your Jade Nectar Coins?"

Ping Han smiled faintly. "Join my coaching group to see my portfolio allocation!"

"But since I'm in a good mood today, I'll give you a free peek!"

As he spoke, Su Yanyang's Bionic Eye was already displaying the screenshots Ping Han had sent.

Su Yanyang sighed inwardly, "This guy... doesn't he feel even a shred of doubt?"

Ping Han continued, "Junior Brother Su, you can't succeed in crypto trading without enduring countless losses and repeatedly tempering your Dao Heart!"

"If you're interested, join my coaching group. I share my experience and demonstrate my trades daily!"

Su Yanyang repeatedly examined the profit screenshots Ping Han had sent, and the idea of joining the group now appealed to him.

Meanwhile, Xiao Yunji showed no interest in crypto trading. She stared directly at Ping Han and coldly asked, "What was your formation core integrity at the end?"

Ping Han casually replied, "100%, I suppose!"

Hearing this, Xiao Yunji's eyes dimmed, realizing her chances of winning were now zero.

The other candidates looked enviously at Ping Han, thinking that this genius who had made a fortune in crypto trading would likely secure the Military Certificate this time as well.
