# Chapter 481: Civil Engineering Can Truly Produce Dragons!

True Monarch Magnetic Pole was merely a Spirit Realm Projection, lacking Magic Power. She needed to rely on Talismans to interact with the material world.

With a Talisman, she conjured a fierce gale, first dispersing the smoke and dust that still lingered over the competition arena.

Then, she sent a message to Zhang Yu: "My dear disciple, where are you?"

In the next moment, True Monarch Magnetic Pole activated another Talisman, unleashing a surge of divine power that swept across the arena, revealing the hidden figures within.

As the gale roared and the dust cleared, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, highlighted in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's vision, slowly materialized.

Then, Wen Wuya approached Zhang Yu, causing shockwaves to ripple through the countless students of Heavenly Sword University.

Seeing Wen Wuya reach for Zhang Yu's hand, Bai Zhenzhen's brow furrowed. She glared at Wen Wuya and demanded, "What are you doing here?"

Wen Wuya smiled faintly. "We're all good friends. I came to congratulate Zhang Yu on his competition victory."

Bai Zhenzhen snorted coldly. Without a visible movement, a crimson sword qi materialized in the air and slashed out, forcing Wen Wuya to retreat several steps.

Wen Wuya stared at the scene in surprise, turning to Bai Zhenzhen. "Zhenzhen, what kind of sword qi is that? I've never seen you use it before. Could it be...?"

Bai Zhenzhen frowned slightly, remaining silent. "Trouble..." she thought to herself. "The Extreme Emotion Sword Dao cultivation level increased, triggering it automatically."

"Born of emotion, extinguished by emotion, moving with the heart, striking with the heart... The Demonic Path is just that — demonic. The more you cultivate it, the harder it becomes to control. A single thought arises, and without even expending Magic Power, it can instantly kill someone."

With that thought, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but glare at Zhang Yu, inwardly blaming him for leading her down the Demonic Path.

Hearing Wen Wuya's question, Bai Zhenzhen scoffed. "None of your business. Stay away if you don't want to get cut."

Wen Wuya didn't move, only smiled faintly. "Zhenzhen, I understand that your sword dao cultivation... sometimes makes it hard to control your emotions. Don't worry, I'm a generous person. I won't hold it against you."

With that, Wen Wuya turned his willow-like waist toward Zhang Yu, winking with his bright eyes as he sent a message: "Let's chat properly when we have the chance."

Wen Wuya: I'm particularly interested in how you achieved your breakthrough. [Heart emoji]

Meanwhile, since Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had appeared together, the numerous Heavenly Sword University students observing the scene were mentally shaken. Wen Wuya's arrival only intensified their shock and disbelief.

Whether in the audience stands or among the Competition Team, the students' hearts surged with turmoil.

In Kunxu, academic excellence equated to superiority, high rankings signified power, and wealth meant beauty, intelligence, nobility, and being damn well superior to the rest, deserving the sincere admiration of the impoverished masses below.

But who were Bai Zhenzhen and Wen Wuya? They were disciples of Soul Transformation cultivators, the Academic Overachievers among Academic Overachievers, ranking at the top in grades, rankings, and wealth. Countless students idolized them, even treating them as living legends.

Yet now, these two revered figures were surrounding a Civil Engineering student from another university? And the Civil Engineering student was even holding the Heavenly Chosen's hand? Did he even realize what he was doing? The countless students present were instantly stirred with emotion.

"Let go! Let go! Bai Zhenzhen, let go of him! I haven't even touched your sword qi, so why does this Civil Engineering student get to hold your hand?!"

"Why is Wen Wuya here too? Don't go over there! How is this any different from being splattered with a Vocational College student's blood?!"

"Gah! Bai Zhenzhen is making a move! They're actually fighting over Zhang Yu! We're all Civil Engineering students — what makes Zhang Yu so special?!"

Meanwhile, Yue Guanqiong stared wide-eyed at the scene, feeling even worse than when he had just lost the competition.

His mind raced back to the intelligence reports about Zhang Yu's breakthrough.

"Was it the Yin Artifact Experiment? The Dual Cultivation techniques? Is it because Zhang Yu crossed over from the Civil Engineering Realm to the Dual Cultivation Realm?"

At that moment, watching Zhang Yu standing between two Flying Sword Heavenly Chosen, bathed in Wen Wuya's gentle gaze and with Bai Zhenzhen's right hand clamped tightly around his, Yue Guanqiong felt as if the other man was radiating light.

"I need to learn Dual Cultivation too! Dual Cultivation is the best path for Civil Engineering students!"

Yue Guanqiong made a painful decision in his heart: "I don't want human-sword unity anymore. I'm going to learn Dual Cultivation!"

On the other side, the Myriad Laws University Competition Team — Su Yanyang, Xiao Yunji, and others — were equally stunned by the scene unfolding before them.

Xiao Yunji exclaimed in disbelief, "What's Zhang Yu's relationship with those two?"

Shi Huaiyu speculated, "Could this be the 'friend' Zhang Yu mentioned he wanted to meet at Heavenly Sword University?"

Su Yanyang clenched his fists, his heart burning with envy. "So it's not just Wen Wuya — even Bai Zhenzhen is cultivating with Zhang Yu now?"

The thought that Zhang Yu had deliberately lingered behind, and that he and Bai Zhenzhen might have used the smoke and dust as cover to cultivate together right on the competition grounds, shook Su Yanyang's Dao Heart with envy.

"No wonder Zhang Yu is so strong! Even with such opportunities, he still seizes every chance to cultivate. How could he not be powerful?"

"Damn it, I want to join them too!"

As the crowd's emotions surged, each member reacting with their own brand of shock, True Monarch Magnetic Pole frowned in the sky, silently warning herself, "These Heavenly Sword University students... are they deliberately getting close to Zhang Yu to spy on the secrets of the Yin Artifact Experiment?"

She immediately sent Zhang Yu a message: Aren't you going to back off?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: These two Heavenly Sword University students might be trying to use you to gather intelligence about the laboratory. Don't get too close to them, or they'll take advantage of you and steal information.

As the message sent, True Monarch Magnetic Pole prepared to activate the Talisman again, intending to immediately separate the two parties.

Just then, seven-colored radiance descended from the Spirit Realm like sunlight refracted through a prism, scattering across the mortal world.

Witnessing this grand and otherworldly phenomenon, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's heart tightened. "Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' Spirit Realm Projection?" she thought.

Simultaneously, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' voice echoed in Bai Zhenzhen's ears: Still not letting go? Do you want me to intervene?

Bai Zhenzhen released her grip on Zhang Yu's hand and decisively knelt, shouting to Divine Monarch Seven Emotions: Mother!

As she spoke, she tugged at Zhang Yu, seemingly urging him to kneel as well.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole glared at Zhang Yu, as if to say: "You wouldn't dare kneel, would you?"

At the same time, she sent Zhang Yu a message: What are you standing there for? What does Heavenly Sword University's family drama have to do with you? Back off now!

Just as Zhang Yu was at a loss, a beam of sword light materialized between him and Bai Zhenzhen.

No matter how tightly Bai Zhenzhen gripped Zhang Yu's hand, the sword light seemed to cleave through the space between them, forcibly separating the pair.

Simultaneously, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' voice echoed faintly in Bai Zhenzhen's ear: "I told you, address me as 'Master' in public."

Bai Zhenzhen glanced at the seven-colored radiance in the sky and sent a message: "Mom, my Extreme Emotion Sword Dao cultivation has just undergone a major breakthrough."

"I can't turn back now."

As Bai Zhenzhen read Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' reply, a burst of seven-colored light flashed across the sky, causing the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda behind True Monarch Magnetic Pole to tremble violently.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions snorted coldly and sent a private message to True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "What are you gawking at? What does Heavenly Sword University's internal affairs have to do with you? Back off already!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole's gaze sharpened slightly as she read the message. "That old hag... repeating my words. Was she eavesdropping on my messages just now?"

A moment later, she smiled faintly to herself. "As expected of a seasoned Soul Transformation cultivator. Even her projection carries the power of her Primordial Spirit."

Abandoning her attempt to peer into the Divine Monarch's affairs with the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda, she flickered through space and reappeared directly before Zhang Yu.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "What are you staring at? Get moving."

Zhang Yu hadn't been staring blankly. The moment the Seven-Colored Radiance appeared, he had immediately switched the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo (Spiritual Root) in his Dao Seed Register to the Third Eye Mystic Power (Spiritual Root).

As soon as Zhang Yu made this switch, half of the Divine Spiritual Root that had been fused into a single entity within Bai Zhenzhen's Dantian instantly vanished.

The wondrous sensations that had arisen from the fusion of the two Divine Spiritual Roots disappeared, replaced by an overwhelming sense of emptiness that surged through her heart.

Yet, realizing what had happened, Bai Zhenzhen felt a wave of relief.

Though she didn't understand how Zhang Yu had done it, at least she no longer had to worry about their secret being exposed.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Sigh, how did Divine Monarch Seven Emotions get here so quickly? I wonder what effect the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo had on A-Zhen's body in such a short time... What influence did her Divine Spiritual Root exert on it? And what impact did it have on her?"

Despite his burning curiosity, Zhang Yu dared not switch back to the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo (Spiritual Root) for fear of triggering uncontrollable consequences.

Urged by True Monarch Magnetic Pole, Zhang Yu reluctantly left the arena, sending a message to his companion as he departed.

Zhang Yu: A-Zhen, I'm leaving now. I'll contact you later.

Bai Zhenzhen: She won't contact you again.

Zhang Yu's heart jolted. "Divine Monarch Seven Emotions?" he thought.

On the other side, Bai Zhenzhen watched Zhang Yu's retreating figure as True Monarch Magnetic Pole led him away. She sent a message: "Yu Zi, go ahead. I'll contact you once I've finished up here."

Zhang Yu: Heavenly Sword University, please ensure your staff no longer disturb my laboratory personnel.

Bai Zhenzhen paused, thinking, "Was that True Monarch Magnetic Pole beside him? Did she intercept my message?"

At that moment, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' voice echoed in Bai Zhenzhen's mind: "Return to your dormitory. We'll discuss your matter later."

The Divine Monarch's attention shifted to Wen Wuya standing nearby. "And what's your story?" she asked coolly.

Wen Wuya had approached Zhang Yu solely because of Myriad Laws University's backing and their breakthroughs in Dual Cultivation and Yin Artifact technology.

Based on her experience, intuition, and understanding of her Master, Divine Monarch Heavenly Star, she was certain her Master would be keenly interested in this matter.

Moreover, between Myriad Laws University and Joyful Union University, she believed Divine Monarch Heavenly Star would likely side with Myriad Laws University, as it promised greater wealth and profits.

Wen Wuya had initially assumed Divine Monarch Seven Emotions shared a similar perspective, but the recent series of events shattered that assumption.
