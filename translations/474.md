# Chapter 474: Zhang Yu's Date

Wen Wuya was deeply intrigued by the rumored breakthroughs in Dual Cultivation and Yin Artifact technology at Myriad Laws University.

On one hand, he recognized the far-reaching implications such advancements could have.

On the other hand...

Wen Wuya turned to watch Bai Zhenzhen practicing her sword techniques. "Given Zhang Yu's close relationship with Zhenzhen, she must already know about his involvement in the experiments and the upgrades to his Cultivation Art, right?"

In the training arena, Bai Zhenzhen's figure flickered amidst a storm of sword shadows as she battled five Flying Swords simultaneously.

Wen Wuya focused on her face, observing her unwavering focus and fierce determination.

Judging solely by her expression, one would never guess she harbored any emotions beyond the heat of combat.

"Could Zhang Yu, having participated in the Yin Artifact experiments, have applied some of that technology to A-Zhen?"

Wen Wuya wasn't some outdated traditionalist ignorant of Dual Cultivation techniques.

Having confirmed the depth of Zhang Yu's connection with Bai Zhenzhen, and recalling their simultaneous disappearance after their last meeting at Myriad Laws University, he began to suspect...

"These two... they're probably secretly training together like crazy."

Wen Wuya wasn't a petty ancient. He didn't mind the possibility of Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen engaging in Dual Cultivation together.

He was simply wondering if Zhang Yu, upon reuniting with Bai Zhenzhen at Heavenly Sword University, would seize the opportunity to cultivate with her and perhaps even apply some new techniques.

"If only I could closely observe their progress..."

With this thought, Wen Wuya resolved to keep a close watch on the pair, determined not to miss a single detail.

However, another concern lingered in his mind.

"Zhang Yu might not have learned any new techniques during the experiment. Even if he did, he might be restricted by confidentiality agreements from using them."

"The best way to gauge his true progress is to observe his performance in the upcoming competition. We need to confirm whether he has truly elevated his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to level 16, as Myriad Laws University claims."

With this thought, Wen Wuya's consciousness plunged into the Spirit Realm, swiftly navigating the endless torrent of information.

"Let me see... where exactly is our university's Civil Engineering Department?"

Wen Wuya genuinely didn't know the location of Heavenly Sword University's Civil Engineering Department or who was enrolled there.

After considerable effort and numerous inquiries, she finally used the Spirit Realm Projection Sutra to appear before Yue Guanqiong, the top student in the Civil Engineering Department at Heavenly Sword University.

Yue Guanqiong stared at Wen Wuya, his eyes fixed on the man's major and ranking displayed above his head. "Wen Wuya from the Flying Sword Communication Engineering program?" he thought in surprise.

What is the most crucial aspect of Flying Sword Arts?

Some argue it's the material of the Flying Sword itself — it must be sharp enough and durable enough to withstand extreme high-speed environments.

Others believe it's the swordsmanship used to wield the blade, maximizing and even surpassing the Flying Sword's potential. With the right skill, even a piece of wood or a stone could unleash earth-shattering power.

Still others insist that the most vital element is the forging technique, capable of producing more advanced and adaptable Flying Swords for various purposes.

If you were to ask Yue Guanqiong from Heavenly Sword University's Civil Engineering Department...

"The fact that Flying Sword Communication Engineering is one of Heavenly Sword University's flagship programs demonstrates the importance of communication in Flying Sword technology."

"As long as you can remotely control a Flying Sword across thousands of miles and lock onto targets beyond the horizon, it doesn't matter whether you're using a Flying Sword, a throwing knife, or even a needle — they're all equally formidable."

Wen Wuya, the ace student in Flying Sword Communication Engineering and a future contender for the Ten Great Leagues, was the elite of the elite.

Yue Guanqiong gazed at Wen Wuya and asked, "Student Wuyai, is there something you need?"

Wen Wuya briefly explained the situation with Zhang Yu and then asked, "You've observed Zhang Yu before. What do you think of his strength?"

Yue Guanqiong pondered for a moment before replying carefully, "I watched his battle against Vajra University last month. His Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power was only at level 10."

"If it's now at level 16... unless he was concealing his true strength. But given his training history, that seems unlikely."

Wen Wuya nodded. "In this competition, I want you to force Zhang Yu to reveal his full potential. Let's see how far his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power has truly progressed."

Yue Guanqiong smiled confidently, straightening his posture. "Rest assured, even if his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power is at level 16, I'm fully confident in my ability to defeat him."

Yue Guanqiong was brimming with self-assurance, but Wen Wuya remained skeptical of his guarantee.

After all, could a civil engineering student be reliable? Could their judgment be accurate? Could they guarantee victory in a competition?

Wen Wuya lightly tapped his finger, and projections of ten flying swords materialized before Yue Guanqiong.

"Choose one of these ten flying swords," Wen Wuya said. "Consider it a temporary loan for this competition."

Yue Guanqiong's gaze shifted slightly as he examined the array of flying sword projections. As his eyes lingered on each one, detailed information about it appeared.

To his astonishment, Yue Guanqiong discovered that all ten swords were military-grade models. He marveled inwardly, "Even a casual slip-up from a Soul Transformation disciple could overturn the results of our hard-fought competition."

Wen Wuya cared little about the outcome of the Civil Engineering Competition. Whether Zhang Yu won or lost, it wouldn't trouble him. After all, it was just a civil engineering competition.

His true motive was to satisfy his curiosity and gauge the current level of Zhang Yu's Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

After dismissing the Spirit Realm Projection, Wen Wuya turned toward Bai Zhenzhen and noticed she had already sheathed her sword, ended their sparring session, and seemed ready to leave the training grounds.

A thought struck him: "She's leaving a bit early today."

"Could Zhang Yu be on his way?"

With this thought, she sent Zhang Yu a message: "Where are you?"

Above Heavenly Sword University, Zhang Yu stood suspended in mid-air, gazing down at the University City below. Beside him hovered Su Yanyang, Shi Huaiyu, and others, each enveloped in a swirling aura of sword qi.

A Flying Sword floated beside each of them, continuously emitting streams of sword qi that propelled them through the Azure Void, allowing them to navigate the skies above Heavenly Sword University.

Zhang Yu had only realized upon arriving at the University City that flight was an essential skill in this cloud-piercing metropolis. The peaks and towers rising from the sea of clouds often lacked connecting pathways, making sword flight the sole means of traversing the city.

Fortunately, Heavenly Sword University offered numerous temporary Flying Sword rental points. After disembarking from the Flying Boat, Su Yanyang and his group each rented a sword for aerial travel.

These low-grade Flying Swords were slow and cumbersome, but their simple controls made them the most basic mode of transportation within the university.

As Zhang Yu navigated through the towering, sword-like mountains and skyscrapers that pierced the sea of clouds, he noticed that Heavenly Sword University had far fewer people outside compared to Myriad Laws University.

Not only were there fewer people, but even the advertisements and Spirit Realm Projections were less frequent than what Zhang Yu had seen at Myriad Laws University.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Heavenly Sword University certainly has a stronger immortal aura than Myriad Laws University."

In addition to the scarcity of Spirit Realm Projections, Zhang Yu also observed Flying Swords flashing across the sky from time to time, accompanied by thunderous booms and shockwaves.

Mo Shangjin explained in the Contest Group: "At Heavenly Sword University, the advanced Immortal Dao communication technology has drastically reduced the cost of Spirit Realm traffic, leading to highly developed applications in this field."

Mo Shangjin continued: "Students and teachers here are accustomed to online classes, Spirit Realm cultivation, and the solitary days of rigorous training within their dormitories."

Mo Shangjin added: "Even when practicing Flying Sword Arts, they often remain indoors, remotely controlling their Flying Swords for a few laps outside."

"Of course," Mo Shangjin said. "Wealthy students receive personal guidance from renowned masters and don't spend all their time in their dorms."

Listening to Mo Shangjin's explanation, Zhang Yu immediately thought of his Azure Silk Flying Sword and the eighty-four thousand Sky-Patrolling Flying Swords roaming the second level of Kunxu at Heavenly Sword University.

Just then, Zhang Yu received a message from Wen Wuya asking where he was.

After a moment's hesitation, Zhang Yu decided not to reply. He turned to Su Yanyang and the others and said, "You guys head to the arena first. A high school classmate of mine got into Heavenly Sword University, and I want to meet up with her."

Watching Zhang Yu's retreating figure, Shi Huaiyu remarked, "Meeting a high school classmate? It seems Zhang Yu is quite close to her."

Su Yanyang chuckled inwardly. "A high school classmate? More likely he's going to see Wen Wuya."

He recalled Wen Wuya's Spirit Realm Projection appearing beside Zhang Yu at their last gathering, as well as the rumors surrounding the Soul Transformation disciple and Zhang Yu.

"Is he trying to squeeze in a quick meeting between matches?" Su Yanyang wondered.

Meanwhile, on the other side...

Zhang Yu flew past a series of mountain peaks, his gaze sweeping over the dense clusters of buildings clinging to their slopes.

Finally, he unleashed the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, descending toward a cluster of dilapidated structures.

After navigating a maze of deserted alleys, passing a junkyard of discarded Flying Swords, and traversing a long-abandoned tunnel, Zhang Yu entered the mountain's interior. Following a winding path, he arrived at a secluded underground space.

The moment he stepped inside, Zhang Yu spotted a striking and familiar figure in the distance.

With a burst of speed, he surged forward, leaving trails of displaced air in his wake, and embraced her tightly.

"A-Zhen!"

But the next instant, Zhang Yu sensed something was wrong. The feel of the embrace was completely off.

Though the figure resembled her from afar and wore the same clothes, its size, texture, and scent were entirely different.

The only reason it felt familiar was that Zhang Yu himself had personally designed this figure's appearance.

"Wen Wuya!" Zhang Yu abruptly released the figure and retreated hastily.

"What are you doing here? Why are you wearing A-Zhen's clothes? And why have you concealed your Spirit Realm Projection?"

Wen Wuya smiled faintly at Zhang Yu. "So Zhenzhen really did come to meet you?"

"Don't be nervous. I'm not here to interfere with your reunion."

While tracking Bai Zhenzhen, Wen Wuya had suddenly wondered: "Is observation truly my only option?"

Looking at Zhang Yu, she smiled gently. "I've come to join you."

"Would you mind if I attended your meeting later?"

"I can pay you."
