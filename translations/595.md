# Chapter 595: Reunion with Bai Zhenzhen

"Kuang Tianqing has actually received guidance from eight Divine Monarchs across the Four Great Colleges?"

Yan Qianji stared at Kuang Tianqing, who stood proudly before him, listening to her words with shock. "How did she manage that?"

"No, for eight Divine Monarchs to tutor her together, she couldn't have achieved this alone."

"It wasn't her choosing the eight Divine Monarchs; it was the eight Divine Monarchs choosing her."

The realization dawned on Yan Qianji. "Heavenly Demon, White Bone, Netherworld, Joyous Union... This is a united front. Their collaboration runs far deeper than ever before."

"Even... even nurturing Kuang Tianqing together, to support her in winning the championship?"

Yan Qianji's heart sank at this thought. In comparison, the alliance between Myriad Laws, Heavenly Sword, Vajra, and Immortal Soldiers seemed far weaker.

"Compared to them, we're merely sharing resources. In reality, we're still largely competing with each other."

Yan Qianji let out a bitter laugh. The Ten Greats League hadn't even officially begun, yet his side was already subtly falling behind.

Meanwhile, on the other side, Wen Wuya watched Kuang Tianqing, now standing high above, and couldn't suppress the envy in her eyes.

To be guided by eight Divine Monarchs simultaneously — what kind of privilege was this?

Just imagining it made Wen Wuya tremble with excitement.

But when she considered her own inability to even manage her own Master, she felt the gap between herself and Kuang Tianqing widen even further.

"Both my Master and I have lost..."

"I am no match for Kuang Tianqing, and my Master is no match for Kuang Tianqing's Master either."

Dao Qiankun's gaze toward Kuang Tianqing was equally grave, feeling an unprecedented pressure from her imposing aura.

"This woman..."

As Kuang Tianqing's predatory eyes locked onto him, Dao Qiankun thought grimly, "She sees me as prey too."

"Is she trying to drain my cultivation through the Dual Cultivation Path?"

"If we had faced each other directly, the outcome would have been uncertain."

"But a dual cultivation duel is like dragging me onto a track I'm unfamiliar with, where she can exploit her superior experience and advanced Immortal Dao Technology to defeat me."

"I absolutely cannot let her drag me onto that track..."

On the other side, Zhang Yu gazed at Kuang Tianqing's seductive figure, but his mind drifted to another question.

"Joyful Union University... guidance from a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch?"

"Did Kuang Tianqing also receive guidance from Divine Monarch Jade Nectar?"

Zhang Yu recalled information about Divine Monarch Jade Nectar, the Five Taxes of Heavenly Beings, and Mighty Reincarnations.

He remembered the Evil Gods' past statements: Divine Monarch Jade Nectar had used her Immortal Dao Technology to help many sect members store their cultivation, which would be returned to them upon reincarnation, thus evading the Five Taxes of Heavenly Beings and similar reincarnation taxes.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Could Kuang Tianqing be a Mighty Reincarnation? Is her claim of receiving guidance from eight great Divine Monarchs just a pretext to conceal her tax evasion?"

Unable to confirm this, Zhang Yu kept his suspicions to himself.

From Kuang Tianqing's aura, Zhang Yu felt an even heavier pressure.

"Kuang Tianqing, Dao Qiankun... the competitors in the Ten Greats League are truly becoming stronger and stronger."

"To claim first place..."

At that moment, Zhang Yu couldn't help but waver.

"Can I really take first place?"

"Defeat monsters like Dao Qiankun and Kuang Tianqing... and take first place?"

Meanwhile, Kuang Tianqing, now aided by the eight Divine Monarchs, seemed to radiate an overwhelming aura, surpassing all others present.

As her gaze swept across the crowd, students instinctively retreated, causing Kuang Tianqing's smile to widen.

But in the next instant, a crimson sword qi suddenly erupted skyward. Amidst the crowd's shock, surprise, and confusion, it slashed directly toward Kuang Tianqing's position.

With a casual wave, Kuang Tianqing shattered the sword qi as if swatting a fly. She turned an intrigued gaze toward the swordsman, saying, "Oh? I didn't expect there to be someone even remotely decent among you Immortal Scum, besides Dao Qiankun."

As she spoke, data flashed across her Bionic Eye, displaying the attacker's name, school, grades, and even information about the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao and Divine Monarch Seven Emotions.

Kuang Tianqing said calmly, "Bai Zhenzhen of Heavenly Sword University."

Under the crowd's watchful eyes, Bai Zhenzhen met her gaze without flinching, crimson sword qi seemed to swirl slowly within her eyes.

"All this gibberish is making me want to cut you down," Bai Zhenzhen said coldly.

"Whether your Soul Transformation experts from those schools are taking bribes for extra lessons or exploiting students for profit, none of them have time for proper cultivation. Which disciple hasn't trained alongside their masters?"

"You're just throwing money at Soul Transformation experts to make them work for you. Anyone would think the Soul Transformation experts are paying you to abuse them!"

Wen Wuya, standing nearby, felt a jolt of shock and sighed helplessly, "The Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is far too reckless."

Zhang Yu, watching from a short distance away, found himself recalling the memory of the high school girl who had stood beside him against the oppression of the city's wealthy elite. She had defied fate, determined to enter one of the Ten Greats universities.

As he gazed at Bai Zhenzhen, a faint smile unconsciously crept across Zhang Yu's lips. "A-Zhen... this time, we'll fight these rich bastards together again."

Bai Zhenzhen's words seemed to instantly defuse much of the overwhelming pressure that had been bearing down on the crowd. The students straightened their backs, their gazes hardening as they met Kuang Tianqing's glare without flinching.

Kuang Tianqing paused slightly, then her Magic Power surged, causing the surrounding Spirit Realm to shift. The students present felt their magical artifacts and Bionics begin to destabilize, as if on the verge of losing control.

"Bai Zhenzhen..." Kuang Tianqing chuckled. "Your strength may not be the greatest, but your courage is admirable. I'll remember you."

"If you come find me tonight, I'll gladly guide you in your cultivation for free."

"The experience of tasting the heir to the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao... now that's something that truly interests me."

With a swift flick of her finger, Kuang Tianqing activated a Talisman in the air.

Friendship Talisman!

As the Talisman activated, Kuang Tianqing forcibly established friendships with everyone present.

She chuckled coquettishly, turning to address the others. "And you other dregs of the Immortal Dao... if you can satisfy my demands, I wouldn't mind giving you some guidance either."

With that, Kuang Tianqing lost interest in the crowd and turned to leave.

As she departed, the students gradually dispersed, each seeking accommodations for the night.

Ye Xingli sent Zhang Yu a message: "The teams from each school have been assigned separate rest areas. Come with us."

Just then, a voice called out to Zhang Yu.

"Yu Zi!"

Zhang Yu turned to see Bai Zhenzhen smiling as she approached him, Wen Wuya following beside her, also gazing at him with curiosity.

However, Bai Zhenzhen stopped about ten meters away from Zhang Yu.

Around her, crimson sword qi surged back and forth, mirroring the tumultuous emotions in her mind, which she struggled to control.

"Yu Zi," Bai Zhenzhen said with a helpless smile, "I can't get any closer. If I do, I'm afraid..."

Without a word, Zhang Yu took a step forward and silently walked toward Bai Zhenzhen.

Bai Zhenzhen instinctively recoiled. "No, Yu Zi! I'm not myself right now..."

"It's okay," Zhang Yu replied as golden Body-Protecting Qi materialized around him.

The Formless Cloud Gang, enhanced by the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill and fortified by multiple cultivation arts, had maximized his defensive capabilities.

As Zhang Yu drew nearer, the sword qi around Bai Zhenzhen grew increasingly turbulent, slashing at him like raging waves.

The surging tide of sword qi intensified, mirroring the fervor in the girl's heart, pressing urgently toward Zhang Yu as if to embrace him.

Amidst the crisp clinking of colliding sword qi, Zhang Yu stepped forward, one stride at a time, until he stood before Bai Zhenzhen. Smiling, he said, "A-Zhen, we've finally made it into the Ten Greats League together."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded. "Yu Zi, I knew you'd catch up eventually."

Zhang Yu mentally assessed the consumption of his Body-Protecting Qi and Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill, thinking to himself, "If I have to keep resisting sword qi of this intensity, the Spirit Coin drain will be significant."

"If I get any closer and trigger even more intense sword qi, I'll likely have to use military-grade defenses, which will cost even more Spirit Coins."

"I need to be richer... I absolutely must be richer to stay close to A-Zhen and always be with her."

As Zhang Yu mentally calculated the cost of staying near Bai Zhenzhen, Wen Wuya watched from the sidelines as the surging sword qi completely engulfed their figures. She could barely glimpse Zhang Yu's Gang Qi, a faint golden flame struggling to burn against the crimson torrent of sword qi.

"Extreme Emotion Sword Dao... truly a Demonic Path", Wen Wuya thought to herself.

"How can anyone tolerate this constant barrage of sword qi?"

"Even a simple conversation requires this level of defense. If things escalated further... what kind of chaos would that unleash?"

Meanwhile, the commotion quickly drew the attention of others.

A shimmering diagram depicting the sun, moon, and stars abruptly unfolded across the sky. Air currents, temperature, humidity, spiritual energy, gravity — all environmental parameters began to fluctuate violently.

"Bai Zhenzhen, what do you think you're doing?" Ye Xingli shouted. "Stop this at once!"

Following Ye Xingli's lead, Yan Qianji, Nine Heavens Liu, and other Myriad Laws University students rushed to the scene.

Wen Wuya immediately led the Heavenly Sword University students to block their path, saying, "Rest assured, they haven't started fighting yet..."

Dao Qiankun, however, frowned slightly. Having formed a favorable impression of Zhang Yu, he couldn't stand by and watch the Heavenly Sword University students attack him so relentlessly.

"Who dares harm the Heavenly Chosen of Myriad Laws University?!"

Ignoring Wen Wuya's explanation, Dao Qiankun unleashed a palm strike across the void. Wisps of chaotic energy surged forth from thin air, coalescing into an invisible barrier between Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, completely isolating them from each other.

Simultaneously, the Void Calamity Transformation Diagram unfurled beneath Zhang Yu's feet, shielding him as he swiftly retreated toward Ye Xingli's position.
