# Chapter 628: A Great Upheaval Unseen in Ten Thousand Years

Kuang Tianqing cast a cold glance at Li Shiwei and said indifferently, "Dao Qiankun's death has nothing to do with me."

"I'd much rather kill that defeated opponent in the arena during the grand competition than kill him offstage."

Li Shiwei retorted sharply, "But you were the last person to see Dao Qiankun alive that night!"

Kuang Tianqing flicked her fingers dismissively. "I've already explained to the Patrol Team what I discussed with Dao Qiankun that night, and they've confirmed it had nothing to do with his death."

"If anyone still has complaints, they can take it up with your school's administration."

With that, Kuang Tianqing urged, "Hey? Can the auction resume now?"

Just as Dao Qiankun's corpse was about to be auctioned off again, a projection suddenly appeared, halting the funeral.

"My apologies, everyone. I'm personally purchasing Dao Qiankun's corpse in its entirety. I hope you'll give me face and refrain from participating in today's auction."

The crowd immediately recognized the projection's speaker as Dao Shuyi, Dao Qiankun's senior sect elder. Though only a Nascent Soul True Monarch, he was a contemporary of Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution and held significant power within the Myriad Paths Group, a colossal conglomerate.

Dao Shuyi's words caused ninety-nine percent of the attendees to abandon any intention of continuing the auction.

After Dao Shuyi's bidding, the remaining participants quickly fell silent.

Before leaving, Zhang Yu approached Dao Qiankun's corpse. Staring at the faint smile on the deceased man's face, he thought bitterly, "So much for changing the world and preserving your useful body... You're the first one to die."

"Now you can't even change the world, let alone become a Soul Cultivator."

Just as Zhang Yu was lamenting inwardly, a line of characters on Dao Qiankun's chest suddenly glowed faintly: "Descendant of an Immortal."

Ye Xingli, standing beside Zhang Yu, noticed his dazed expression and asked, "Junior Brother?"

Zhang Yu immediately composed himself, thinking, "The Dao Seed is still visible? But... Brother Dao is dead, isn't he?"

"Could it be... Brother Dao isn't dead?"

As Zhang Yu gazed at Dao Qiankun's ruddy complexion, which made him look as if he might open his eyes at any moment, the man's words echoed clearly in his mind:

"You can also flee behind me. I will do my best to protect you."

---

At that moment, Zhang Yu felt a surge of curiosity — a curiosity he himself found absurd, reckless, and childish. He wondered what would happen if he hid behind Brother Dao right now.

But glancing at the surrounding crowd and the wall Brother Dao was leaning against, Zhang Yu knew there was no opportunity to act on his impulse.

"Besides, how could Brother Dao still be alive?" he thought. "His condition was definitely examined by a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch. If they declared him dead, he must be dead."

Zhang Yu mused, "Instead of doubting Brother Dao's death, perhaps I should ask... does the Dao Seed Register specify that the host must be alive?"

"Or could some Dao Seeds — like this Immortal Descendant — function even in a corpse?"

Zhang Yu couldn't be sure if his speculation was correct. Yet as he gazed at Dao Qiankun's corpse before him, a deep sense of reluctance stirred within him.

Just then, a voice called out, "You're Zhang Yu, aren't you?"

Zhang Yu turned to see Dao Shuyi's projection.

Noticing the lingering reluctance in Zhang Yu's eyes, Dao Shuyi said, "I've heard about you."

"For the next while, I'll be temporarily storing Dao Qiankun's corpse on his Flying Boat. If you wish, you can go keep him company."

Zhang Yu exclaimed in surprise, "Ah?"

Dao Shuyi casually remarked, "I've heard you're a man of genuine sentiment, embodying the spirit of ancient cultivators. My junior nephew also carries a classical air in his actions. If he knew a friend would come to pay respects after his death, he would surely be pleased."

Zhang Yu nodded in agreement. "Thank you, Senior Dao. I do wish to spend more time with Senior Dao Qiankun."

As they left, Ye Xingli commented, "It seems Senior Dao Shuyi is also a traditionalist. Securing Brother Dao's corpse might stem from a desire to honor the past, rather than any profit motive."

"A traditionalist?" Zhang Yu knew the term referred to cultivators who clung to ancient customs and beliefs, deeply influenced by the old era and even advocating for certain ancient practices.

"That's understandable," he mused. "After all, many cultivators are essentially living relics of the past."

"But even traditionalists only embrace certain aspects of the past," he added. "They can't fully revert to ancient ways."

"In Kunxu," he thought, "only the wealthy can afford to be traditionalists. Without money, you have no right to cling to the past."

As Zhang Yu and his companions left the funeral, they spotted Kuang Tianqing giving an interview outside.

A reporter asked Kuang Tianqing, "Student Kuang, what are your thoughts on Dao Qiankun's suicide?"

Kuang Tianqing replied calmly, "I feel sorry for him. He didn't live to witness the dawn of the new era."

The reporter's eyes lit up, sensing a major scoop. "What do you mean by 'new era'?"

Kuang Tianqing smiled proudly. "After securing first place in this year's Ten Greats League, I will choose the 《Eternal Spring Sutra》 from the Immortal Sect Techniques."

"This cultivation art grants ten thousand years of longevity."

"I will dedicate myself to mastering this technique and developing more affordable longevity methods."

"Before long, every cultivator below the tenth layer will be able to extend their lifespan by at least three hundred years."

"Everyone will have more time to earn wealth, more time to cultivate, and more opportunities to strive for the Immortal Dao..."

Kuang Tianqing's words reverberated through the Spirit Realm like a thunderclap, completely overshadowing Dao Qiankun's death and silencing all other voices in the University Realm. They sparked countless debates and discussions.

Hearing Kuang Tianqing's declaration, Ye Xingli's gaze sharpened. "With Brother Dao gone and no one to challenge Kuang Tianqing, the Four Heavenly Demon Schools' plan has a much higher chance of success now."

"If they truly obtain the Ten Thousand Years Longevity Method, the University Realm will face unprecedented upheaval, the likes of which haven't been seen in millennia, perhaps even ten thousand years."

Meanwhile, Kuang Tianqing, still being interviewed, suddenly turned her head and smiled faintly at Zhang Yu.

A message from her appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye:

Kuang Tianqing: Dao Qiankun is dead. There's no one left to protect you in the arena.

Kuang Tianqing: If I were you, I'd seize every moment to cultivate and stop wasting time on pointless things like this.

Kuang Tianqing: At least that way, you might still provide me with some amusement in the future.

Zhang Yu: Kuang Runaway, who's fled twice already, why don't you wait until you can face me without running before talking big?

Kuang Tianqing laughed, her gaze deepening with meaning as she replied: Zhang Yu, as prey, you're becoming increasingly tempting.

Sensing the undisguised malice in her eyes, Zhang Yu ignored her.

He knew she was right about one thing: he truly needed to seize every moment to cultivate. With no certainty when the Ten Greats League would resume, each day spent cultivating might seem insignificant to others, but for him, who was cultivating the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture, every day brought significant progress.

Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture Level 12 (5/120)

That evening, shortly after Zhang Yu advanced the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture to Level 12, news arrived regarding the Ten Greats League.

"The finals are resuming tomorrow?"

Zhang Yu scanned the group chat logs, a flood of information appearing before his eyes. A thoughtful glint flashed in his gaze.

"According to many, the Four Myriad Laws Schools have been insisting on further postponement, demanding a new selection process to replace Dao Qiankun."

"Meanwhile, the Four Heavenly Demon Schools are pushing for the competition to continue, proposing to promote a student from the eliminated ranks."

"In the end, the Heavenly Court silenced all disputes, ordering the Ten Greats League to proceed."

Just then, Director Gao's communication request appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

Director Gao: "Zhang Yu, I've heard about everything. Are you alright? The upcoming matches will likely be increasingly dangerous. Please be careful."

Director Gao's face was etched with concern as he continued, "Recently... at the 666th layer, massive quantities of supplies have been entering and exiting daily, including vast amounts of food and nutritional materials."

"Zhang Yu, your area is likely to become the eye of the storm. You must be extremely cautious."

Zhang Yu's heart stirred. He remembered that the 666th floor was where Vice-Principal of Myriad Laws, Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations, stored his physical body.

Zhang Yu had once visited the Divine Monarch there with True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

"Are they placing massive food orders there? Does this mean Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations is about to make a move?" Zhang Yu wondered.

Director Gao continued, "I wanted to consult True Monarch Magnetic Pole about the situation, but she suddenly went into seclusion for artifact refinement, cutting off all external contact."

Director Gao's voice deepened. "Whatever happens next, she won't be able to help you."

"If you..."

Director Gao hesitated, his tone tinged with reluctance and resignation. "If you run into trouble, seek out that woman."

"That woman?" Zhang Yu asked, puzzled.

"Bai Zhenzhen," Director Gao replied. "Aren't you two on good terms?"

Zhang Yu glanced at Director Gao in surprise. He remembered how the director had always disapproved of his close relationship with Bai Zhenzhen.

Yet now, Director Gao was saying, "If you encounter any insurmountable problems there, turn to her."

"After all, her master is Divine Monarch Seven Emotions. She has some skills."

The next morning, all thirty finalists arrived at the venue.

Dao Qiankun's vacant spot was filled by the strongest competitor from the seventh-ranked team in the second relay race — Mu Qiansi of Joyful Union University.

As ten Soul Transformation divine lights illuminated the sky in succession, the competition details and rules for the finals materialized above.
