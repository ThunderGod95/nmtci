# Chapter 622: The True Runaway Champion

First place: Nine Heavens Liu.

In the final registration area of the Underwater Race.

Nine Heavens Liu piloted his Divine Shuttle, creating countless illusory copies that swept through the vast registration area until he located the black registration sphere.

The full name of his vessel was the Nine Heavens Ten Earths Hazard-Avoiding Divine Shuttle, an ancient magical artifact refined through generations of upgrades and never surpassed.

From aristocratic clans and imperial families to renowned Immortal Dao sects... through every historical upheaval, every epochal shift, every fall of powerful houses or sects, and every eruption of war, conflict, and strife... the Nine Heavens Divine Shuttle had always been there, whisking away people and their fortunes.

The philosophy that "as long as you can escape quickly and survive, you'll always have a chance to recover your losses" had been passed down through generations and now formed the core tenet of the Finance Department, a principle Nine Heavens Liu wholeheartedly embraced.

The Divine Shuttle's status as the ultimate escape artifact stemmed not only from its ability to harness Qi Luck, its upgradeable configurations using accumulated resources, and its ease of monetization, but above all... its unparalleled speed.

"Speed is the paramount factor in evading danger."

"The Nine Heavens Divine Shuttle represents the pinnacle of speed within its tier."

Although he wasn't skilled in artifact refinement, Nine Heavens Liu could wield formidable control over artifacts through his Bionic. With the support of several Soul Cultivator masters, he skillfully piloted this Divine Shuttle.

Nine Heavens Liu understood that the Finance Department excelled at none of the core skills: artifact refinement, medicine, talismans, communication, transportation, construction, combat...

Yet, by leveraging the Finance Department's vast resources, he could acquire these capabilities, even directly reaping their benefits.

The tentacles of the Finance Department had long extended into every industry. With sufficient will, they could stir up storms in any field and challenge experts in any domain.

"This is the true power of the Finance Department."

"Because money is omnipotent."

"And the Finance Department is the most omnipotent discipline."

"With Kuang Tianqing and Dao Qiankun locked in their power struggle during this year's Ten Greats League... I might even have a chance to seize the championship."

"Though the risks are considerable."

Though he lacked specific inside information, Nine Heavens Liu could sense the Finance Departments of various schools stirring restlessly, as if plotting something in recent days.

Yet what exactly they were scheming remained a mystery. Each person saw only their fragment of the scheme, leaving Nine Heavens Liu unable to discern the full picture.

"I suppose only Master and the other Soul Transformation cultivators can see the full picture," Nine Heavens Liu mused, finishing the registration of the final black ball.

The final stretch of the stage lay ahead.

Just then, Nine Heavens Liu spotted a dragon shadow streaking toward him from the distance.

"Hmm?"

At first, he assumed Ying Zhoufan had caught up, but moments later, he realized it was Zhang Yu, standing proudly atop the dragon's head as he rode toward him.

"Oh? So they can still catch up like this?"

As Nine Heavens Liu watched in surprise, a Fish Monster suddenly lunged toward the dragon shadow, tossing two black balls into the air. The dragon and Zhang Yu caught them mid-flight, completing the registration in an instant.

"What?"

Seeing Zhang Yu, Ying Zhoufan, and himself now aligned at the same starting line, Nine Heavens Liu was startled. "They can pull off a move like that?"

But a moment later, he grinned. "Excellent."

Turning to the dragon and its rider, Nine Heavens Liu said, "I was just thinking this stage lacked excitement. Winning first place here wouldn't generate much buzz. Your arrival is perfect."

The dragon twisted its body, carrying Zhang Yu closer to Nine Heavens Liu.

Zhang Yu gazed at Nine Heavens Liu within the Divine Shuttle and said calmly, "Senior, we meet again."

Nine Heavens Liu chuckled. "Junior Brother, let's settle this on the final stretch. May the best man win."

As both competitors belonged to the Four Schools Alliance, neither attacked the other.

Zhang Yu knew that any attempt to obstruct the other would only anger the school authorities.

This meant the final leg of the race would be a pure test of speed between him and Nine Heavens Liu.

Nine Heavens Liu gazed at the youth atop the dragon's head, seemingly surprised that the Civil Engineering student who had once rejected his offer to transfer to the Finance Department had now risen to stand before him, qualified to compete on equal terms.

3!

A Spirit Realm Projection summoned by Nine Heavens Liu materialized in the water, displaying the countdown.

Nine Heavens Liu: "Junior Brother, I won't hold back in this final sprint."

2!

"If you can, try to chase me."

"Give it your all and try to get closer."

1!

As the number 1 appeared, both competitors surged forward, leaving long white trails in their wake. In an instant, they had burst out of the registration area, leaving behind a chaotic mess of turbulent currents.

The Nine Heavens Divine Shuttle surged ahead, its powerful force carving a vacuum tunnel through the water like a submerged torpedo.

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu, riding the dragon, felt an unparalleled smoothness as the water field expanding from his body synergized perfectly with Ying Zhoufan's water manipulation abilities.

Gazing at the Nine Heavens Divine Shuttle ahead, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Excellent... the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor and the power of monsterfolk dragon transformation complement each other perfectly. The water feels like an extension of our bodies."

"We can win this round."

Before the finish line of the Underwater Race.

Apart from the eleven contestants still racing, nearly all other participants had gathered here. Even the teachers from various schools were waiting, eager to see who would be the first to cross the finish line.

Many competitors who witnessed the fierce competition between Nine Heavens Liu and Zhang Yu exclaimed in awe.

Wen Wuya thought to himself, "How fast! Nine Heavens Liu has always been swift, and the Nine Heavens Divine Shuttle is exceptionally powerful. Whether flying through the air, diving into the earth, or racing underwater, it's always the fastest. But I never imagined Zhang Yu could match his speed after transforming into a dragon."

Dao Qiankun was watching a live feed of Zhang Yu and Nine Heavens Liu's clash on a screen, surrounded by his handpicked teammates: Yan Qianji, Li Shiwei from the Dao Techniques Department, and Wen Rongjue from the Finance Department.

As Nine Heavens Liu took the lead on the screen, Dao Qiankun smiled faintly. "Nine Heavens Liu is remarkably composed. He didn't even seize the early advantage; instead, he chose to begin his sprint alongside Zhang Yu. I wonder if this composure will last until the very end."

Li Shiwei, the second-ranked student in the Dao Techniques Department, had always idolized Dao Qiankun, her senior.

When she first heard Zhang Yu declare his intention to elevate Dao Qiankun to the throne, Li Shiwei's resentment burned fiercely.

"That's my line!" she inwardly roared.

Now, hearing Dao Qiankun's words, Li Shiwei asked in surprise, "Senior, do you think Zhang Yu will win?"

Dao Qiankun replied calmly, "There are no certainties in this world, but Zhang Yu certainly has a chance."

As they spoke, Nine Heavens Liu and Zhang Yu, one after the other, plunged into a deep sea trench. Their incredible speed caused the live feed to become chaotic and dark.

Watching this, Dao Qiankun snapped his fingers and declared, "Let's move to the VIP seats."

With a Spirit Coin transaction, a Spirit Realm Projection materialized in their Bionic Eyes. The environment around Dao Qiankun and his two teammates warped violently.

As if instantly teleported, they found themselves no longer at the finish line but right in the sea trench, hot on the heels of Nine Heavens Liu and Zhang Yu.

Li Shiwei thought to herself, "Is this a tracking shot combined with a Spirit Realm Projection? It's so immersive, like I'm right behind Nine Heavens Liu and Zhang Yu, watching their race firsthand."

Looking at Dao Qiankun, who was treating everyone to the spectacle, Li Shiwei thought, "As expected of Senior — treating people comes as naturally to him as breathing... so cool."

Just then, Dao Qiankun analyzed, "Nine Heavens Liu is gradually widening the gap. After all, Ying Zhoufan is still injured, so it's normal for his stamina to decline after running this far."

Li Shiwei asked, "Is Zhang Yu going to lose?"

Dao Qiankun replied, "For now, they're still in open water, giving Nine Heavens Liu a significant advantage. But the course will narrow considerably as they approach the final stretch, especially the underwater caves. The complex terrain there might allow Zhang Yu to close the gap."

Moments later, they watched as Nine Heavens Liu and Zhang Yu descended into the depths of the trench. Their figures flashed, arcing in elegant curves through the water, kicking up massive waves as they plunged into the adjacent underwater cave system.

Inside the cavern, Nine Heavens Liu's Divine Shuttle sped forward, maneuvering through the narrow underwater passages. Inevitably, its speed slowed.

"Hmph, Zhang Yu... If you think this complex terrain gives you an advantage, you're sorely mistaken."

"Spectral Shadow Transformation! Spirit Realm Pathfinding!"

Suddenly, illusory projections erupted from the Divine Shuttle, streaking outward in all directions. In an instant, they mapped vast stretches of the terrain.

As the terrain data streamed in, Nine Heavens Liu swiftly calculated and plotted the optimal route. Accelerating forward, he maintained the perfect speed along the ideal path.

"Intelligence is paramount for escape."

"Only by fully leveraging intelligence can one unleash true speed — that's the key to mastering escape. That's how you maintain peak velocity in any situation."

"Can you keep up, Zhang Yu?"

In Zhang Yu's mind, a complete three-dimensional model of the underwater cavern racecourse materialized.

His current position, along with that of the colossal dragon beneath him, glowed as a red dot, darting through the mental map at breakneck speed.

This was because Zhang Yu had previously dispatched Demon Beasts to scout the terrain, allowing him to construct the model and familiarize himself with the route beforehand.

"Incredible," Li Shiwei exclaimed in astonishment. "Even with the Spirit Realm camera tracking them, I can barely keep up. Are these two really first-timers here? But wait..."

Li Shiwei noticed with surprise, "Why does it feel like Zhang Yu and Nine Heavens Liu are drifting further apart?"

Dao Qiankun swiped his fingertip across the projection, instantly locking, popping up, and zooming in on a series of screenshots showing various collisions between the dragon body and the terrain.

Dao Qiankun explained, "The dragon body's massive size, combined with Ying Zhoufan's less refined control compared to Zhang Yu, means every collision at these extreme speeds causes significant deceleration, steadily increasing the distance between them. However..."

Inside the underwater cave, the Nine Heavens Divine Shuttle pulverized a patch of seaweed and darted through a massive cavern filled with towering stone pillars. Suddenly, a dragon shadow materialized close behind.

"Hmm?"

Nine Heavens Liu gazed at the figure atop the dragon's head, surprised. "He's caught up?"

---

Li Shiwei asked, puzzled, "How did Zhang Yu manage to catch up?"

Dao Qiankun calmly analyzed, "He compensated for Ying Zhoufan's mistakes using his own power."

"By leveraging the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, he subtly adjusted the terrain in advance, adapting it to the dragon body and minimizing collisions."

"To achieve this, he needed not only lightning-fast reflexes but also the ability to calculate both the optimal path and Ying Zhoufan's errors simultaneously."

Under the astonished gazes of his teammates, Dao Qiankun continued, "If Nine Heavens Liu was following the optimal route, then Zhang Yu... forged a new optimal route through sheer force."

---

Inside the undersea cave.

"Can't shake him off?" Nine Heavens Liu thought, glancing back at Zhang Yu who remained stubbornly close behind. "What a persistent pest."

---

Before the finish line.

Wen Wuya sighed in admiration. "The key to underwater speed lies either in raw power or in masterful water control."

"And with water control, the greater the range, the faster the speed."

"Zhang Yu controls water at close range with the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, at mid-range with dragon transformation, and at long range with the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, drastically expanding his control over the water."

"To achieve this on his first collaboration with Ying Zhoufan... truly remarkable!"

As the live broadcast footage sped by, showcasing the competitors' extraordinary techniques, students watching near the finish line gasped in awe.

Dao Qiankun, observing the increasingly narrow cave ahead, announced, "Here comes the final stretch — the most treacherous and complex segment of the race. This is where victory will be decided."

Meanwhile, more and more viewers who had been watching other racers now turned their attention to the duel between Zhang Yu and Nine Heavens Liu.

"Nine Heavens Liu is actually being dogged by Zhang Yu?"

"It's the result of Zhang Yu's collaboration with Ying Zhoufan."

"Collaboration? Zhang Yu tamed Ying Zhoufan and rode him all the way here!"

"Too fast! This is the ultimate underwater speed showdown. Who will win?"

---

Inside the underwater cavern, Nine Heavens Liu watched the massive dragon body try to squeeze through a nearby crevice to catch up, only to be swiftly outmaneuvered. "It's futile," he said. "I'm following the optimal route. Trying to bypass me through alternate paths will only slow you down further."

Behind the camera, Li Shiwei watched intently. "Another failure. It can't overtake him at all."

Dao Qiankun said calmly, "The final three hairpin turns will decide the victor."

*Bang!*

A deafening crash echoed through the underwater cave as the dragon body, once again trying to bypass the Divine Shuttle, collided with it.

Watching the two vessels accelerate away after the impact, Dao Qiankun's gaze sharpened. "Nine Heavens Liu's focus is faltering."

Under the tense scrutiny of his two teammates, Dao Qiankun stated calmly, "Pay close attention. The outcome hinges on this moment."

A momentary flicker of error from the Nine Heavens Divine Shuttle finally opened the optimal route.

A burst of flames erupted from the dragon body as the Heavenly Sun Radiance God surged from its tail, propelled by the dragon's grievous wounds. The combined force hurled the rider and dragon forward with terrifying momentum.

"This wasn't a mistake..." Nine Heavens Liu's mind remained icily calm. "I merely sought a more perfect route, one that transcends your current dimensional limitations."

"Nine Heavens Ten Earths Hazard-Avoiding Divine Shuttle! Burrow into the earth!"

As the Divine Shuttle radiated a layer of ethereal light, it shattered through mountains and rocks without slowing down, carving a more direct path toward the finish line.

With each massive impact, the shuttle's Magic Power reserves dwindled rapidly, and Nine Heavens Liu's own Magic Power burned fiercely, nearing exhaustion in an instant.

But the next moment, with a burst of light, the shuttle breached the ocean surface and surged across the finish line just before its Magic Power completely ran out.

"I made it," Nine Heavens Liu breathed a sigh of relief. As he glanced back at the dragon shadow struggling to break through the water behind him, a sudden shock struck him.

"Where is he?"

Zhang Yu's figure was nowhere to be seen on the massive dragon's blood-soaked body.

Yet Nine Heavens Liu didn't slow down; instead, he accelerated toward the finish line.

"Wherever he's gone, I'll cross the finish line first..."

But the next moment, as the Bionic Eye in his skull displayed the second-place ranking, Nine Heavens Liu froze in shock.

"What?"

"When did he overtake me?"

Nine Heavens Liu jerked his head up and saw Zhang Yu standing atop the Divine Shuttle. With a deafening roar, the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power activated, launching Zhang Yu like a cannonball from the shuttle. He shot across the finish line, securing first place by a hair's breadth.

As Nine Heavens Liu crossed the finish line in second place, his mind replayed the image of Zhang Yu, covered in blood, standing atop the Divine Shuttle.

"That madman... he jumped onto my Divine Shuttle?"

"A lunatic."
