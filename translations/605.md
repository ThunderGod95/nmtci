# Chapter 605: The Battlefield That Suits Me Best

Zhang Yu intended to draw Kuang Tianqing into his domain, into a battlefield of his own making.

During this process, he also aimed to recruit more allies.

Myriad Laws, Heavenly Sword, Vajra, Immortal Soldiers... all were on his target list.

Of course, Zhang Yu wasn't planning to have such a large group besiege Kuang Tianqing alone.

After all, Kuang Tianqing wasn't a fool, nor were the academic overachievers from the other universities. They wouldn't easily walk into such a crowded encirclement.

Zhang Yu understood that once the powerhouses from the four schools — Myriad Laws, Heavenly Sword, Vajra, and Immortal Soldiers — converged, the elite students from Kuang Tianqing's side — Heavenly Demon, Joyous Union, Netherworld, and White Bone — would inevitably begin to gather as well.

But this suited his plans perfectly.

"Among the hundred students participating in this Team Tournament, Kuang Tianqing possesses the most exceptional individual combat ability."

"Against an opponent with such overwhelming personal strength, the more crowded the battlefield becomes, the more her individual advantages will be diluted."

"Kuang Tianqing... I not only intend to drag her into my battlefield, but I also plan to bring in even more people to minimize the advantage of individual strength. Step by step... I will devour her popularity and influence."

But Zhang Yu knew that to draw more people into his battlefield, his own reputation alone would not suffice. He looked at Dao Qiankun before him, realizing that only by leveraging the latter's prestige could he truly achieve his goal.

Having made up his mind, Zhang Yu continued, "Wen Wuya's flying sword attacks are virtually invincible at long range, but after these strikes, transporting and guarding the prisoners becomes a massive problem."

"They need powerful allies on the front lines to help them secure the captives."

"And you, Senior... you're a top-tier powerhouse capable of contending with Kuang Tianqing. Under your leadership, the Myriad Laws School Team also possesses the greatest strength among the ten school teams, making them the ideal partners for this alliance."

Dao Qiankun nodded slightly, observing his junior brother before him. He hadn't expected the junior to voice all his own plans so openly.

He smiled faintly and said, "Continue."

Zhang Yu said, "Besides capturing prisoners on the battlefield, guarding them is crucial in this Team Tournament. Throughout the competition, prisoners can be seized by rival teams or rescued by their allies. To secure prisoners until the tournament's end and convert them into actual points, we need to establish a defensive stronghold to detain them — a fortress with great formations and fortifications."

"Formation techniques and Civil Engineering are my areas of expertise. By entrusting me with these logistical tasks, Senior, you and the powerhouses from Heavenly Sword and other universities can reduce the manpower allocated to guarding prisoners, allowing for greater freedom to engage in combat and capture more prisoners..."

Dao Qiankun glanced at Zhang Yu and said, "Yan Qianji can handle this too. He has experience building his own production lines and possesses considerable skills in Civil Engineering and formation deployment. Moreover... he's already completed most of it."

When the topic shifted to civil engineering skills, Zhang Yu's aura abruptly transformed.

He seemed to grow taller, meeting Dao Qiankun's gaze unflinchingly. With unwavering conviction, he declared, "Senior... just as your overall strength and combat prowess rank among the top tier in this 100-person Team Tournament — "

"My civil engineering capabilities also place me at the very pinnacle of this group."

"The civil engineering skills required to construct a factory... I mastered them back in my freshman year."

As Zhang Yu spoke, as if to validate his words, his Military Civil Engineering Certificate and Civil Engineering Competition Champion Certificate materialized one after another.

All of this seemed to convey a single message to Dao Qiankun: "I am the Civil Engineering Competition Champion from the ten universities. Civil engineering is my domain — even Yan Qianji would have to step aside here."

Dao Qiankun observed Zhang Yu and the certificates behind him, a faint smile playing on his lips. "You're right," he conceded. "This area is indeed your domain."

"Then the prisons for detaining the prisoners... I'll entrust them to you."

Hearing Dao Qiankun's words, Zhang Yu's heart surged with excitement. He knew his plan had succeeded, bringing Kuang Tianqing one step closer to his battlefield.

Simultaneously, combat footage flickered across the Bionic Eye in Dao Qiankun's eye socket.

Even as he spoke with Zhang Yu, he was simultaneously reviewing the combat videos Zhang Yu had recorded.

During this review, Dao Qiankun couldn't help but think, "In this battle, aside from Kuang Tianqing, Zhang Yu was the second person who constantly shifted the battlefield's momentum."

"Though his strength is limited, he undeniably influenced Kuang Tianqing."

Especially when Dao Qiankun saw Zhang Yu's final exchange with Kuang Tianqing, a flicker of light seemed to spark in his eyes.

"Within three days, I must capture Zhang Yu?", Dao Qiankun mused inwardly.

Dao Qiankun understood that with so many live viewers watching, Kuang Tianqing had to deliver on her promise.

Especially with the current Ten Greats League season's unprecedented popularity, failure to do so would damage her personal brand and even tarnish the reputation of Heavenly Demon University.

"Kuang Tianqing has already set her sights on Zhang Yu."

"If Zhang Yu goes out to fight, he'll likely face a sneak attack from Kuang Tianqing."

"Then keeping Zhang Yu here to 'play in the mud' is the best arrangement."

"With pre-emptive layers of protection, I can rush back the moment Kuang Tianqing invades, giving me the home-field advantage in our confrontation."

"This is the ideal battlefield for my showdown with Kuang Tianqing."

"Luring her here significantly increases my chances of victory."

At that moment, Zhang Yu became the perfect bait to lure Kuang Tianqing into Dao Qiankun's trap.

Following this realization, Dao Qiankun, Zhang Yu, and Bai Zhenzhen contacted Wen Wuya, and after negotiations, they finalized a cooperation agreement.

During this process, Bai Zhenzhen turned to Dao Qiankun and asked, "Can I come fight with you?"

Bai Zhenzhen wanted to refine her sword technique in actual combat, striving to reach Kuang Tianqing's level. Her Divine Spiritual Root was perfectly suited for rapid progress through battle.

However, Bai Zhenzhen understood she was also being targeted by Kuang Tianqing. A reckless charge would leave her vulnerable to ambush.

Therefore, joining Dao Qiankun in battle seemed like the best option.

"Dao Qiankun is currently one of the strongest cultivators on this battlefield. Being by his side... might be the ideal combat environment for me right now."

For Dao Qiankun, who had already planned to cooperate with Heavenly Sword, this posed no problem.

After finalizing the alliance with Heavenly Sword, Dao Qiankun used his communication network to separately summon Cang Shenyu, the top student from Vajra University, and Tian Shengong, the top student from Immortal Armaments University, to discuss a four-university alliance.

Observing Dao Qiankun's every move, Zhang Yu silently compared him to Kuang Tianqing.

For Zhang Yu, who aspired to win first place in the Ten Greats League, Dao Qiankun, aside from Kuang Tianqing, might also become a future rival.

"Compared to Kuang Tianqing's lone wolf approach and ruthless tactics..."

"Dao Qiankun gives me the impression that he prefers leveraging his personal strength to catalyze massive momentum, achieving his goals through overwhelming force."

Before the meeting concluded, Zhang Yu's gaze swept over Dao Qiankun's retreating figure, and another thought suddenly struck him.

"A powerhouse like Dao Qiankun must possess a Dao Seed, right?"

However, Zhang Yu dismissed the idea almost immediately. Having only just begun interacting with Dao Qiankun, the topic of Dao Seeds seemed premature.

Next, Zhang Yu sought out Yan Qianji and began taking over the stronghold construction work.

Yan Qianji fully cooperated, as he had never been particularly interested in such tedious labor. Moreover, he believed these tasks would hardly earn him any recognition in the Team Tournament.

Compared to toiling behind the scenes with such thankless work, Yan Qianji preferred dominating opponents on the battlefield and seizing prisoners. This allowed him to showcase his presence, gain more attention and fame, and ultimately enhance his Immortal Dao Potential.

After taking over Yan Qianji's duties, Zhang Yu discovered that the foundations had already been well-laid, and considerable mining had been conducted in the surrounding veins, yielding ample building materials.

However, in Zhang Yu's view, the scale of construction remained too modest.

"We need to channel Spirit Veins to construct denser and larger-scale defensive fortifications, and deploy more powerful great formations."

"And to achieve all that, the first step is... materials."

As Zhang Yu pondered this, a blazing streak shot into the sky. Under his control, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God soared toward the ore veins, beginning to refine the ores and metals.

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu's Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power surged to life, telekinetically seizing vast quantities of construction materials from the surrounding area.

In his mind's eye, Zhang Yu recalled the temporary puppet he had designed during the Design Competition trials, combining the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology with Qi Resonance Spirituality.

"This puppet only needs a mother machine. It can continuously devour materials, self-reproduce, and gather even more resources."

"Perfect for use in this team tournament to scavenge materials from the floating continent."

While one strand of his consciousness refined the temporary puppet mother machine, another activated Earthly Fiend Gravity, probing deep beneath the earth.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "I remember the floating continent having a complete environment and even artificial Spirit Veins prepared..."

In the next moment, his eyes lit up, and he suddenly shouted, "Spirit Veins! Come to me!"

With a thunderous roar like an earthquake, the entire ground beneath Zhang Yu's feet began to tremble violently.

For the next period, Zhang Yu threw himself wholeheartedly into constructing the prison.

He leveled mountain peaks, channeled Spirit Veins into place, erected defensive towers that sprouted from the ground, and unleashed vast hordes of puppets in diverse forms to spread across the mountains and plains.

While Zhang Yu was fully engaged in construction and production, the four great academies — Myriad Laws, Heavenly Sword, Vajra, and Immortal Soldiers — gradually forged a cooperative alliance.

Under Dao Qiankun's leadership, the other three academies agreed to transfer all their prisoners to the prison, where they would be jointly guarded by all four institutions.

At least one top-ranked student from each academy would be stationed at the prison at all times.
