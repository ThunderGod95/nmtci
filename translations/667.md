# Chapter 667: Inverted Kunlun, Vocational College Golden Core

Ever since activating the Chain Formation Diagram within the Feather Book, Zhang Yu had felt its assistance growing steadily. Especially after each breakthrough in his cultivation realm, the Chain Formation Diagram would generate new sets of diagrams tailored to the cultivation arts of his current realm.

For instance, progressing from the High School Sacred Body in the Qi Refining Realm to the University Holy Body in the Foundation Establishment Realm had continuously benefited Zhang Yu within their respective realms.

How to put it? This might just be the confidence of a true genius.

Some Chain Formation Diagram Set effects, in Zhang Yu's view, transcended the limitations of cultivation realms. The Artifact Refinement Prodigy's boost to learning and production efficiency was one such example.

Zhang Yu felt the same about Inverted Kunlun. For instance, the First Layer effect, which doubled the destructive and transformative power of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering on the environment, lacked any explicit restriction tied to a specific realm's peak.

When the eighth martial art required for Inverted Kunlun reached Level 20, the Second Layer effect materialized, further confirming Zhang Yu's assessment.

Advanced - Inverted Kunlun (8/8): Gravity fluctuations induced by the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering can now be sustained for extended periods, with the duration increasing proportionally to the Magic Power invested.

Seeing the Second Layer's effect, Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened slightly. "Maintain for an extended period?" he mused.

He clenched his five fingers, and as the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power surged, strands of Earthly Fiend Gravity coalesced within his palm, forming a Gravity Cluster that hovered in the air, emitting a constant gravitational pull.

In subsequent experiments, Zhang Yu discovered that even after ceasing the flow of Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, the Gravity Cluster remained active.

He even left the Flying Boat, flew far away, and removed the Gravity Cluster from his control range... yet upon returning, it was still functioning.

"It's almost like it's become a natural phenomenon," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "However, it still has a time limit. It dissipates after about half an hour."

"But if I channel more Magic Power into it, I can extend its duration."

"This Second Layer's effect... combined with the First Layer's amplified environmental alteration and destruction, offers immense utility for both work and combat."

"For labor, a single application could achieve results that would normally take days or even weeks, greatly increasing efficiency."

"In combat, if I have enough time to prepare the battlefield, I can create an environment that gives me an overwhelming advantage. Alternatively, I could unleash a devastatingly powerful killing move."

As Zhang Yu's eyes flashed with inspiration, countless ideas flooded his mind, further fueling his anticipation for the third layer's effects of Inverted Kunlun.

"Ah, if Kunxu had tailored its education to individual talents, I wouldn't still be outside a sect."

"The current education system is flawed. It only values exams, grades, and certificates, stifling my potential."

Zhang Yu continued practicing the Kunlun in the Palm Immortal Sect Technique, cycling through its three moves. While progress slowed after Level 20, his advancement still far outpaced that of cultivators at the same realm, progressing at rocket-like speed. In the blink of an eye, he reached Level 21, pushing the technique into the Golden Core Realm.

Instantly, a flood of profound insights into Kunlun in the Palm surged into Zhang Yu's mind.

Each upgrade to Kunlun in the Palm amplified the technique's power, enhancing his ability to absorb, magnify, and shrink objects to ever greater extremes.

Now that the technique had reached the Golden Core Realm, he sensed that by channeling his full power, he could even contain the entire Flying Boat within his palm.

Zhang Yu unleashed a palm strike, instantly drawing a nearby table toward him with a *whoosh*. The table rapidly shrank to the size of a thumb before landing in his palm.

Activating his Immortal Descendant ability, he deposited the thumb-sized table into the spatial realm he had created.

The Immortal Descendant ability allowed him to create a 10-cubic-meter spatial realm. Because this realm was linked to the authority of the Immortals, Zhang Yu named it Immortal Space.

Originally, the entrance to Immortal Space, though accessible through Zhang Yu's body, was limited to a mere 30 square centimeters — roughly the size of a fist — making it impractical for storing anything substantial.

However, as Zhang Yu's Kunlun in the Palm cultivation art advanced, granting him the ability to manipulate the size of objects, this 30-square-centimeter restriction was shattered.

Observing that the table within Immortal Space remained thumb-sized, Zhang Yu nodded in satisfaction. "Excellent. Even within Immortal Space, Kunlun in the Palm continues to function."

"This effectively expands the entrance and capacity of Immortal Space by hundreds, perhaps thousands, of times."

Zhang Yu sensed that the Immortal Descendant ability only reached its true potential when paired with an Immortal Sect Technique like Kunlun in the Palm.

Of course, Zhang Yu could sense that maintaining Kunlun in the Palm required constant operation, continuously draining his Magic Power.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "With my current Magic Power, I can't shrink and store large quantities of materials in the Immortal Space for extended periods."

With a thought, he deactivated Kunlun in the Palm. The table in the Immortal Space instantly reverted to its original size, occupying a considerable volume.

Zhang Yu mused, "For now, shrinking items for storage in the Immortal Space is only a temporary solution. For long-term storage, it's best to use items that don't need to be shrunk."

"The most practical uses for the Immortal Space are still smuggling and theft."

"Secondly, it enhances my combat capabilities..."

As Zhang Yu's thoughts shifted, twenty-four Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords shot toward him from all directions.

With a swift palm strike, the flying swords, now mixed with the surrounding air, darted into his palm like twenty-four swimming fish before being swallowed whole by the Immortal Space.

"With Kunlun in the Palm combined with Immortal Space, my defensive capabilities have reached another peak. As long as my Magic Power holds out, I can withstand any form of attack."

"However, the Immortal Space is too conspicuous to use openly in public."

Zhang Yu knew that with the world in chaos and the Righteous Gods vanished, opportunities to use the Immortal Space would inevitably arise.

Suddenly, his gaze shifted. Activating the Inverted Kunlun set effect, he cast a Gravity Cluster and immediately stored it within the Immortal Space.

Watching the Gravity Cluster continue to operate and accumulate power within the Immortal Space, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "With this, I can charge up in advance using the Immortal Space. If I could charge it for a few days, how many at my cultivation level could withstand a single strike?"

In an instant, Zhang Yu's mind flooded with countless brilliant ideas. He realized there were still many ingenious ways to combine the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, Inverted Kunlun, Kunlun in the Palm, and Immortal Space.

As he pondered, his mind involuntarily drifted back to his battle with Dao Qiankun.

Now that Zhang Yu had advanced Kunlun in the Palm to Level 21, he felt Dao Qiankun's strength in that battle even more keenly.

"Though we both used spatial technology, Brother Dao's martial arts were far more comprehensive and fluid than mine. His mastery was boundless and effortless compared to my current clumsy attempts."

"According to my sister, Brother Dao isn't a true Immortal, but merely possesses an Immortal's memories."

"Yet even with just those memories, he managed to withstand Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators for a time while still in the Foundation Establishment Realm. After breaking through to Golden Core, he nearly captured me."

"I wonder if Brother Dao will truly return in three years?"

Shaking his head, Zhang Yu refocused entirely on his cultivation. Within an hour, he had advanced Kunlun in the Palm to the 24th tier.

Just then, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's Incarnation finally arrived.

With this support, the Heavenly Sword and Myriad Laws Flying Boat fleets abandoned their hiding places and converged on the school, leaving long trails of turbulent air in the wake of the Blood Moon.

Zhang Yu ignored the commotion, continuing to immerse himself in cultivation. He pushed Kunlun in the Palm to the 25th tier, then the 26th... all the way to the 30th tier!

Shortly after reaching the 30th tier, Zhang Yu was summoned by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Arriving at the scene, he discovered that Wen Wuya and Bai Zhenzhen had also broken through to the Golden Core Realm.

Upon asking, Zhang Yu learned that a newly advanced Soul Transformation cultivator from Heavenly Sword University had sent out news of their breakthrough, along with Golden Core Certificates for Wen Wuya and Bai Zhenzhen, allowing them to use the arena resources they had gathered to achieve their breakthroughs.

Looking at the two groups of students from Myriad Laws and Heavenly Sword Universities, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "On our way back, we'll be passing by a factory invested in by Myriad Laws University. This fully automated, unmanned factory was originally maintained by Righteous Gods and Soul Cultivators, producing a significant amount of resources needed for Golden Core cultivation."

"But now that the Righteous Gods have vanished and the Soul Cultivators have lost contact, the factory has ceased operations."

"I've received recent intelligence that a group of wild Golden Core cultivators has seized the factory, broken into the warehouse, and are currently looting the Immortal Dao resources stored there."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed. "Without the Righteous Gods, some people have become like wild beasts freed from their chains. Especially since the Moon was captured by the Evil God, some have been emboldened to commit arson, murder, and looting everywhere."

"Now, not only are our university's factories and warehouses under attack across the country, but logistics teams are also operating with decreasing efficiency, requiring armed escorts for every journey."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole could sense that as chaos spread across the land, the efficiency of society as a whole was steadily declining.

Shaking her head, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's gaze swept over the assembled students. "Now that you've all reached the Golden Core Realm, I plan to send a group of you to clear out this factory and reclaim the supplies. Who's willing to go?"

None of the students responded. Some were still at the Foundation Establishment Stage, while others had just broken through to the Golden Core Realm and were focused on consolidating their cultivation and advancing further. None were eager to fight other Golden Core Realm opponents.

With the Righteous God's connection severed, death meant true annihilation, preventing reincarnation as a Soul Cultivator in the Spirit Realm. To many, death was now truly final.

This infinitely increased the cost of dying, making the Heavenly Chosen before her even more reluctant to take risks.

Fighting and killing? What could be more reassuring than cultivating peacefully back in University City?

Feeling Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's piercing gaze, Ye Xingli forced herself to ask, "How many opponents are there?"

"About twenty to thirty Golden Core cultivators," the Divine Monarch replied calmly.

Ye Xingli immediately took a step back. "Teacher, I'm just a streamer. I'm good at product promotion, publicity, and research, but combat is definitely not my forte."

Noticing the Divine Monarch's gaze shifting toward him, Yan Qianji quickly added, "I just broke through to the Golden Core Realm and need to consolidate my foundation."

Sensing Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's gaze, Wen Wuya said, "Now that the Righteous Gods are gone, those who die can no longer enter the Spirit Realm. I believe that to reliably deal with Golden Core True Persons, we need to deploy at least Nascent Soul-level forces."

Yu Xinghan replied, "I'm just a masseuse. What do I know about fighting? Isn't Zhang Yu the strongest undergraduate? Would he be willing to go?"

Zhang Yu waved his hand. "I just broke through to the Golden Core. I need at least two or three years to stabilize my foundation before I can go to war."

Zhang Yu, now a Dual Soul Transformation disciple and the strongest undergraduate with unfathomable potential yet to be realized, naturally didn't want to risk facing other Golden Core True Persons in battle.

He had resolved not to enter the battlefield until his cultivation reached its absolute peak. After all, he was no longer the desperate, penniless student who had to fight tooth and nail for every exam.

Just having broken through to the Golden Core, Zhang Yu was unwilling to risk combat, and the other students around him clearly shared his sentiment.

Observing their reluctance, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "According to the intelligence I've gathered, these wild Golden Cores were originally Foundation Establishment Stage teachers from Vocational Colleges, all over a hundred years old with their potential exhausted. It seems they recently joined the Demonic Sect and broke through to the Golden Core not long ago. They're all Old Vocational College Golden Cores."

The moment the words "Old Vocational College Golden Core" were spoken, the eyes of everyone present lit up.

She continued, "This factory is used to produce Dao Foundation Potions. After we seize it, half of the remaining supplies will be distributed among those who participate in the operation."

Bai Zhenzhen, who had recently and successfully broken through to the Golden Core Realm, abruptly stood up and declared, "These Old Vocational College Golden Cores are utterly undisciplined. It's time someone taught them a lesson. I'm willing to go."

Zhang Yu chimed in, "Such valuable Immortal Dao resources are being squandered by these Vocational College Golden Cores! I can't stand by and watch the university's assets be wasted like this!"

Ye Xingli added, "Though I'm just a streamer, protecting the university's assets is my duty."

Wen Wuya stated, "While this is primarily Myriad Laws University's affair, Heavenly Sword and Myriad Laws have been allies for generations. I'm definitely helping."

Seeing the group's eagerness upon hearing about the Vocational College Golden Cores, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded in approval. "Excellent. You're not taking unnecessary risks, but you're also not missing opportunities. You don't underestimate your opponents, but you also don't overestimate them. You're all doing well."

"I hope you'll remember this caution and courage in the chaotic times ahead."

"Remember, in the Immortal Dao War, the chances of the weak defeating the strong are virtually zero."

"Almost all victories are built upon the strong crushing the weak, and the outcome is decided long before the battle even begins."

"So-called combat experience is nothing more than the experience of suppressing the weak, humiliating the weak, and killing the weak."

Countless memories seemed to flash through Magnetic Pole's eyes as she sighed deeply. "To survive and thrive in this chaotic world, you must cultivate faster and constantly strengthen yourselves."

"Equally important is learning how to defeat the weak more quickly and efficiently, plunder their resources, and absorb them as nourishment for your own growth."

Director Gao chimed in, "This mission is an excellent opportunity for you to gain such experience."

"Remember, this is unlike your usual training battles. There are no rules, no spectators, no need to worry about reputation or prestige. Death here is final..."

"No Righteous Gods, no laws — don't worry about compensation for injuries or medical expenses..."

The two instructors, both seasoned veterans of such conflicts, imparted their hard-earned wisdom to the students through their conversation.

Soon after, the Flying Boat hovered above the factory.

Though the participating students mentally looked down on the Vocational College Golden Cores, they acted with extreme caution.

Bai Zhenzhen activated her Divine Spiritual Root, releasing an invisible flying sword to scout the factory below. She then sent back the recorded footage.

Bai Zhenzhen: "There are 22 Vocational College Golden Cores, all gathered inside and outside the warehouse. Fucking hell... they're still squandering the supplies."

Wen Wuya: "What about the other direction? Are those people working?"

Bai Zhenzhen: "They seem to be Junior College Students captured by the Vocational College Golden Cores, forced to move supplies and do menial tasks."

Watching the footage Bai Zhenzhen sent back, Yan Qianji exclaimed, "Some of them are even sleeping?"

Bai Zhenzhen: "The Vocational College Golden Cores apparently refuse to provide sleep-suppressing drugs. They're making the captured Junior College Students work in shifts — one group sleeps while the other works."

Yan Qianji sighed. "Without legal constraints, these bastards have become so ruthless? Isn't this just halving people's lifespans?"

Director Gao remarked calmly, "It's not just their lifespans that are halved. They likely receive no wages either. Without the order established by the Righteous God, such slave systems will become increasingly common."

The Junior College Students were even more shocked to hear about the lack of wages.

Sleeping all day without pay? In their eyes, the Vocational College encampment had transformed into a veritable hellhole.

Within moments, the situation inside and outside the factory was thoroughly assessed, and the group began assigning tasks.

Meanwhile, inside and outside the factory's warehouses, Vocational College Golden Cores were recklessly squandering resources.

Hou Feifeng frantically injected himself with potion after potion, reveling in the exhilarating surge of his cultivation. He felt his withered, aged muscles gradually regain their luster, and as his vital energy surged, the physical expression factor — or what some called the Dao Foundation — began to surface.

"So this is what the wealthy use regularly?"

"Damn it... if we could cultivate like them, how could we possibly be inferior?"

On the other side, another white-haired Vocational College Golden Core cultivator spoke with bitter resentment: "We are the generation sacrificed by Kunxu's Immortal Dao education system. Those Ten Greats graduates only surpassed us because they had access to far greater resources."

"But now, our chance to defy fate has finally arrived. We've broken through to the Golden Core Realm, making us stronger than even the students in the Ten Greats League. If we seize enough resources, our futures won't necessarily be inferior to theirs."

He roared inwardly: "Teachers and students of the Ten Greats... just watch! I'll make you regret your arrogance and show you that exams and certificates can never truly measure a person's potential! This isn't how the Immortal Dao is meant to be cultivated!"

An aged Vocational College Golden Core cultivator, lacking such fiery ambition, simply murmured, "At least living a little longer is better than dying now."

Just then, a whistling sound tore through the sky. Several Vocational College Golden Core cultivators erupted in sprays of blood, their bodies instantly shredded into bloody pulp by sword qi.

First came the combined flying sword assassination by Bai Zhenzhen and Wen Wuya, followed by Ye Xingli coordinating Yan Qianji's puppet army to close in.

Hou Feifeng, witnessing the massive commotion, was startled. "Could the main force of Myriad Laws University have arrived?"

The numerous Vocational College Golden Cores, each carrying their own supplies, immediately scattered in panic.

But soon, the ground began to tremble, and a formation's power descended from the sky, suppressing their Magic Power and hindering their ability to gather spiritual energy.

Hou Feifeng's expression turned bitter. "Are you kidding me? First a sword formation, then a puppet army, and now a formation covering the entire factory? All just to deal with us?"

The Vocational College Golden Cores quickly became lost within the formation, one by one suppressed from afar by flying swords and puppets. Even now, they still couldn't identify their attackers.

Hou Feifeng, however, continued to flee, breaking through layer after layer of defenses until he felt he was about to escape the factory gates.

"With such an assault," he thought grimly, "at least a senior Golden Core from Myriad Laws University must have arrived!"

At that moment, his sole focus was escape, daring not even glance back.

Suddenly, Hou Feifeng's gaze sharpened as he spotted a figure emerging on the road ahead.

"Zhang Yu?!"

The figure was unmistakably familiar. Recent relentless publicity and advertisements had made it impossible for him not to recognize the champion of the Ten Greats League.

Despite his initial surprise, Hou Feifeng acted without hesitation.

"So what if he's a champion?"

"He's probably only recently broken through to the Golden Core Realm. We're on equal footing!"

With a furious roar, Hou Feifeng unleashed his full-power strike at Zhang Yu.

A massive surge of qi erupted, shattering the ground for hundreds of meters around and sending plumes of dust and debris soaring into the sky.

Amidst the violent collision, Hou Feifeng felt a metallic taste in his throat and spat out a mouthful of blood. His Hand Bionic shattered, its mechanisms failing.

"Impressive... no wonder he's ranked first among the Ten Greats," Hou Feifeng thought, his heart pounding with excitement. "But he's not as formidable as I imagined. He can't stop me!"

Yet in the very next moment, he sensed a figure materialize behind him and felt a palm strike his back with devastating force.

With a single strike, a frigid tide surged into Hou Feifeng's body.

He felt utterly helpless, like an impotent husband forced to watch as the icy torrent relentlessly flooded his Dantian. The Dantian, which had moments ago been churning like a volcanic eruption, instantly froze solid, plunging into stillness.

Hou Feifeng crashed to the ground with a thud, staring in shock at Zhang Yu, who had just ambushed him. His heart burned with resentment.

Zhang Yu, however, glanced at him strangely, then turned to examine the Gang Qi avatar he had created.

"A mere Gang Qi avatar? Is it really that hard to defeat?"

With a sharp crack, the avatar shattered. Zhang Yu glanced again at Hou Feifeng, who was spitting blood. "I thought he was deliberately acting weak to lure me into an ambush... So he really can't win?"

As this thought flashed through Zhang Yu's mind, the "Zhang Yu" who had ambushed Hou Feifeng dissolved into a wisp of Gang Qi and vanished.

Clearly, both the figure who had intercepted Hou Feifeng and the one who had ambushed him were Gang Qi avatars created by Zhang Yu.

Watching the two Gang Qi avatars dissipate, Hou Feifeng's face was filled with astonishment. "Just two instances of Gang Qi? How could there be such a difference? How could..."

Zhang Yu's voice drifted from afar. "You didn't... cultivate your own Golden Core, did you? That's the Extreme Tiger Golden Core, isn't it?"

Hou Feifeng flinched as if struck a nerve. He had always felt ashamed about not being able to afford a pre-made Golden Core and having to cultivate his own to break through.

His face flushed crimson as he retorted, "How else was I supposed to reach the Golden Core Realm if not by cultivating my own?"

Zhang Yu shook his head. "Of course, you should have bought a pre-made Golden Core first, then cultivated it. How could your self-made core possibly compare to products refined through countless experiments by corporations and universities?"

Zhang Yu sighed. "Hand-crafted cores are prone to errors. Many Bionics and magical artifacts won't be compatible with them."

Hou Feifeng snapped, "You Top Ten Students, living in your ivory towers, have no idea how hard it is for us! How am I supposed to earn Spirit Coins to buy a Golden Core if I can't even reach the Golden Core Realm?"
