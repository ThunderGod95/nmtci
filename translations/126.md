# Chapter 126: Yu-boy, You Smell So Good

Two hours later, Le Mulan left the training room limping, her legs and hands covered in bruises, yet a flicker of excitement crossed her face.

"My adaptability is very fast. At this rate, it won't be long before I can completely overcome my psychological aversion to the poor."

"This way, my performance won't be affected even when I switch heart arts in the future..."

Meanwhile, inside the training room, Zhang Yu lay on the floor, panting heavily, looking as if he had just been pulled from the water.

His entire body and the floor around him were saturated with a medicinal fragrance.

"That woman… just how many alchemical enhancers does she take every day? Does she eat them for every meal?"

But after a short rest, Zhang Yu felt invigorated and full of energy.

Despite having fought fiercely with Le Mulan for two hours, he now felt that not only had his stamina not been depleted, but his energy was also incredibly abundant, and even the circulation of mana within his body seemed much more vigorous.

_Is this the effect of Le Mulan's medicinal residue?_

Zhang Yu could swear to the heavens that during the entire grueling fight with Le Mulan, he had absolutely not opened his mouth to lick up a single drop of the potion.

_Forget licking, I was holding my breath half the time. How could I still be affected by it?_

After all, the original Zhang Yu's internal organs had been damaged by drugs, so the current Zhang Yu was always very careful with dosages, never using them recklessly unless absolutely necessary.

This was to avoid the side effects from damaging his body.

Feeling his current state, Zhang Yu thought to himself, _Could it work through skin contact too?_

_And why does it feel so much more effective than the potions I normally use?_

_It doesn't seem to have that straining feeling on my body either…_

Just as Zhang Yu was slowly walking out of the training room, Fu Ji suddenly spoke up. "Leaving already?"

Zhang Yu paused. "Is there a problem?"

Fu Ji said, "Aren't you going to collect the potion?"

Zhang Yu asked, "What potion?"

Fu Ji replied, "Isn't it all over the floor?"

Zhang Yu glanced at the puddle on the floor, which was still steaming, and his face darkened. "Who would want to collect that!"

Fu Ji said, "Just as she said, that Le Mulan really does use the highest-grade stuff. For a rich person like her, even her sweat is more valuable than the enhancers you people use."

"Although it's now mixed with a lot of your sweat, lowering the purity quite a bit."

"But if you sold it as a supplement, you could probably make a few thousand..."

Zhang Yu turned and walked away. "Who knows what ingredients are in her enhancers, what effects they have, or what side effects they might cause. Besides, I don't have a license to sell them. What if I get caught?"

Fu Ji thought to herself what a pity it was, suppressing the suggestion that even if he didn't sell it, he could take it home for himself and Bai Zhenzhen to drink.

_This Zhang Yu’s pauper pride is still too strong,_ Fu Ji mused. _He's already at the bottom of the ladder. To save money, to make money, what's there to be shy about? Using every single resource to climb higher is the proper way to survive in Kunxu._

Zhang Yu looked at his shredded pants, thinking it wouldn't be right to walk all the way back like this.

After a moment's thought, he sent a message to Le Mulan: "You broke my pants."

A transfer of 200 arrived.

200 transfer received.

Zhang Yu replied, "I meant, could you send a pair of pants over."

About ten minutes later, Lian Tianji appeared before Zhang Yu, holding a pair of pants.

Lian Tianji asked with curiosity, "Were you having a sparring session with the hallowed number one?"

Zhang Yu nodded. "Yeah… my pants got ruined by accident."

With that, he took the pants from Lian Tianji and thanked him.

Looking at Zhang Yu's tattered clothes, Lian Tianji could almost imagine the intensity of the battle.

_Sigh, I wish I could have a sparring session with the hallowed number one too, instead of just delivering pants after the fight is over,_ he thought to himself.

_Unfortunately, I'm not strong enough. The closest I ever get to her is when I'm being her stool._

Lian Tianji watched Zhang Yu's retreating figure, thinking, _Only by becoming an academic prodigy like Zhang Yu can one engage in close combat with the hallowed number one, can one stand close to her, instead of having to be on all fours to approach the hallowed number one…_

On the other side, as Zhang Yu walked out of the training room, he sensed the condition of his body and thought, _Is the medicinal effect still working? I'll observe for another day._

_If there are no side effects, maybe it's because the quality of the enhancers Le Mulan uses is exceptionally good, so the side effects are minimal?_

_Or is it because my body is getting stronger, my internal organs are gradually strengthening, and I've purged the toxins accumulated in the past…_

_Or perhaps it's a combination of both?_

After some consideration, Zhang Yu decided to continue sparring with Le Mulan.

After all, at 12,000 an hour, two hours meant 24,000. For a job that paid 24,000 per session, he could tolerate being forced to take some drugs, as long as the consequences weren't severe.

Upon returning to the bridge underpass, he found that Bai Zhenzhen hadn't returned from the hospital yet. Zhang Yu thought for a moment and decided to buy and start cultivating a new technique.

After all, the 300,000 prize money had already been deposited, and Zhang Yu had been itching to spend it. He immediately spent 120,000 to purchase the usage rights for the Great Sun Sea of Qi.

With this transaction, and adding in the sparring fee from Le Mulan today, Zhang Yu's savings were now just over 210,000.

After scanning the contents of the electronic manual, Zhang Yu concluded that, as its description promised, the Great Sun Sea of Qi was not a particularly difficult technique.

"The key to this technique lies in the accumulation of practice. In that case…"

Feathered Tome: Zhang Yu! Show me your limits!

With the Feathered Tome's mastery activated, Zhang Yu began cultivating the Great Sun Sea of Qi.

Although it was an expert-level, mid-stage Qi Refinement technique, Zhang Yu's current stats were not low—in fact, they were higher than many second-year students at Songyang High School, perfectly meeting the requirements for practicing the Great Sun Sea of Qi.

He halted the flow of the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method, which had previously circulated as ceaselessly as a mighty river.

The mana circuit that had coursed through his entire body was interrupted, and all his mana was recalled to his dantian.

Then, a stream of mana rose from his dantian and was gradually condensed by Zhang Yu into Great Sun Mana, which shone with a fine golden light.

This stream of Great Sun Mana then began to travel through the meridians in his body, starting to construct a new mana circuit.

Condensing Great Sun Mana and constructing the mana circuit simultaneously.

Yet Zhang Yu felt no difficulty at all; with the level of mana control he had gained from mastering numerous level-10 techniques, practicing the Great Sun Sea of Qi was a piece of cake.

What surprised him even more… was that under the stimulation of the lingering medicinal power, his mana circulated a third faster than usual.

And as his cultivation continued, Zhang Yu felt his mind become exceptionally sharp… it seemed he could even save on the neural filler that eliminated the need for sleep.

_Is this the effect of Le Mulan's potion?_

_Not only does it replenish stamina and stimulate mana, but it can also enhance mental acuity and eliminate sleep?_

Zhang Yu recalled what Fu Ji had said earlier.

_That Le Mulan woman… could the sweat from her body really be more effective and more valuable than the potions I bought on the day of the competition?_

_Damn it, these rich people are truly detestable._

For a moment, Zhang Yu felt a sudden kinship with the mortals who snuck into the sewers of White Dragon High School to steal gutter water.

Because just now, an impulse had flashed through his mind: the next time he went to Purple Cloud High School, maybe he should collect some of Le Mulan's sweat to use.

_Stop, Zhang Yu!_

_Don't be corrupted by Kunxu!_

_You are not that kind of person!_

Zhang Yu quickly reined in his thoughts, refocusing his attention on the Great Sun Sea of Qi.

Nine minutes later, as the first cycle of the Great Sun Sea of Qi was complete, a wealth of insights flooded Zhang Yu's mind, all related to key points to heed while circulating the Great Sun Mana.

Beyond that, he felt his internal body temperature gradually rising, growing hotter and hotter.

In the darkness, pinpricks of light were gradually drawn toward Zhang Yu.

It was the moonlight from the sky, the distant neon lights, the lights of a thousand homes on the opposite bank… wisps of radiance were drawn to Zhang Yu, causing him to slowly emanate a faint glow.

Fu Ji observed this scene and thought, _As I thought… it's a success?_

_Mastering the first level of the Great Sun Sea of Qi normally requires a month of light exposure for the cultivator to gradually adapt to the Great Sun Mana… but he completed this step in a matter of moments._

_This boy’s potential is just as I’d observed and judged. As long as he practices, he improves at a rapid pace, even bypassing some of the technique's inherent limitations._

As Fu Ji was thinking this, Zhang Yu continued to cultivate the Great Sun Sea of Qi, pushing the Great Sun Mana throughout his body, constantly attracting the light from the night sky and making himself brighter and brighter.

By the time Bai Zhenzhen returned to the bridge underpass, Zhang Yu had already advanced the Great Sun Sea of Qi to Level 1 (4/10).

At this moment, Zhang Yu's entire body was emanating faint wisps of light from within. When he opened his eyes or mouth, Bai Zhenzhen could even see light shining out from them.

Bai Zhenzhen said in surprise, "Is this that Great Sun Sea of Qi you were talking about? You're making quite a scene, glowing like that. It's too conspicuous."

Zhang Yu, feeling the faint light radiating from his body, nodded slightly. "It is a bit conspicuous, but I'm about to rent an apartment anyway. I can just practice in my room then."

"In that case, can we rely on this trick of yours to save on the electricity bill for lights?"

Zhang Yu shook his head and explained, "I'm afraid not. The essence of the Great Sun Sea of Qi is to absorb light and refine mana, not to release light."

"If I practice in a room, not only will I not save electricity, I'll probably need a high-power light bulb shining on me to improve the efficiency of mana refinement."

Bai Zhenzhen lamented, "So this technique is a major power hog."

Zhang Yu continued, "But it's only like this in the early stages. As the level of the Great Sun Sea of Qi increases, the effect of absorbing light will become stronger and stronger. Eventually, no light will shine through my body; instead, I'll become darker when I circulate my energy."

"By then, I can just go outside at night and absorb the light from the skyscrapers."

Listening to Zhang Yu's description of the Great Sun Sea of Qi, Bai Zhenzhen clicked her tongue in wonder. But as she drew closer to him, a peculiar fragrance wafted over, and she asked in surprise, "Yu-boy, what’s that smell on you? Why do you smell so good?"
