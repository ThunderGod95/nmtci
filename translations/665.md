# Chapter 665: Golden Core Certificate, University War

As Dao Qiankun's figure soared into the sky and vanished from sight, Zhang Yu finally relaxed slightly, his gaze falling upon the magical artifacts left on the ground.

The Heavenly Sun Radiance God, the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, and the twenty-four Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords remained behind, not having departed with their master.

Watching this scene, Zhang Yu murmured to himself, "Dao... Brother, did you leave these deliberately?"

He had no time to dwell on it. Sensing the ongoing fierce battle outside, Zhang Yu swiftly reconnected with the magical artifacts and flying swords, then donned the armor once more.

Simultaneously, Director Gao, True Person Starfire, Zhang Pianpian, Yu Xinghan, and Le Mulan gathered around Zhang Yu.

In the next moment, the sudden disappearance of the sixth-layer phenomenon drew everyone's attention.

Reading the message from the Heavenly Court, Zhang Yu's heart jolted with shock. "No communication with the Heavenly Court or sects for the next two years?"

Ever since he had begun cultivating, Zhang Yu had felt his every action constantly monitored and constrained by the Heavenly Court and sect regulations, under the watchful eyes of countless Righteous Gods. He had always felt a stifling lack of freedom.

But now, as all those restraints shattered in an instant, a sense of bewilderment washed over Zhang Yu.

Director Gao barked, "This place isn't safe. We need to move now!"

The group followed Director Gao as they tried to break through the crowd, only to find a massive number of uncertified powerhouses converging on the scene, locked in fierce combat with the elites from the Ten Great Universities.

Thunderlight and qi blasts collided and exploded repeatedly, unleashing hurricane-force winds that turned the award ceremony venue into utter chaos.

True Monarch Tranquility arrived with Yan Qianji, Ye Xingli, and others, joining Director Gao, Zhang Yu, and their group as they continued their desperate escape.

Though individually weaker than the Ten Universities' elites, the uncertified powerhouses vastly outnumbered them and fought with suicidal ferocity, charging relentlessly in wave after wave and pinning the group in place.

Yu Xinghan, sheltered behind Director Gao, exclaimed in shock, "Where did all these uncertified powerhouses come from?"

Zhang Pianpian replied grimly, "Some are disguised by Dao Qiankun using his Immortal authority. Others likely completed their breakthroughs just before or after the Righteous Gods vanished. They're all believers of the Ascension Sect, utterly fearless of death. We need to watch out for their kamikaze tactics."

Zhang Yu glanced at Yu Xinghan. During his earlier clash with Dao Qiankun, he had sensed spatial fluctuations that didn't originate from either himself or Brother Dao.

Apart from Zhang Yu and Dao Qiankun, few others present seemed to notice the faint spatial fluctuations that weren't originating from them.

"Is it Yu Xinghan?" Zhang Yu wondered, recalling information about the Third Eye Mystic Power.

"Did he learn something from watching my fight with Brother Dao?"

However, Zhang Yu knew this wasn't the time for such thoughts. The fleeting ideas vanished as he refocused his full attention on the battle before him.

Just then, the moon in the sky began to glow with a faint crimson light, and the Evil God's laughter echoed in everyone's ears.

"What's happening?"

True Monarch Tranquility's gaze sharpened as he sensed his Bionic's parameters going haywire. The Bionic Eye's vision gradually filled with illusions, and all Soul Cultivator commands began to lag.

The powerhouses from the Ten Great Universities were similarly affected, either disconnecting from the Spirit Realm or shutting down their Bionics, instantly losing their advantage.

At that moment, the Spirit Realm surged violently. A phantom image of a treasure pagoda descended from the sky, sweeping across the battlefield with scorching light, instantly purging all traces of the Evil God's influence from the Spirit Realm Network.

Seeing the pagoda's shadow, Zhang Yu's heart leaped with joy. "The Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda? Master has arrived!"

Director Gao's gaze sharpened as he sensed an unusual aura emanating from the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda.

He recalled the message the Heavenly Court had sent to all Myriad Laws Masters and Students earlier that day, confirming that Magnetic Pole, the acting principal, had obtained her Soul Transformation Certificate.

Yet the speed of her breakthrough still astonished him, especially considering the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda before him...

"Level 41? She's already entered the Soul Transformation realm? And her magical artifact broke through so quickly too?"

Director Gao knew that the Soul Transformation realm had always been a formidable barrier. Even in the modern era, achieving it remained exceedingly difficult; simply possessing a Soul Transformation Certificate didn't guarantee success.

While he had long known that Magnetic Pole had been poised at the final threshold before Soul Transformation, on the verge of breaking through with the slightest nudge, the sheer speed and power of her breakthrough today still left him stunned... as if she had been meticulously prepared, merely awaiting this moment.

In the next instant, the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda erupted with renewed brilliance. Blazing Spirit Realm light swept across the battlefield, and wherever it passed, uncertified powerhouses screamed as their Bionics exploded, leaving them either dead or severely wounded.

After sweeping the entire battlefield, the figure of Magnetic Pole materialized atop the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda. She glanced at the assembled crowd and immediately sent out a series of messages.

Streams of spiritual light descended like radiant pillars, striking the heads of the recipients.

Seeing those Golden Core Certificates fall like snowflakes onto the heads of Zhang Yu, Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan, Zhang Pianpian, Ye Xingli, Yan Qianji, and the others, a trace of envy flashed across the faces of Tian Shengong, Wen Wuya, Ying Mingchi, and those standing nearby.

Even True Monarch Tranquility, a Nascent Soul expert, couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia at the sight.

It had been far too long since he'd witnessed such a mass issuance of Golden Core Certificates.

But then, an incomparably brilliant ray of light descended from Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's fingertip, slowly drifting toward Director Gao. The expressions of even the Nascent Soul experts from various universities, including True Monarch Tranquility, shifted dramatically, their faces now etched with envy and jealousy.

"A Soul Transformation Certificate..." Director Gao murmured as he accepted the radiant light, his gaze fixed on the lines of text that had haunted his dreams. "You're giving me this now, but I don't have the resources here to break through to Soul Transformation."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole replied: The resources you need to break through to Soul Transformation have already been prepared for you in University City.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: Bring Zhang Yu and the others back. I'll be waiting for you in University City.

At the same time, she sent a message to Zhang Yu: Your Golden Core Certificate will be issued today. I'll hold onto your Nascent Soul Certificate for now. I'll give it to you when you're ready to break through to the Nascent Soul stage.

After sending the same message to Ye Xingli, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole turned to the group and said quickly, "Time is limited. This projection of mine has crossed the Spirit Realm, but it can't linger for long. Otherwise, it will easily attract attention and draw more dangerous opponents to you."

"My true body is still engaged on another battlefield and can't be spared for now."

She glanced at the Blood Moon hanging in the sky before continuing, "However, one of my Incarnations is already on its way. Your immediate task is to hide yourselves and use the resources here to quickly complete your breakthroughs while awaiting my arrival."

"During this time, you must disconnect from the Spirit Realm Network as much as possible. Do not communicate with the outside world, and avoid contact with anyone else, including the Soul Cultivators among you."

Sensing the group's anxiety, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole reassured them, "Don't worry. After dawn tomorrow, you'll be able to restore your normal connections to the Spirit Realm."

At that moment, Tian Shengong spoke up from the side, "Divine Monarch, what should we do?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole scanned the students and faculty from the other Ten Great Universities — Immortal Soldiers, Vajra, Joyous Union, Netherworld, and others. With the Soul Transformation experts from each university gone, the massive changes sweeping through the heavens and earth, and the Spirit Realm now fraught with danger, they were all at a loss.

"Though the Soul Transformation experts from each university have lost contact," the Divine Monarch said calmly, "the Heavenly Court has already appointed new principals and issued new Divine Transformation Certificates. Your universities should already have candidates attempting to break through to Soul Transformation."

"However, among the Ten Great Universities, no one should be able to achieve a formal breakthrough faster than I did. They likely won't contact you until later."

"My advice remains the same: divide the resources within and outside the venue, find a safe place to hide, and await news from your universities."

"By tomorrow morning at the latest, the Spirit Realm Network will temporarily return to normal."

Sensing the faint wariness in the eyes of the teachers and students from the Heavenly Demon, Netherworld, Joyous Union, and White Bone schools, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "The true University War is about to begin."

"But it won't be between the Four Myriad Laws Schools and the Four Heavenly Demon Schools."

"Instead, it will be the Ten Greats against all Finance Departments, Demonic Sects, Evil Gods, and all cultivators harboring ulterior motives."

"Lower Colleges, Vocational Colleges, High Schools... countless arrogant fools will surge forth like a tidal wave. Those who believe the National College Entrance Examination failed to accurately assess their talents will be driven by their ambition and desires, foolishly attempting to challenge the Ten Greats with their crude Immortal Dao Technology."

"Your task for the next two years is to suppress them all."

The teachers and students, who had been tense moments before, now wore confident smiles after hearing Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's inspiring words. The atmosphere immediately relaxed as they realized the Ten Great Universities would unite to suppress students from Lower Colleges, Vocational Colleges, and High Schools.

After another urging, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's figure vanished before the crowd.

The remaining participants immediately began gathering the resources from the arena and surrounding areas.

To prepare for the Ten Greats League, Myriad Laws, Heavenly Demon, and other universities had provided their students with vast quantities of valuable cultivation resources. Even after the finals concluded, much remained unused.

However, since these supplies had been specifically prepared for the competition, they were primarily suited for the Foundation Establishment Realm, offering little benefit to Golden Core or Nascent Soul cultivators.

Moments later, the resources were divided among the participants. As the students watched the massive quantities of supplies being loaded onto their respective Flying Boats, a wave of excitement surged through them.

Ye Xingli, Yan Qianji, and others had already claimed their share of the resources and retreated to quiet chambers on their Flying Boats, preparing to break through to the Golden Core Realm.

Zhang Yu, however, did not attempt to advance to the Golden Core Realm. Instead, he hurried to the Heavenly Sword University's Flying Boat.

"Zhang Yu?" Wen Wuya's gaze flickered. "What is it? Do you want to return to Heavenly Sword University with me?"

Zhang Yu shook his head. "Where's A-Zhen? I want to take her with me."
