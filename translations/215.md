# Chapter 215: Bombing the Cemetery

Just as the gang elders in the conference room were endlessly debating who should be the new golden teacher, the argument came to a halt.

The bald elder suddenly said, "There's no need to argue. Just look at how Xiao Ma's class is going..."

It turned out that while they had been arguing, Zhang Yu, who was conducting his trial class, had directly asked every single elder in the class to give him one of the drugs they carried on them to demonstrate the power of his Spring and Autumn Endless Zen.

More than a dozen types of drugs, all with different brands and potencies—capsules, pills, injections—were all consumed by Zhang Yu in one go.

Under the effects of the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen and the High School Sacred Body, Zhang Yu quickly digested and absorbed the medicinal power, withstanding all the toxins and side effects.

And seeing Zhang Yu, who remained perfectly composed and showed no signs of abnormality after consuming so many drugs, the old men in the classroom grew even more impressed.

At the same time, the bald elder in the conference room said, "Xiao Ma has the gimmick and the skill. He can teach real material and provide emotional value. He is the undisputed choice for the golden teacher position this time."

Hearing the bald elder's words, some of the other elders who still wanted to support their own Teacher Yao or Teacher Bai were left speechless.

Everyone present was a veteran of the dark world of tutoring; they knew that in this market, a well-taught class did not necessarily mean a well-sold class.

But a teacher like Zhang Yu, who had such a powerful gimmick and whose Immortal Capital title could attract a large number of clients, coupled with his solid skills, was destined for explosive sales in the future.

"Then it's settled on Xiao Ma."

"We can do a promotional warm-up before the class starts."

"Isn't the Golden Class Gang competing with us for the elderly market? This is a perfect opportunity to push Xiao Ma's class against them. We'll definitely come out on top."

Meanwhile, Teacher Ci, Teacher Yao, and Teacher Bai were standing outside the trial classroom, listening to Zhang Yu's lecture with expressions of utter shock.

If the Immortal Capital identity had merely surprised and made them skeptical, then seeing Zhang Yu demonstrate the power of his Spring and Autumn Endless Zen had left all three of them truly astonished.

Teacher Yao thought to himself, _He actually consumed so many conflicting and incompatible drugs at once. His tolerance for drugs is terrifying. His metabolic capacity probably surpasses the three of us combined._

Teacher Ci and Teacher Bai exchanged a glance and shook their heads helplessly, knowing that with their opponent possessing both the Immortal Capital brand and such formidable skills, they had no hope of being chosen as the golden teacher this time.

After Zhang Yu's trial class ended, he walked out of the classroom under the reluctant gazes of the old men.

The other three teachers were no longer waiting outside; only Black Crow remained, looking at Zhang Yu with a smile. "Teacher Ma, the gang elders have decided that you will take over the position of golden teacher and lead this senior class from now on."

Black Crow then proceeded to discuss the specific salary and benefits with Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu did a rough calculation: five class hours a week would bring in about 250,000 in after-tax income, which amounted to around one million a month.

Black Crow said cautiously from the side, "It might be a little low at the beginning, since you're just starting to teach."

"But as long as your classes are effective, and with the gang's promotion, the number of class hours and students will surely continue to grow. At that point, an income of two million, or even three million a month, is entirely possible."

Fu Ji chuckled inwardly. _He's painting a pretty picture for you._

_But the cut they're giving you is indeed quite generous._

_It's probably because they heard your claim of being from the Immortal Capital and are afraid you'd find the offer too low._

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _The Immortal Capital identity is truly useful. Not only is it effective for fooling students, but it can also be used to command a higher price._

Although Zhang Yu had only been an Immortal Capital gentleman in an illusionary dream, as they say, once you dream of the Immortal Capital, you have feelings for it for life. He had already decided that from now on, his fake identity, Ma Yunteng, would be a genuine Immortal Capital gentleman.

Having successfully secured the position of golden teacher, Zhang Yu's thoughts turned to Bai Zhenzhen's gang operation the next day.

_I hope everything goes smoothly for Zhen tomorrow._

Time flew by, and the next day arrived.

Outside a cemetery in the remote suburbs of Songyang City, Bai Zhenzhen was standing with a group of people.

Before them stood a tall, dark-skinned man with the character for "study" tattooed on his face, his gaze cold as he looked at them.

The man spoke, "The Golden Class Gang has gone too far. Not only did they steal our curriculum and attack our golden teachers, they even colluded with the Immortal Resonance Group to get the campus sealed."

"So this time, in retaliation against the Golden Class Gang, we are going to do something big. We will join forces with the Deep Sea Group's security team to attack the Golden Class Gang's largest teaching location..."

According to the man's introduction, the Golden Class Gang's largest teaching spot was the cemetery right in front of them.

This place was a cemetery on the surface, but underground were the buried teachers of the Golden Class Gang. Students only needed to come and pay their respects with cash offerings to enter the underground tomb-palace for lessons. However, several reports had been filed to no avail, which led to this raid.

As Bai Zhenzhen listened to the man above boosting morale, she inwardly cursed, _Damn it... Am I being thrown into a major battle right from the start?_

Just then, the man on the platform continued, "In order to catch all the scum from the Golden Class Gang in one fell swoop, the gang will be using a copyright bomb this time."

"After the copyright bomb detonates, the Deep Sea Group's security team will move in and wipe out all the Golden Class Gang members inside..."

Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, _What in the world is a copyright bomb?_

The man took out a black cube and explained, "This is the copyright bomb meticulously created by the gang. Once activated, it will rapidly broadcast the Deep Sea Group's expert-level cultivation techniques at a sound intensity of 120 decibels, with an effective transmission distance of over a one-kilometer radius..."

_"The hell,"_ Bai Zhenzhen was shocked upon hearing this. _This is a terrorist attack!_

The man continued, "Because the underground structure of the cemetery is overly complex, elite masters from the gang will carry the copyright bomb and break in."

"We will now draw lots to select the members for the operation."

Bai Zhenzhen was speechless. _So the 'elite masters' are chosen by drawing lots from our group?_

A moment later, the man patted Bai Zhenzhen's shoulder and said, "Xiao Le, once you get inside and activate the copyright bomb, the company's security forces will immediately follow, search the entire area, and arrest everyone."

Bai Zhenzhen's face stiffened. "If I hear the contents of those cultivation techniques, will I be arrested too?"

The man comforted her, "Don't worry. Just work hard inside, and the gang will pay to pull some strings and get you out as soon as possible."

"After you go in and serve a few years of hard labor and pay off the fine, you'll be a big shot. Your benefits will be on par with a golden teacher's."

Another person nearby suddenly looked at Bai Zhenzhen and said, "Are you scared? If you're scared, give the opportunity to me. I'll go."

Hearing this, several others looked over, their expressions predatory, as if they all wanted to snatch this chance.

After all, for them, serving a few years in exchange for becoming a big shot was a golden opportunity to turn their lives around.

Looking at the eager faces of the others, Bai Zhenzhen suddenly laughed to herself. _Really... After hanging out with Yu-boy, my life seems to have gotten a bit too comfortable. I forgot that for poor people like us to climb up, isn't this how we have to fight? By seizing every single opportunity?_

Bai Zhenzhen looked at the man, licked her lips, and said, "If I drop the copyright bomb and manage to run out before the company's security forces search the place, without being taken away..."

"Can the gang directly transfer me the money that was... prepared to be used to pull strings for me?"

The man's eyebrow shot up with interest. "Run out before the security forces make their move? If you're really that fast, then I'll make the decision. That sum is 500,000. It can be transferred directly to you."

"Also, once you're out, you can lead a small team and watch over a territory, with a base salary of 800,000 a month."

More than half an hour later, an incredibly powerful and resonant sound erupted from deep within the cemetery, as if countless people were chanting cultivation techniques from the depths of the earth.

A few seconds later, a bolt of electricity lit up the night sky, like a flash of lightning in the darkness, striking towards the cemetery gate.

At the same time, someone shouted, "Don't let him get away!"

And in the woods surrounding the cemetery, the Deep Sea Group's security forces were already rushing over in a series of afterimages.

Amidst the flashing electricity, Bai Zhenzhen's nervous system was frantically transmitting every piece of information she could perceive.

Under this massive influx of information, the entire world seemed to slow down in Bai Zhenzhen's perception.

Within her body, the muscles in her legs erupted with violent force, her heart pumped furiously to supply blood, thunder magic power gushed from her body like plasma, and the True Spiritual Root permeated her entire being, making her every action incredibly precise, not wasting a single bit of explosive power...

At this moment, every part of Bai Zhenzhen's body was frantically accelerating for her! Faster! And faster still!

Outside, the shouts behind her grew more and more distant as she gradually left them behind.

The sound of rushing air from outside the cemetery grew louder and more urgent; this was the Deep Sea Group's security forces closing in.

And ahead, the cemetery gate was slowly closing, with several guards blocking Bai Zhenzhen's path, attempting to stop her.

But in Bai Zhenzhen's eyes, these guards were riddled with openings, with no coordination among them.

In her perception, with just a few flickers, she bypassed the guards' sluggish attempts to block her and, with a _swoosh_, leaped out of the cemetery gate.

And in the guards' eyes, they only saw a flash of electricity, and the person had already vanished into the night sky.

Several hours later, the man looked at the Bai Zhenzhen before him and praised, "As swift as thunder, as fast as lightning. With such nimble movement skills, it's a real waste you're not a delivery driver. Why did you decide to join a gang?"

"For the fast money, of course," Bai Zhenzhen said. "Hurry up and send the money."

Seeing the 500,000 arrive in her account, a smile touched Bai Zhenzhen's lips as she thought, _With this, Yu-boy has become a golden teacher, and I've also made a name for myself in the gang._

_The final round of the Foundation Establishment exam... We will definitely win!_

As Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen frantically earned money in the Dark Learning Gang, their strength once again began to surge.

And time flew by as the two worked and cultivated, with the third round of the Foundation Establishment exam in January of the following year drawing ever closer.
