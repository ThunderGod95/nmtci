# Chapter 521: Rising Renown

Spirit Realm.

Artifact Refinement Department Classroom.

Unlike the Civil Engineering Department, many Artifact Refinement Department courses were accelerated within classrooms in the Spirit Realm.

This allowed Artifact Refinement students to learn more efficiently, but it also meant they had to pay significantly higher tuition fees.

However, for students admitted to the Artifact Refinement Department, the exorbitant tuition fees were the least of their financial concerns amidst the department's numerous expenses.

As the Magic Power Conduction class concluded, Zhang Yu stood up in the Spirit Realm classroom and approached the instructor.

The instructor, known as True Person Nine Refinements, was a doctoral graduate of Myriad Laws University's Artifact Refinement Department who had successfully remained on staff. Just over fifty years old, he was considered a young prodigy wherever he went.

Like most faculty and students in the Artifact Refinement Department, True Person Nine Refinements judged people primarily by their Bionics.

After all, the Path of Artifact Refinement was driven by wealth, and he considered financial resources the most critical criterion for selecting talent.

The most reliable way for Artifact Refinement students to assess wealth was, of course, by examining a person's Bionics.

To easily distinguish his students, True Person Nine Refinements annotated each one, displaying the notes within his Bionic Eye. This allowed him to manage them effectively, whether in the real world or the Spirit Realm.

Take, for example, the students in his current class.

Su Yunni, the class's top student, wore a high-end model from the Myriad Paths Artisan Sect. In True Person Nine Refinements' eyes, she glowed with a faint purple light, marking her as a "minor elite." Whether it was lab chores or outsourced projects from artifact refinement companies, he could immediately put her to work — she was excellent labor!

Zi Yunzhen, ranked fourth in the class, also wore Myriad Paths Artisan Sect gear, but her equipment was the basic model, radiating a faint blue light in True Person Nine Refinements' vision.

He considered such students mediocre. They often required extensive training before they could be productive, but their willingness to work hard made them suitable for tedious, dangerous, and dirty tasks. They still had their uses.

As for students secretly using secondhand Bionics or mid-range brands, there were typically only a few in each Artifact Refinement Department class.

In True Person Nine Refinements' eyes, they appeared as a sea of green, considered expendable resources among the students. Their greatest contribution to the artifact refinement industry was their spending while studying. Despite lacking the potential for the Artifact Refinement Department, a few of them still managed to enroll each year!

The remaining students, clad in low-end Bionics or even lacking any Bionics beyond their Bionic Eyes, were rarely seen outside the Artifact Refinement Department by True Person Nine Refinements.

To him, they appeared as a murky gray-black, their darkness intensifying with the lower total value of their Bionics.

University City teemed with such individuals, their value diminishing further with each year's population growth.

In True Person Nine Refinements' eyes, these black-clad figures resembled walking wet garbage, the only difference being that discarding them in a landfill would incur a fine!

He sometimes grudgingly admitted that Netherworld University handled this better. They regularly purged the city's low-end population, preventing the "wet garbage" from wandering freely.

This practice, akin to pouring poison into a river, effectively maintained the value of human life. By preventing overpopulation among the lower classes, it ensured that lives weren't devalued, allowing the poor to live with greater dignity.

As Zhang Yu approached, a large, dark gray shadow flickered in True Person Nine Refinements' eyes.

"Zhang Yu?" The name immediately surfaced in True Person Nine Refinements' mind. This student from the Civil Engineering Department, who wore the same four-year-old Bionic Eye, had left a deeper impression on him than any other student — a true enigma in his eyes.

According to True Person Nine Refinements' classification system, Zhang Yu should have been categorized as "wet waste."

Yet, given the Artifact Refinement Department's principle that no "wet waste" existed, and considering Zhang Yu's exceptional academic performance, he should have been classified as "human."

This contradiction made Zhang Yu seem like a mysterious, unknown species, leaving a profound impression on True Person Nine Refinements.

Zhang Yu said, "Teacher, I'd like to request a leave of absence."

"Why?" True Person Nine Refinements asked.

"I plan to work on the Heavenly Sun Radiance God prototype machine," Zhang Yu explained. "I'll need to spend more time in the laboratory studying, preparing, and accumulating the necessary technical skills."

Zhang Yu genuinely wanted to avoid spending more time in class. After all, he had not only already mastered the relevant material but had also gained a deep understanding through his artifact refinement techniques.

Zhang Yu's next goal was indeed the prototype machine for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God. To him, it was the perfect excuse to skip class, just like Civil Engineering students skipping class to work on construction sites!

True Person Nine Refinements frowned slightly. "You want to build the prototype machine for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God? Ambition is good, but the Path of Artifact Refinement requires a solid foundation. Magic Power Conduction is a fundamental course in artifact refinement. You should focus on mastering your current coursework first."

A student who had transferred from the Civil Engineering Department just two months ago claiming he wanted to build the prototype machine for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God? To True Person Nine Refinements, this sounded like utter nonsense. If he agreed so easily, wouldn't he be seen as a fool?

Anticipating this reaction, Zhang Yu immediately sent the data for the Two Extremes Yin-Yang Shield he had refined. He knew that no amount of verbal explanation could match the impact of showcasing his results directly.

The Two Extremes Yin-Yang Shield could switch between two defensive modes: the Blazing Flame Shield and the Profound Ice Shield. Moreover, after Zhang Yu's enhancements, it perfectly demonstrated his mastery of Magic Power Conduction.

When True Person Nine Refinements first saw the data for the magical artifact Zhang Yu had sent, he didn't think much of it. But as he studied it further, his eyebrows gradually arched in surprise. The more he looked, the more astonished he became!

"Did you really refine this yourself?" True Person Nine Refinements asked.

In his eyes, the Two Extremes Yin-Yang Shield was at the level of a senior student in the Artifact Refinement Department. The data also demonstrated Zhang Yu's exceptional grasp of Magic Power Conduction principles.

"Impressive," True Person Nine Refinements said with a slight smile. "Are you currently involved in any projects? Would you be interested in joining my team?"

At that moment, Zhang Yu was marked with a special purple aura in True Person Nine Refinements' eyes — a sign that he was a prime candidate to be put to work and help him earn money, like a top-tier draft animal.

"I'm quite busy these days," Zhang Yu replied, shaking his head. He had learned a great deal about the Artifact Refinement Department from Ye Xingli recently.

He knew that joining a teacher's laboratory meant sacrificing guidance and cultivation opportunities to become their constant drudge.

As for compensation, it might not even match what he could earn hauling trash at a construction site!

Zhang Yu had his own cultivation plan and money-making strategies, so he naturally didn't need to work for anyone else.

To him, the professor's guidance was less valuable than practicing on his own.

True Person Nine Refinements nodded and smiled. "Alright, contact me anytime if you're interested. You're always welcome here!"

On the other side of the classroom, most students had already disappeared after class.

Zi Yunzhen, however, deliberately lingered to eavesdrop on Zhang Yu's conversation with True Person Nine Refinements.

Seeing the professor's high regard for Zhang Yu, she was secretly astonished.

"This Zhang Yu... he's getting more impressive by the day!"

Since becoming Ye Xingli's assistant, Zi Yunzhen had often seen Zhang Yu practicing artifact refinement techniques in the laboratory and had witnessed him mastering several such techniques one after another.

Zhang Yu attributed this progress to the influence of the Soul Transformation Bionic, leaving Zi Yunzhen green with envy.

"I could also practice dual cultivation... I can even change my gender!"

Unfortunately, Zi Yunzhen had also undergone the compatibility test but failed to earn the Soul Transformation Bionic's favor.

As Zhang Yu's artifact refinement skills steadily improved and his expertise expanded, he began receiving more commissions, gradually gaining some recognition among the Artifact Refinement Department students.

Zi Yunzhen thought to herself, "But he's only a third-year student... is he already planning to build a prototype machine for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God? Isn't that too ambitious?"

Zi Yunzhen didn't think much of Zhang Yu's choice.

"What cultivation art the Soul Transformation Bionic transmits is entirely a matter of luck. How could it possibly help you complete the Heavenly Sun Radiance God?"

"He just got lucky. Does he really think he's an artifact refinement genius now?"

As Zhang Yu requested leave from his teachers, word spread among the Artifact Refinement Department students that he was preparing to refine the Heavenly Sun Radiance God prototype machine, further enhancing his reputation.

In the laboratory, Ye Xingli flicked her wrist, unfurling the Void Calamity Transformation Diagram.

Within the space enveloped by this military-grade magical artifact, airflow, temperature, humidity, spiritual energy, gravity... all the parameters shifted under Ye Xingli's control, creating the experimental environment she needed.

As she manipulated the diagram, a magical artifact on the workbench gradually disassembled, revealing its internal structure.

Across the laboratory, Zhang Yu, who was practicing artifact refinement techniques, suddenly frowned. "What's that pungent, irritating smell? Is it fiend energy?"

Ye Xingli nodded. "This is a magical artifact used by factories to purify Earthly Fiend Qi. But there was a malfunction, causing the fiend energy to leak."

"Normally, a small leak wouldn't be a problem. But it happened to seep into the water pipes beneath University City, contaminating the water supply with fiend energy!"

"Fortunately, the factory manager had a stroke of genius. He quickly mixed his own excrements into the pipes, claiming it was a sewage leak. In the end, not only did he avoid paying compensation, but he even charged the impoverished people who had taken the water for their meals!"

Zhang Yu reaffirmed his belief that in Kunxu, one must never be poor. Being poor meant not only being fed sewage but also having to pay for the privilege!

Meanwhile, Ye Xingli continued manipulating the Void Calamity Transformation Diagram while privately messaging Zhang Yu: "I heard you and the Teacher took leave to prepare for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God? You haven't given up yet?"

Zhang Yu replied: "No, I'm quite confident."

Seeing Zhang Yu's persistence, Ye Xingli didn't try to dissuade him further, but she cautioned: "If you're serious about this, remember to inquire about who else in the department plans to attempt the Heavenly Sun Radiance God in the coming years."

Although the higher-ups had never formally announced it, the number of Military Certificates issued each year was limited!

For military-grade magical artifacts like the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, typically only one certificate was granted per academic year!

Ye Xingli: "That's why everyone tries to get their intentions known within the department beforehand to avoid conflicts."

Ye Xingli: "Jin Jun"

Ye Xingli: "This Jin Jun is scheduled to complete the Refining of the Heavenly Sun Radiance God prototype machine starting this September in the next academic year. He's not your direct competitor. He's a friend of mine, so feel free to ask him for advice if you have any questions."

Hearing these words, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Next academic year?"

"It's almost June now. In just three months, it will be September, and the next academic year will begin. I'll be a senior!"

"Everyone assumes I've just started preparing to refine the Heavenly Sun Radiance God and that it will take several years to complete."

"But based on my current progress, I could finish the prototype machine by next academic year. That would put me in direct competition with Jin Jun!"

"If he secures the Military Certificate with the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, I'll have to wait until my fifth year!"

Inside the Spirit Realm Grotto-Heaven:

Jin Jun opened the Golden Core Direct Guidance and checked his Golden Core simulation score: 158312.

Checking his Golden Core simulation score daily to track his incremental progress had long been Jin Jun's habit.

His Spirit Realm Projection flickered, transforming into a three-meter-tall figure clad in golden Bionics.

Various parameters projected onto the Bionic's outer shell displayed the formidable capabilities of these Bionics, which he had either personally refined or enhanced twice.

As a master of the military-grade cultivation technique Grand Void Divine Artifact Strategy, his artifact refinement skills far surpassed those of most students in the Artifact Refinement Department.
