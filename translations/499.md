# Chapter 499: Mount Sumeru King Sutra

"Mount Sumeru King Sutra..."

As Zhang Yu watched Xiang Shan's single punch restore order to Mo Shangjin's inverted world, information about Xiang Shan's Cultivation Art flashed through his mind.

"The Celestial Monsters University's Civil Engineering Department's military-grade martial art: Mount Sumeru King Sutra."

"Like the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, it's a martial art that manipulates Earthly Fiend Gravity."

"However, unlike the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power's direct application, the Mount Sumeru King Sutra harnesses the weight of the earth. Each punch and kick carries the crushing weight of mountains, and during physical clashes, the force is transferred into the surrounding mountains and earth."

Observing Xiang Shan's recent clash with Mo Shangjin, Zhang Yu realized Xiang Shan had channeled the entire arena's weight into his strike.

After Mo Shangjin countered with his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, Xiang Shan redirected the force into the arena itself, suppressing the momentarily lifted battlefield back into place.

Following this exchange, both combatants' auras surged, preparing for their next clash.

Mo Shangjin's flesh rippled, and a crimson ribbon emerged from his back, coiling around his neck, shoulders, and arms. This was the Skin Bionic, one of the Seven Absolutes Bionics, capable of harnessing Mo Shangjin's Earthly Fiend Gravity to achieve antigravity flight.

In this state, Mo Shangjin needed almost no self-propulsion. Wherever his mind willed, his body would soar under the antigravity effect, allowing him to move through the sky with unparalleled agility, minimal energy expenditure, and lightning-fast reflexes.

This also conserved more of his strength for combat and construction.

As the crimson ribbon billowed, Mo Shangjin's figure flashed, rocketing toward the arena's ceiling. In the blink of an eye, he had ascended over a thousand meters.

"Xiang Shan! Don't endanger the spectators! Let's take this fight to the sky!"

With a savage grin, Xiang Shan's thick legs stomped through the air, creating visible ripples as he launched himself toward Mo Shangjin like a cannonball.

"Mo Shangjin, if you want to distance me from the earth to weaken my Mount Sumeru King Sutra, just say so! Why the pretense?"

As they spoke, the countless sand, earth, and civil engineering structures in the arena suddenly lightened. Terrifying power had coalesced in Xiang Shan's fist, distorting the air with visible ripples as he swung it savagely toward Mo Shangjin.

Simultaneously, Mo Shangjin formed a hand seal in the sky. His previously intact arms split apart, transforming into four limbs, each with hollowed-out sections.

These hollowed sections allowed the four arms to interlock seamlessly, maintaining the appearance of two normal arms when not in use, without straining his Bionic Synchronization Rate.

This was the Hand Bionic from the Seven Absolutes Bionic.

The upper two arms bent backward, forming a seal behind Mo Shangjin's head.

*Boom!*

An Earthly Fiend Gravity source materialized above Mo Shangjin's head, radiating waves of Earthly Fiend energy.

As these waves swept over Xiang Shan, he felt as if he had plunged into a pool of liquid mercury, his movements slowing involuntarily.

Xiang Shan showed no surprise at this effect. He had witnessed this technique during previous clashes with Mo Shangjin.

He knew that upon entering his four-armed state, Mo Shangjin's upper arms would maintain the hand seal, generating this gravity source and continuously accumulating power to intensify its gravitational pull.

Any attack approaching Mo Shangjin would be repelled by this gravity source, either slowing to a crawl or grinding to a halt.

But this wasn't enough to stop him.

"Mo Shangjin!"

"Come and fight!"

Xiang Shan's muscles bulged as he stepped forward again, shattering layers of airwaves and charging toward Mo Shangjin.

In the next instant, Xiang Shan felt another Earthly Fiend Gravity pulling him from afar, as if countless invisible hands were dragging him violently toward the ground.

"Zhang Yu..."

Xiang Shan's gaze sharpened, and he glanced down at Zhang Yu on the arena floor. As expected, Zhang Yu was channeling the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to pull on Xiang Shan's physical body.

Sensing Mo Shangjin and Zhang Yu simultaneously suppressing his physical body from above and below across the vast distance, Xiang Shan finally understood their strategy.

"You want to control me together and exhaust me?"

"Do you... think you can exhaust me?"

Xiang Shan roared, his vital energy and Magic Power surging violently. Under this intense flow, his skin began to transform visibly, gradually shifting from its original gray to a pure black.

As his skin darkened, crimson patterns emerged along his veins and arteries, forming intricate and magnificent spiritual energy circuits that glowed across his body.

Watching this scene, Zhang Yu's heart stirred. He knew that the human body's natural meridians and blood vessels could never appear so perfectly ordered; this must be the effect of the Bionic's modifications.

"Is that Xiang Shan's Military-Grade Bionic?"

Before Zhang Yu could ponder further, he suddenly felt the Earthly Fiend Gravity he had locked onto Xiang Shan vanish.

"What?"

After Xiang Shan's mid-air transformation into a blackened state, he resembled a slippery black fish. No matter how Zhang Yu unleashed his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, Xiang Shan effortlessly slid through each attack, proving impossible to lock onto.

Instead, Xiang Shan's speed increased rapidly. After a few aerial dashes, he was already before Mo Shangjin.

At that moment, Zhang Yu realized...

"He's not slipping away — he's absorbing the force."

"This guy's skin is continuously absorbing the Earthly Fiend Gravity we're applying, even converting it into kinetic energy to enhance his strikes. That's why it feels like he's slipping through our grasp."

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu activated the Treasure Appraisal Manual, and the Bionic Eye displayed the target's Bionic information.

"Calamity Flow Bright King Type Four: A Military-Grade Bionic capable of absorbing external forces and converting them into enhanced mobility... It's practically the bane of all Martial Dao Techniques."

"They call it a Skin Bionic, but it's practically a layer of armor. I doubt even the Primordial Magnetic Meridian Severing Hand could break through it from the outside."

As Zhang Yu pondered this, Xiang Shan had already closed the distance to Mo Shangjin again, his mountain-like fists hammering down relentlessly.

The gravity source above Mo Shangjin's head flickered, intensifying once more. Waves of Earthly Fiend energy swept across Xiang Shan's body, slightly weakening the force of his blows.

Simultaneously, Mo Shangjin clenched his five fingers into a fist. White steam billowed from his Hand Bionic as it automatically activated the Comet Bombardment technique. Gripping his fist like a meteor, he clashed head-on with Xiang Shan.

Amidst thunderous explosions, the two fighters traded blows in mid-air, their fists colliding with terrifying force. Like two thunder gods, they unleashed countless sonic booms that reverberated across the heavens and earth within seconds.

Yet with each impact, Mo Shangjin felt most of his power being absorbed by Xiang Shan's Skin Bionic, while the internal pressure within his own body steadily mounted under the relentless assault.

Suddenly, Mo Shangjin splayed his fingers wide. The artificial meridians in his arm vibrated violently as layers of Earthly Fiend Gravity converged, amplified, and erupted into a wave cannon blast aimed at the close-range Xiang Shan.

With a thunderous roar, the earth behind Xiang Shan erupted in violent upheaval.

The multi-meter-thick rock strata pulverized into fine dust under the relentless tremors, which, whipped into a frenzy by the gale, carved out a crater the size of a schoolyard.

Struck head-on, Xiang Shan bellowed, his tusks swelling to monstrous proportions as he relentlessly charged at Mo Shangjin once more.

Watching this, Mo Shangjin's heart sank. "Even the Earthly Fiend Gravity Wave Cannon of the Seven Absolutes Bionic is useless?"

Though each Seven Absolutes Bionic possessed unique strengths, greatly amplifying the power of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, Mo Shangjin understood... these were not military-grade Bionics.

Facing Xiang Shan, who was channeling the Mount Sumeru King Sutra through a military-grade Bionic, he found himself unable to withstand the assault head-on.

As he pondered, a hammer blow struck Mo Shangjin's chest, crushing him downward as if a mountain had collapsed upon him, sending him plummeting to the ground.

While Mo Shangjin and Xiang Shan clashed fiercely, Zhang Yu frantically flipped through the Treasure Appraisal Manual, searching for information on the Calamity Flow Bright King Type Four military-grade Bionic, all while desperately trying to disrupt their opponent.

"Welcome to the Extreme Tiger Group's introduction to military-grade Bionics..."

Watching Mo Shangjin being completely suppressed high in the sky, Zhang Yu cursed inwardly, "Damn these blasted ads!"

"Skip!"

As Spirit Coins burned, Zhang Yu forcefully skipped all the ads, finally revealing the introduction to the Extreme Tiger Group's Military-Grade Bionic.

"Myriad Paths Artisan Sect Statement... Huh?"

Zhang Yu confirmed it was indeed an Extreme Tiger Brand Military-Grade Bionic, but the first page displayed a statement from the Myriad Paths Artisan Sect. He muttered to himself, "Damn Extreme Tiger Brand! So this Military-Grade Bionic is a ripoff of our Myriad Paths Artisan Sect's design? They even forgot to change the company name in the statement?"

Zhang Yu remembered that the Myriad Paths Artisan Sect was a renowned enterprise within the Myriad Laws Lineage.

He quickly flipped through the introduction, noticing the faint watermark "Vajra Profound Creation" still visible on the screenshots. "Wait a minute... are all of you copying Vajra Profound Creation?"

Too annoyed to dwell on who was copying whom, Zhang Yu focused on the Military-Grade Bionic's specifications.

But the more he read, the more his brow furrowed. "In our current state, our chances in a direct confrontation are too slim. This Bionic is practically a counter to Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power."

With this thought, Zhang Yu's figure flashed, already moving according to his and Mo Shangjin's original plan: when unable to defeat Xiang Shan head-on, they would first eliminate his teammates.

Meanwhile, Xiang Shan, who had just knocked down Mo Shangjin with a single punch, reached out and grabbed the blood splattered from Mo Shangjin's body, then brought it to his mouth.

After swallowing Mo Shangjin's blood with a series of gulps, Xiang Shan finally turned his gaze toward Zhang Yu.

"Hmph."

"Giving up on a direct confrontation?"

"How disappointing."

As he spoke, Xiang Shan aimed his trunk at Zhang Yu's position. With a thunderous roar from his chest and abdomen, a barrage of dark beams shot toward Zhang Yu.

The black beams tore through the air with whistling sounds, scouring the ground and corroding the earth wherever they struck. Thick, acrid smoke billowed in their wake.

To survive at Celestial Monsters University, Xiang Shan's internal organs had long been transformed into a highly purifying Bionic, working in tandem with his Body Refinement Technique to constantly combat external pathogens, viruses, and even fiend energy.

The metabolic waste from this process — filtered from air, food, medicine, fiend energy, and various pollutants — became a highly concentrated toxin that Xiang Shan could expel through his nasal Bionic, unleashing it as a pollution cannon attack.
