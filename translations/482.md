# Chapter 482: Admonitions and Spiritual Roots

Wen Wuya mused inwardly, "It seems Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' views on Joyful Union University and Myriad Laws University are far more nuanced than I anticipated."

"Considering what just happened... the Dual Cultivation Path and the Extreme Emotion Dao are indeed fundamentally incompatible."

"This confirms that Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' prohibition against me spending money on Bai Zhenzhen has deeper implications."

Frowning slightly, Wen Wuya thought, "But if that's the case, are Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu destined to part ways?"

"Then I'll lose the chance to cultivate with both of them. I might even have to choose between them."

"Ah, Zhang Yu is already making advances toward me, and Bai Zhenzhen and I have finally started connecting more deeply through our daily Spirit Realm conversations. I had hoped we could cultivate together as a trio, but now... Ah, which one should I choose?"

Wen Wuya wondered inwardly, "Could I secretly maintain a relationship with Zhang Yu while continuing to interact with Bai Zhenzhen?"

As a series of thoughts flashed through Wen Wuya's mind like lightning, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' voice echoed again: "Hmm?"

With a soft hum, Wen Wuya felt his soul tremble within him. He quickly composed himself and replied respectfully, "Divine Monarch, I was merely interested in Myriad Laws University's experiments and wished to gather firsthand information."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said coolly, "I care not for your interest in Myriad Laws' experiments."

"But the matter of three cultivating together — don't even think about it."

Wen Wuya shuddered at these words, feeling as if countless sword lights had pierced his body.

"Has the Divine Monarch been watching me all along?" he wondered inwardly. "Did she see my recent actions and deduce my intentions?"

Regretting his failed scheme, Wen Wuya quickly replied, "I understand, Divine Monarch. I will never entertain such thoughts again."

"Go."

With that single word, Wen Wuya's vision erupted in a kaleidoscope of colors, and he vanished from the competition arena.

In the next instant, the Seven-Colored Radiance in the Spirit Realm vanished completely, and Bai Zhenzhen disappeared without a trace.

In the blink of an eye, Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen, and Wen Wuya had all departed, leaving behind a stadium full of Heavenly Sword University students feeling utterly lost and dejected.

On the Flying Boat, Su Yanyang, Shi Huaiyu, Xiao Yunji, and the others stood on the deck, their gazes occasionally drifting toward the cabin, their hearts brimming with curiosity.

Inside the cabin, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's Spirit Realm Projection orbited Zhang Yu, continuously casting talismans to conduct a thorough examination.

After a long silence, True Monarch Magnetic Pole finally spoke, her voice calm: "No issues detected. Heavenly Sword University likely didn't implant any surveillance methods on you."

"However, once you return to campus, you should immediately head to the laboratory for a more detailed check."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly, expressing his gratitude for True Monarch Magnetic Pole's assistance.

But True Monarch Magnetic Pole abruptly changed the subject: "Have you engaged in Dual Cultivation with anyone from Heavenly Sword University?"

Zhang Yu shook his head vehemently. "Absolutely not! How could I?"

"I have no interest in Dual Cultivation whatsoever. My entire focus during this trip to Heavenly Sword was on the competition."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole remained noncommittal, her tone even: "That's for the best. But I must warn you in advance: now that you carry the laboratory's research results, you should refrain from Dual Cultivation without explicit permission. Your partner might harbor ulterior motives and attempt to steal information from you."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole thought to herself that she hadn't anticipated the situation escalating so rapidly. Upon their return, she would need to revise Zhang Yu's contract to include specific clauses regarding Dual Cultivation.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole continued, "And... what exactly is your relationship with Bai Zhenzhen and Wen Wuya?"

Zhang Yu replied, "Bai Zhenzhen was my high school classmate. I met Wen Wuya through her. We occasionally communicate through the Spirit Realm Network. This time, since they knew I was coming to Heavenly Sword University, they suggested meeting up in person."

This information was easily verifiable, and Zhang Yu had no intention of lying.

Hearing Zhang Yu's explanation, True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "Contacting Wen Wuya occasionally is acceptable, but don't fall for his schemes or reveal any laboratory secrets to him. As for Bai Zhenzhen, it's best to avoid her altogether."

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback. "Why?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole explained, "Divine Monarch Seven Emotions is a master of the Demonic Path. While her Seven Emotions Sword Dao is considered a righteous technique, the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is a first-class demonic art. Unless one achieves Soul Transformation at a young age like Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, cultivating the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao goes against societal norms, violates public order and morality, and is rejected by the very fabric of heaven and earth. It harms both the practitioner and others, leaving behind endless calamity."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole looked at Zhang Yu solemnly. "That's why Divine Monarch Seven Emotions hasn't taken any disciples in a long time, and none of her former disciples met a good end."

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback, thinking of Bai Zhenzhen. He couldn't help but ask, "What happened to them?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied calmly, "Of the two I witnessed personally... one was ultimately refined into Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' personal Flying Sword."

Zhang Yu's heart sank, and his Magic Power stirred involuntarily within him.

"The other murdered his wife, slaughtered his children, and beheaded his grandchildren, all because they weren't blood relatives. He then destroyed his family's assets and drove himself into bankruptcy."

Zhang Yu was stunned, momentarily speechless.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole advised, "Therefore, those who become entangled with the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao rarely meet a good end. I don't know what kind of financial ties or debts you have with Bai Zhenzhen."

"But I urge you, if you owe her money, repay it quickly and sever all contact. If she owes you money, let a small debt go. For larger sums... recover as much as you can immediately. After that, never meet Bai Zhenzhen again."

Zhang Yu opened his mouth, unsure how to respond to True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

However, she didn't seem to expect an immediate answer, instead continuing, "Now, tell me about your Cultivation Art breakthrough. What did you feel when your Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power reached levels 17 and 18?"

While Zhang Yu and True Monarch Magnetic Pole were conversing on the flying boat, at Heavenly Sword University, in a pure white room containing only a meditation cushion and a longsword, Bai Zhenzhen sat cross-legged on the cushion, silently sensing something.

Since her Divine Spiritual Root had merged with Zhang Yu's, she had noticed a mysterious transformation occurring within her.

To better describe this phenomenon internally, Bai Zhenzhen had named her own Divine Spiritual Root the True Spirit Root and Zhang Yu's the Feather Spirit Root.

"After the Feather Spirit Root entered, my True Spirit Root began adapting to it."

"Then the Feather Spirit Root seemed to start adapting to the True Spirit Root, followed by the True Spirit Root adapting to the Feather Spirit Root again..."

Bai Zhenzhen felt as if the two Divine Spiritual Roots had transformed into the black and white halves of the Taiji symbol, constantly rotating, chasing each other, and gradually merging into a primordial chaos.

Magic Power circulated through Bai Zhenzhen's body, and she felt her True Spirit Root subtly adjusting every part of her being. The nature of this adjustment was both incredibly comprehensive and almost imperceptible.

"What a pity, it was still too short," Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself. "Just as I was starting to sense something, the Feather Spirit Root withdrew."

"If it had lasted longer, would it have brought about greater changes?"

With this thought, Bai Zhenzhen found herself eagerly anticipating her next encounter with Zhang Yu, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her lips.

But in the very next moment, the dormitory door burst open, and a corpse was hurled inside.

The instant Bai Zhenzhen saw the corpse, crimson sword qi materialized out of thin air, swirling around her like living entities and emitting sharp, piercing sword cries.

The meditation cushion beneath her feet was instantly shredded, and the surrounding walls were crisscrossed with countless sword slashes.

Yet just as suddenly as they had appeared, the sword qi vanished, dissipating into the air like a phantom.

Bai Zhenzhen gazed at the corpse before her — identical to Zhang Yu — and said, "Mom, do you believe me now?"

"I was only slightly startled at first. Even though my rational mind immediately recognized that the corpse before me couldn't be real, the emotional surge upon seeing it directly triggered my Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, unleashing those sword qi uncontrollably."

"Emotion precedes intent, and the sword follows thought. My Extreme Emotion Sword Dao has already broken through to level 10."

With a soft *shush*, the corpse shattered into countless microscopic sword lights, dissolving into dust that vanished into the atmosphere, gently carried out of the dormitory by the breeze.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions spoke calmly, "Zhang Yu, regardless of your personal temperament, consider your current position at the heart of the storm between Myriad Laws University and Joyful Union University."

"How much opportunity do you think you'll have to participate in Dual Cultivation technology research in the future?"

"As a Civil Engineering student, would you willingly abandon such opportunities?"

"Even if you wanted to, would you truly have the freedom to choose?"

"The more you advance now, the more terrifying the backlash will be later."

"Rebuild your foundation."

"Otherwise, become my Flying Sword, another addition to the Sword Pavilion's collection."

Myriad Laws University, University City.

Just as Zhang Yu was returning to Myriad Laws University, True Monarch Magnetic Pole received a flurry of messages.

True Monarch Celestial Seal: "Zhang Yu has broken through again?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Keep it low-key."

True Monarch Celestial Seal: "Magnetic Pole, no offense, but what's the point of researching the Immortal Dao if you're going to be so low-key?"

True Monarch Celestial Seal: "The university leaders are waiting for us to produce results."

True Monarch Celestial Seal: "Next year's funding, the number of publications, and everyone's performance evaluations all depend on this. You can't just think about yourself!"

True Monarch Celestial Seal: "I've already reported the matter. Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations is very pleased, and the Finance Department is willing to invest."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole shook her head helplessly as she read the messages. "This guy... he's truly willing to risk his life for money."

Meanwhile, True Monarch Magnetic Pole continued reviewing the messages from others. Some wanted to invest, others wanted to insert their own people, some wanted to borrow Yin Artifacts, and others simply demanded data...

"Sigh, I knew it would come to this."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed, sensing an inevitable storm brewing.

"In all of Myriad Laws, there isn't even room for a quiet laboratory."
