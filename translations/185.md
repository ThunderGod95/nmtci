# Chapter 185: Layers of Restraint

In the model class classroom.

Su Haifeng stood at the podium. As the grade director of Songyang High School, a man whose mere presence could make a passing dog stop and study, he caused the students to tense up, their focus sharpening to a razor's edge.

The content of Su Haifeng's speech sent ripples of unease through the students, leaving many at a loss.

"...Recently, some students have demonstrated a weak sense of discipline, with unexcused absences being particularly common. This not only severely impacts your own academic progress but also undermines the learning atmosphere of the entire class and, indeed, the entire school."

"The school has a zero-tolerance policy for such behavior and will conduct strict investigations henceforth. Any student found with an unexcused absence will receive a corresponding demerit."

"Do not underestimate these demerits. A single one means an indelible mark on your student record. An accumulation of three demerits will result in immediate expulsion."

"Perhaps some of you think, 'So what if I'm expelled? I'll just find another school.' But I must sound a warning bell for you. Once expelled, you will be placed on the education system's blacklist."

"Once you are on this blacklist, you will be barred from the university entrance exams, and no high school or university will accept you."

"This means your journey on the Immortal Dao will be cut short..."

Qian Shen raised his hand. "Do we have to attend every single session of the general knowledge courses?"

Su Haifeng replied as if it were obvious, "Naturally. Absence from any course, including general knowledge, will be treated as an unexcused absence."

From his desk, Zhang Yu felt Su Haifeng's gaze repeatedly sweep over him as he spoke, feeling as though the words were aimed directly at him.

As Su Haifeng looked at Zhang Yu, he thought to himself, _The inspection team has finally shifted some of its attention away from us. The most urgent task now is to seize this opportunity, capture the evil god behind Zhang Yu, and use it to enhance the master's status._

Zhang Yu, as a mere high school student, even a so-called top student... was nothing to be feared in Su Haifeng's eyes. He could easily suppress the boy himself if he chose.

_The key issue has always been the evil god behind him._

_We must not reveal our intentions. Otherwise, given the cautious nature of evil gods, it would likely abandon Zhang Yu and flee._

_We must have Zhou Chechen apply pressure on him, bit by bit, forcing him to the point where he actively seeks the evil god's help..._

With this in mind, Su Haifeng's gaze merely flickered past Zhang Yu, and he said no more on the matter.

As for how the changes to the school rules might affect student performance? That was the last thing on Su Haifeng's mind, to say nothing of the Zhou family elders behind him.

After all, these students of a key high school, who were seen as prodigies by many, were nothing more than resources to Su Haifeng and his superiors, resources that grew in large batches every year.

At most, some were domesticated, others were wild; some would provide value through their future labor, while others would provide value through their organs.

And as long as they could achieve their objective—enhancing the evil god's status to face the coming tide of the era—what did sacrificing the interests of a few students matter?

During the subsequent math class, every student remained dutifully in the classroom.

When the math teacher entered, he looked out at the perfectly seated, fully present class with a sense of unfamiliarity.

However, after teaching for a short while, he felt a surge of pride and exhilaration.

Meanwhile, other teachers patrolled the corridors, constantly checking on the classroom situations.

Feeling Su Haifeng's piercing, electric gaze upon them, the students remained on high alert, daring not to make a single wrong move.

_What a hassle._

_Sitting obediently through math class is a complete waste of time._

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _At least I can still practice my heart art and breathing exercises._

He glanced at Bai Zhenzhen not far away, who was clutching a power bank, and knew that she was also seizing the time to charge up and perform her breathing exercises.

Zhang Yu then mused, _But for the other classes, given my friendly relationships with the teachers, I should have a bit more freedom, right?_

On the training grounds.

The martial arts teacher, Lei Jun, called Zhang Yu aside.

Zhang Yu asked, "Teacher, for the upcoming martial arts classes, can I still find a place to cultivate by myself?"

Hearing Zhang Yu's question, Lei Jun sighed helplessly. "Not anymore, Zhang Yu. The rules are extremely strict right now. If you skip class, not only will you get a demerit, but I'll be reprimanded and have my performance bonus and salary docked."

Zhang Yu frowned slightly at these words. There were many cultivation techniques he preferred not to practice in front of his classmates and teachers.

"But there are benefits, too. To improve results, the school has created a special subsidy program for outstanding students like you."

"For instance, during martial arts class, to help you solidify your foundation, the school has tasked me with teaching you various basic cultivation techniques, free of charge..."

As he spoke these words, Lei Jun felt a pang of guilt.

With his many years of experience as a high school martial arts teacher, he knew very well that one should not practice too many different basic cultivation techniques.

The idea of practicing numerous basic techniques to "solidify the foundation" was a relic from ancient sects, a method for those whose cultivation was planned out over decades. It had long been rendered obsolete by the modern era.

In the high-stakes environment of high school, where every second counted, there were countless methods superior to and faster than basic cultivation techniques for consolidating one's foundation. Practicing too many basic techniques was tantamount to wasting time.

_Zhou Chechen is making Zhang Yu practice basic cultivation techniques in every martial arts class. That's the same as making him waste his time, squandering his potential._

Despite this, Lei Jun did not intervene.

_After all, Zhou Chechen managed to persuade the principal and the school board directly this time._

_This means that to deal with Zhang Yu, Zhou Chechen has likely mobilized the power of the Zhou family._

_Faced with a behemoth like one of the sixteen great clans, I am just an ordinary employee. Zhang Yu is just a student. What power do we have to resist?_

As for transferring schools, Lei Jun sighed. That would require Songyang High School's approval, and just dealing with the student records and compensation would be a nightmare. They could easily fabricate the school's 'investment' in the student and demand an exorbitant fee. What other high school would be willing to take him on?

Lei Jun had heard that a coach had scouted Zhang Yu during the last competition, but Zhou Chechen had declared he wouldn't let him go. He also heard that Zhang Yu had stopped participating in competitions since then, which likely made even fewer schools willing to pay a high price for him.

Having worked and cultivated in Songyang City for so long, Lei Jun was all too aware of the Zhou family's influence. It was not something an ordinary student or teacher could possibly stand against.

_If I defy them, I'll probably become one of those 'optimized' middle-aged men, forced to search everywhere for a job, only to be rejected due to my age, eventually ending up as a courier or a delivery driver._

_Then, under 360-degree surveillance, I'd work myself to death, my every bathroom break, meal, and step strictly monitored. I'd wear a professional smile-mask, be trampled on by customers, security guards, and managers, unable to pay off my loans unless I worked over 200 hours of overtime every month... a piece of human scum._

_If I'm lucky, I'll work hard, use the money to maintain my cultivation, and die of old age after a full career._

_If I'm unlucky, if I injure someone while making a delivery, or get beaten up by a security guard, I'll end up unable to repay my loans due to insufficient work hours and be forced to sell my own flesh and blood._

_I'd watch myself slowly revert to a common old man, bullied by other mortals for being a former cultivator, and finally die stinking in some sewer..._

The mere thought filled Lei Jun with immense terror.

_No... I've cultivated for so many years. I can't end up like that._

On the other hand, if he did as Zhou Chechen instructed, not only would he avoid being 'optimized,' but Zhou Chechen would also help pay off his university loans.

At this thought, Lei Jun sighed deeply, unable to meet Zhang Yu's eyes.

As a teacher, Lei Jun admired Zhang Yu's talent and achievements, but as a man of Kunxu, he knew that money in hand was what mattered most.

_I'm sorry, Zhang Yu. But you can't get into the Ten Greats anyway, so what difference does it make if your grades are a little better or worse? You might as well do me this favor._

However, to show some small consideration, Lei Jun decided to grant him a degree of choice.

He continued, "As long as it's a basic cultivation technique that Songyang High School is authorized to teach, you can pick any one you want. I'll teach it to you and have the school grant you the usage rights."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's eyes brightened slightly. "What other basic cultivation techniques can we learn at this school?"

Lei Jun reeled them off with practiced ease, "Besides the ones you've already been taught, there's the Basic Saber Technique, Basic Footwork, Basic Digestion Method, High School Basic Medicine-Taking Method..."

Listening to Lei Jun expertly list the names of the basic cultivation techniques, Zhang Yu took out his phone, noted them down, and then logged into a shopping website to search for them, reading through the description of each one.

_Hmm, this Basic Footwork can contribute to the High School Sacred Body in the Technique-Chaining Diagram._

_And there's Basic Digestion Method, Basic Medicine-Taking Method..._

_Excellent, excellent. Songyang High School is truly worthy of being a key high school. Its collection of basic cultivation techniques is very comprehensive, enough for me to assemble the entire High School Sacred Body._

With this in mind, Zhang Yu looked at Lei Jun with a revitalized expression.

"In that case, I'll learn the HBasic Digestion Method first."

Seeing the boy's determined expression, Lei Jun sighed inwardly but said nothing more. Instead, he began to personally instruct him in the basic technique.

The Basic Digestion Method was a technique that used various fundamental movements and magic power circulation to stimulate gastrointestinal motility, enhancing digestion and absorption.

After two consecutive martial arts classes, Lei Jun watched as a deep, rolling thunder-like sound emanated from within Zhang Yu's body. He thought to himself, _He's learned it already? So fast._

_A pity that such talent will now be wasted on constantly practicing basic cultivation techniques..._

Zhang Yu, however, was pleased as he looked at his Feather Book. The High School Basic Digestion Method had already reached level 3 (5/30).

Although the technique was at level 3, Zhang Yu did not reveal it, simply continuing to feign the clumsy movements of a beginner. For him, practicing this way still raised the technique's level all the same.

After martial arts class, the students of the model class proceeded together to the gymnasium for their P.E. class.

But this time, besides Wang Hai, another P.E. teacher was present in the gymnasium.

Then, to everyone's surprise, Wang Hai announced, "Everyone, from now on, your second-year P.E. classes will be taught by Teacher Lin Hui here. Teacher Lin Hui is highly skilled; you should all learn from her diligently."

The P.E. teacher beside Wang Hai—two and a half meters tall and two meters wide, their gender impossible to discern from their physique alone—smiled slightly.

"Hello, students. The school places great importance on the P.E. curriculum for the model class."

"To better improve everyone's physical education results, the school has decided to distribute a complimentary dose of Dragon-Elephant Preparation during every P.E. class from now on."

Hearing this, many of the students cheered. Even Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's eyes lit up, as they thought, _This wretched Songyang High School is actually capable of doing something so generous?_

Wang Hai stood to the side, silently observing Lin Hui distribute the Dragon-Elephant Preparation and watching the students joyfully receive and inject the alchemical enhancer, his mind replaying a previous conversation with Zhou Chechen.

_Am I really supposed to add an addictive substance to Zhang Yu's Dragon-Elephant Preparation?_

Originally, Zhou Chechen had intended to assign this task to Wang Hai, offering a reward so generous that even Wang Hai found it incredibly tempting.

Furthermore, it had been confirmed that Zhang Yu was not a Golden Core disciple, his sponsor Zhang Pianpian had left the first layer of Kunxu without a trace, and Zhou Chechen was already mobilizing the Zhou family's resources...

Everything seemed to indicate that Wang Hai should accept the offer.

But in the end, Wang Hai chose to neither oppose, nor support, nor participate.

It was because he could not make sense of the situation.

He could neither understand why Zhang Yu was progressing so rapidly, nor whether Zhang Yu had a backer, nor whether Zhou Chechen's actions were motivated by revenge or some other purpose...

As an ace P.E. coach who had worked at Songyang High School for decades, Wang Hai had always lived by one principle.

If he couldn't understand a situation, he wouldn't get involved, no matter how profitable it seemed.
