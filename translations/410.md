# Chapter 410: How Many Junior College Students for a Handful?

Hearing Xiao Qingxuan's words, Zhang Yu nodded and said, "I've heard a little about it."

Xiao Qingxuan continued, "After that ancient Golden Core cultivator possessed me, he didn't actually intend to kill me. In fact, he taught me quite a lot. He planned to return my physical body to me once he found a new one."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Kunxu has such kind people?"

Xiao Qingxuan said, "According to this ancient Golden Core cultivator..."

"He claimed to be a righteous cultivator from the Supreme Dao Sect, participating in the Righteous-Demonic War. He was severely wounded and placed in a tomb by his fellow sect members to hibernate, slowing his lifespan consumption while gradually healing his injuries."

"When he awoke, his original physical body had already decayed, leaving him no choice but to possess mine."

Zhang Yu thought, "Supreme Dao Sect? I've never heard of that sect before. Could it be an extinct sect?"

"If this ancient Golden Core cultivator and Xiao Qingxuan had no conflict, how did he end up owing so much money? And where did the ancient Golden Core cultivator go? Could he have already found a new physical body?"

Just as Zhang Yu's mind flooded with more questions, Xiao Qingxuan continued, "At first, I got along well with this ancient cultivator. But as he learned more about Kunxu, his mental state deteriorated rapidly."

"In the end, he took his own life."

"Ah?" Zhang Yu exclaimed in surprise. "Suicide?"

Xiao Qingxuan nodded. "Demons Arrive in the Nine Heavens, the Dao Perishes, Heaven Collapses... After uttering those words, he severed his connection to my physical body and declared he was going to end his life."

"What he chose to do was beyond my control. The real problem is that he left behind remnants — memories, habits, and ways of thinking... They've influenced me, making me feel like an outsider in this world."

"Things I used to take for granted now fill me with revulsion, even disgust. I've become like a rigid, old-fashioned ancient person..."

As he spoke, Xiao Qingxuan's face twisted with anguish.

"Take the Dual Rest Cult's recent uproar. Every time I see news about it, I feel deeply unsettled, as if there's another 'me' inside my head..."

Seeing the fleeting struggle on Xiao Qingxuan's face, Zhang Yu felt a flicker of understanding for his friend's predicament.

When Zhang Yu first arrived in Kunxu, he too had struggled to adapt.

But now it seemed this ancient Golden Core cultivator's discomfort in Kunxu... far surpassed his own.

Though Zhang Yu still harbored many questions — such as the Golden Core cultivator's final fate, the exact method of their suicide, and the mystery of Xiao Qingxuan's ten thousand Spirit Coin debt — he refrained from pressing further, sensing Xiao Qingxuan's distress. He knew the man would share what he was willing to share, and forcing the issue would only be futile.

Instead, Zhang Yu patted Xiao Qingxuan's shoulder reassuringly. "It'll get better with time, right?"

Xiao Qingxuan let out a bitter laugh. "If only it were that simple."

"A Golden Core True Person's information capacity is more than ten times mine. Even a fragment of their memories left behind has an overwhelming impact on me."

"The only solution... is Heavenly Demon University's memory erasure technology. I need to find a way to wipe the Golden Core's residual memories from my mind."

Xiao Qingxuan sighed heavily.

In the Spirit Realm's simulation laboratory, Zhang Yu completed another Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch, finally advancing his Artifact Refinement Technique to Level 9.

As a magical artifact refinement technique for the Qi Refining stage, the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch's production skill could only reach Level 10 at most.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Next, I'll return to the physical world's laboratory and use my Level 9 Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch technique to upgrade the artifact's level."

He remembered that his physical world's Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch was still only at Level 1. This would allow him to temper the artifact, raise its level, and refine his artifact refinement technique, ultimately pushing the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch's refinement technique to Level 10.

"Once I advance the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch's refinement technique to Level 10, I can learn the advanced techniques and master the production of the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill."

Despite its name, the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill was actually a magical artifact corresponding to the Foundation Establishment Stage. It was an advanced artifact refinement technique that could only be learned after mastering Level 10 of the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch technique.

Moreover, among the artifacts taught in the Artifact Refinement Department's first three years of curriculum, Zhang Yu felt this particular artifact suited him best.

However, glancing at his remaining thirty-odd Spirit Coins, Zhang Yu knew he would soon be facing a significant financial drain.

Yin Jiurao gazed at Wan Sirou, who appeared within the Bionic Eye, and said coldly, "Still no success?"

"My patience has its limits."

"It's been three days past the deadline you promised for stealing the seed."

Wan Sirou swallowed hard and said helplessly, "This target's dao heart is exceptionally firm, and he also suffers from severe mental issues."

"Initially, I disguised myself as a massage therapist and used the Divine Spirit Technique to amplify my charm, but I couldn't stir his desires."

"Later, still posing as a massage therapist, I claimed to use Magic Power for therapeutic massage and secretly injected Aphrodisiac Magic Power into his body to trigger his physiological responses... but he immediately switched therapists."

A flash of humiliation crossed Wan Sirou's face as she continued, "To be replaced after using aphrodisiacs... this has never happened to me before."

"It was only when I saw the therapist he switched to that I realized his aesthetic preferences differed from what I'd predicted."

Wan Sirou asserted, "Years of academic and cultivation pressure have likely warped his mind, completely alienating him. He now seeks out the most unconventional and retro styles among university students..."

Yin Jiurao interrupted, "I didn't come here to hear your excuses."

Wan Sirou said, "This isn't an excuse, but an objective analysis of the target."

"Later, I tried pretending to invite him to test our product as a long-term user of Joyful Union Video. I disguised my Bionic as the product and sent it to him for evaluation..."

Yin Jiurao's heart stirred. She knew that Joyful Union cultivators possessed unique Bionic structures, all produced by the Yin-Yang Heavenly Dao company. These Yin-Yang Bionics were essential tools for their cultivation, work, and production.

Not only were these Bionics incredibly potent in the Yin-Yang Harmonious Union Dao, but they were also integral parts of the cultivators' bodies.

If Zhang Yu had used Wan Sirou's Bionic, she could have remotely harvested his seed.

But Wan Sirou continued, "Even so, he never used it once. Instead, his roommate, Yu Xinghan, used it several times."

Wan Sirou shook her head. "Faced with Joyful Union University's latest product, a rooted man like him didn't use it even once. This shows his extraordinary ability to suppress his desires..."

Wan Sirou then recounted her various attempts in detail, concluding, "His dao heart is as firm as iron. Ordinary methods won't work for Seed Deception."

"The Yin-Yang Great Dao: the superior path cultivates emotion, while the inferior path seeks desire."

"To capture him, we must cultivate emotion, but that requires time..."

Yin Jiurao frowned. "How much time?"

Wan Sirou replied, "Six months to a year. If you agree, I can begin a new plan next week, but it will cost more."

"Of course, if you're not willing to accept, I can refund a portion of the payment."

After ending the communication with Wan Sirou, Yin Jiurao thought to herself, "Zhang Yu is so cautious and guarded. He must be hiding something significant."

"A long-term plan?"

Yin Jiurao's brow furrowed deeper as she recalled several stalled research projects.

As a professor at Myriad Laws University, she was subject to performance evaluations, often facing even greater pressure than her students.

With tensions rising and pharmaceutical companies aggressively expanding production and markets, if she failed to produce results soon...

A glint flashed in Yin Jiurao's eyes.

"I don't have time for this."

"It seems I'll have to resort to more direct methods."

Inside the Artifact Refinement Laboratory, Zhang Yu was refining his Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch alone.

He had chosen to work alone, without sharing the laboratory rental costs with Ye Xingli, because he didn't want to reveal the rapid progress he was making.

Currently, he was operating the laboratory equipment, channeling Magic Power into it while repeatedly tempering the Level 1 magical artifact, the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch, with his Gang Qi.

"After a magical artifact is refined, its level can be further enhanced through subsequent refinement."

"However, there are many refinement methods. Some involve strengthening or even changing the materials, while others focus on adjusting the Magic Power Circuit, enhancing the artifact's restrictions, or even utilizing Dragon Veins, the sun and moon, Qi Luck, or blood sacrifices."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "I'm currently using the tempering method inherent in the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch's original refinement technique to improve the artifact's quality. I wonder if this will..."

After completing one cycle of tempering, Zhang Yu checked his Feather Book entry for the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch and noticed that the refinement count had increased by one.

Zhang Yu smiled faintly, thinking to himself, "As expected, beyond the initial magical artifact Refining, subsequent Magical Artifact Tempering can also be used to improve my Artifact Refinement Technique level."

Just as Zhang Yu was diligently practicing his magical artifact techniques, Feng Tingting sent him another message.

Feng Tingting: "Have you heard? A student in the Artifact Refinement Department lost a bet with their Mentor."

Zhang Yu asked curiously, "A bet?"

Feng Tingting: "Yeah, he was Tempering his own Bionic. If he didn't meet the Mentor's requirements, all his Bionics would be confiscated and converted into magical artifact."

Feng Tingting: "Sigh, you really shouldn't make bets like that lightly."

After chatting casually with Feng Tingting for a while, Zhang Yu suddenly noticed a friend request from someone named Yin Jiurao.

Seeing that she identified herself as a Professor in the Pharmacology Department at Myriad Laws University, Zhang Yu immediately accepted.

Her first message stunned him:

"To summarize... one shot, 5 Spirit Coins."

Zhang Yu firmly replied, "I don't do that kind of business."

Yin Jiurao: "10 Spirit Coins."

Zhang Yu reluctantly refused, "I really can't."

Yin Jiurao: "20 Spirit Coins, but I need to inspect the goods first."

Yin Jiurao: "Just a reminder: 20 Spirit Coins is more than enough for me to forcefully take what I want, pay the fines, and cover any damages."

Yin Jiurao: "I'm trying to do legitimate business, build a long-term partnership, and I'm giving you a fair deal because you're from our school."

Seeing this message, Zhang Yu couldn't help but curse inwardly, "This damn Kunxu... Does anyone here have any morals? They implement Dual Rest, and everyone's scrambling to exploit it. Teachers steal students' seeds and just pay a fine and compensation."

Zhang Yu: "If you try anything forceful, Director Gao behind me won't let you get away with it."

Yin Jiurao: "What about Director Gao? If I offer him enough money, won't he sell out too?"

Yin Jiurao: "30 Spirit Coins, including blood and other materials. This is my final offer."

Yin Jiurao: "Think carefully. With this one deal, you could crush countless Junior College Students financially. Opportunities like this don't come every day."

Zhang Yu: "I need to consider it."
