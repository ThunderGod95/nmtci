# Chapter 427: The Divine Monarch's Grand Wedding

True Monarch Celestial Elephant, standing nearby, listened to True Monarch Cloud Haven's words and nodded. "True Monarch Cloud Haven, your Civil Engineering Department at Myriad Laws University truly boasts a wealth of talent, each with their own strengths."

"It seems that beyond this graduating class, the next one will also produce talents capable of obtaining the Military Certificate."

True Monarch Cloud Haven smiled faintly. "It can't compare to your Celestial Monster University's Civil Engineering Department. You've claimed first place in the Civil Engineering Inter-University Competition for the past few years."

True Monarch Celestial Elephant laughed heartily. "This year might be different." He pointed at Ping Han. "Isn't this Tenth-Year Student on Mo Shangjin's team?"

"He's been accumulating experience for years. If he obtains the Military Certificate this time, he'll likely master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power immediately!"

"Then your Civil Engineering Department will have a team with both Mo Shangjin and him — two individuals who have mastered military-grade martial arts!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven smiled without comment. In his view, Ping Han securing the Military Certificate would indeed be the best outcome.

"Xiao Yunji is exceptional, but she could benefit from two more years of refinement."

"Zhang Yu will be sent to the Artifact Refinement Department's Magnetic Pole anyway!"

"If Pinghan secures the Military Certificate, he can team up with Mo Shangjin to make a strong push in the Civil Engineering Inter-University Competition. Maybe they'll even have a shot at first place!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven was clearly more concerned with the overall performance of the Civil Engineering Department than individual achievements.

Myriad Laws University's Civil Engineering Department hadn't won the Civil Engineering Inter-University Competition in years.

If this year's team could finally break the drought, it would be a feather in the cap for the Vice Principal in charge of academic affairs.

Meanwhile, Director Gao was meticulously observing the students' performances from the sidelines.

Suddenly, Director Lin appeared beside him, chuckling softly. "Zhang Yu's Minor Threefold Combination is quite impressive, and his construction skills are top-notch. He's truly maximizing every ounce of his effort!"

"But ultimately, he can't match Ping Han's prowess in coin speculation."

Director Lin turned to Director Gao, his tone casual. "Seeing how even the War Faction students are relying on coin speculation for breakthroughs and shining in the Coin Dao, Old Gao, doesn't that give you any thoughts?"

Director Gao retorted coldly, "Even if Ping Han secures the Military Certificate today, it's the culmination of years of accumulated effort. The surge in Jade Nectar Coin value is merely a catalyst!"

Director Lin shook his head and sighed, "Old Gao, the Finance Department has the money, and we have the manpower. Following their lead to acquire land and capital, and developing real estate and finance — it's a win-win for everyone. I simply don't understand why you War Faction members are so stubbornly resistant."

Director Gao countered, "I don't understand either. How can you trust those Finance Department vultures who'd skin a passing dog alive? The war has already reached the Upper College level, yet some still close their eyes and pretend it isn't happening?"

Director Lin sighed, "Gao Chongguang, you've been hauling bricks for too long — it's addled your mind!"

Meanwhile, aboard the Flying Boat, the judges and guests observed the examination and engaged in lively discussions.

On the battlefield, the assault intensified. Yellow Turban Warriors of various forms appeared in succession, wielding increasingly powerful weapons and unleashing devastating forces.

Gang Qi swept wildly, and Thunderfire raged, shaking the earth and turning the plains into scorched wasteland.

As the battle grew increasingly fierce, the examinees' conditions gradually began to shift.

---

As the exam progressed, Su Yanyang's underground tomb complex grew increasingly intricate, its labyrinthine chambers hungrily devouring wave after wave of Yellow Turban Warriors. Endless traps relentlessly slaughtered the invading forces.

But then, noticing the constant notifications flashing in his Bionic Eye, Su Yanyang finally couldn't resist checking them.

Especially after recalling the earlier notification about the Jade Nectar Coin's price increase.

"What if the Jade Nectar Coin has gone up again?"

Ever since purchasing the Jade Nectar Coin, Su Yanyang had developed a habit of checking its price, refreshing related news, and scouring gossip groups at every opportunity.

Sometimes, he would simply stare at the coin's price, trading volume, and other data fluctuations for hours, even when he had nothing else to do.

Now, as he opened the notifications, Su Yanyang's heart skipped a beat.

"Jade Liquid Divine Monarch Publicly Announces Dao Companion."

"Jade Liquid Divine Monarch to Marry."

"Rumor: After the wedding, Jade Liquid Divine Monarch will no longer engage in Dual Cultivation with anyone but her Dao Companion!"

Reading these rapidly circulating news items, Su Yanyang's mind reeled. His magic power faltered for a moment, allowing the Yellow Turban Warriors to breach a section of his underground tomb.

Even so, Su Yanyang could only put up a token resistance before focusing his attention back on the Jade Nectar Coins.

He realized a crucial truth: "If the Jade Liquid Divine Monarch no longer engages in Dual Cultivation with outsiders, wouldn't she be even less likely to offer Dual Cultivation through lotteries?"

"The Jade Nectar Coins are about to plummet."

"They're going to crash."

With this thought, Su Yanyang frantically logged into the platform and began selling his Jade Nectar Coins.

"Damn it! Why did the Jade Liquid Divine Monarch stop offering Dual Cultivation after her wedding?"

"What era is this? Why cling to ancient customs?"

"Is she even a Divine Monarch who has transcended the mundane?"

"And who is her Dao Companion? Are they just going to watch her destroy her own legacy? Why aren't they urging her to continue Dual Cultivation with outsiders?"

As he imagined the impending collapse of the Jade Nectar Coins, Su Yanyang cursed the Jade Liquid Divine Monarch inwardly, deeming her too antiquated, too backward, and utterly lacking in ambition.

"No more Dual Cultivation after finding a Dao Companion? Abandoning the Jade Nectar Coins she's cultivated for so long? Isn't that undermining her very foundation on the Immortal Dao? The Jade Liquid Divine Monarch has no self-respect at all."

Because Xiao Yunji had focused most of her mental energy on this task, she suffered repeated setbacks in the examination hall. In the blink of an eye, several more sections of the underground tomb had been breached!

---

Meanwhile, in Xiao Yunji's examination arena:

Her figure continued to flicker at blinding speed. Her three-headed, six-armed form stood like an unyielding fortress, crushing every Yellow Turban Warrior that dared approach into dust.

A dense mountain of wreckage piled up at her feet, encircling the formation core like a ring of garbage heaps.

With a hiss, another vial of medicinal fluid was injected into Xiao Yunji's neck, stabilizing her rapidly declining Dharma Bionic synchronization rate.

But Xiao Yunji paid no heed. Her eyes held only battle. Methodically, she repeated her techniques, each strike delivered with maximum speed, ferocity, and power, slaughtering the Yellow Turban Warriors before her one by one.

As for Jade Nectar Coins? She had long since stopped caring.

From the moment the examination began, she had shut down all social media, determined to focus entirely on unleashing her full combat prowess and demonstrating her true strength in the arena.

---

Meanwhile, the judges and guests aboard the Flying Boat had also noticed the unusual activity in the examination hall.

"Has some news about the Jade Nectar Coin leaked out?" True Monarch Cloud Haven spoke, his humanoid cloud of mist crackling with lightning and muffled thunder. "This will certainly test the students' mental fortitude!"

True Monarch Celestial Elephant, standing beside him, dismissed the matter with a wave of his hand. "What's so special about this?"

"Back when Immortal Dao technology was less advanced, we've had exams interrupted by network outages, earthquakes, and spiritual energy surges. This is nothing new!"

"How can one climb the path of the Immortal Dao without an indomitable Dao Heart?"

In True Monarch Celestial Elephant's view, currency fluctuations were as natural as the shifting of stars or the surging of spiritual energy — merely environmental changes. If students couldn't withstand such minor disruptions, what business did they have pursuing a Military Certificate?

True Monarch Cloud Haven nodded, his voice tinged with melancholy. "As Immortal Dao technology advances, students' mental fortitude has deteriorated."

"In our day, we'd be fighting on the front lines while our companies back home declared bankruptcy. This little incident is nothing compared to that."

True Monarch Celestial Elephant shook his head, observing Su Yanyang's flustered state. "That's not how you trade cryptocurrencies. If he'd traded like that back in the day, he would have been wiped out long ago!"

Then, True Monarch Celestial Elephant turned his gaze to Ping Han, his eyes flickering with interest. "Oh?"

---

"Don't panic! It's all fake news!" Ping Han declared calmly.

"The price fluctuations are just technical adjustments. Everyone, stay calm!"

As the messages flooded the paid group chat, Ping Han maintained his composure. With a swift change of hand seals, he channeled the combined power of the Minor Threefold Combination and the Grand Formation to continue the battle.

His Magic Power and Gang Qi flowed with machine-like precision, showing no trace of panic. Not only did he maintain his composure, but he also continued to unleash devastating attacks on the battlefield while reassuring the group members.

Boom!

With a thunderous palm strike, Ping Han shattered the rocky terrain. The earth roared like an enraged dragon as the Yellow Turban Warrior disintegrated into countless fragments, raining down upon the ground.

Despite Ping Han's unwavering composure, his Soul Cultivators grew increasingly anxious, causing temporary disarray in the battle lines.

Faced with this situation, Ping Han immediately shared a screenshot.

Ping Chao: This is the Jade Nectar Coin I just bought!

Ping Han: Trust me, with my two years of crypto trading experience, this is all fake news. The price fluctuations are just normal!

Ping Han: Hold steady! Don't panic!

Feeling Ping Han's unwavering composure and seeing the orders he posted, the previously panicked Soul Cultivators gradually regained their composure.

But only Ping Han knew that his back was already drenched in cold sweat.

His extensive trading experience had taught him that in times like these, panic was the greatest enemy. He had to hold on!

And he genuinely believed his judgment was sound.

"The Jade Nectar Coin will definitely continue to rise!"

"All I need to do is endure."

At that moment, the surging tide of Yellow Turban Warriors before Ping Han seemed to transform into the fluctuating charts of coin prices.

He would hack through this wilderness, maintaining a steadfast Dao Heart amidst the volatile market, unyielding and sworn never to surrender!

Boom!

Ping Han unleashed another palm strike, sending a swarm of Yellow Turban Warriors flying.

14.99
14.98
14.99
14.97

As Ping Han relentlessly repelled the endless onslaught of Yellow Turban Warriors, the fluctuations in the Jade Nectar Coin continued, stirring the minds of countless Soul Cultivators into turmoil.

Ping Han, however, remained like a silent machine, continuously circulating his cultivation energy and striking out with his palms.

He stood like an unyielding, rugged reef at the forefront of the raging tide, shattering wave after wave of howling, roaring fury.

Just as the Yellow Turban Warriors' attacks grew fiercer and the Soul Cultivators' anxiety reached its peak, unable to maintain Ping Han's composure, the Jade Liquid Divine Monarch finally made her announcement!

In another examination hall, Su Yanyang excitedly clicked on the notification, thinking, "Is this the announcement that the grand wedding has been canceled?"

He quickly realized it wasn't.

The Jade Liquid Divine Monarch declared that no matter how many grand weddings she held in the future, she would never abandon her career, cease external Dual Cultivation, or discontinue the lottery-based Dual Cultivation events. She would forever dedicate herself to the Dual Cultivation endeavors she cherished!

She also announced that the first lottery ceremony would begin next week, with 1,000 slots available!
