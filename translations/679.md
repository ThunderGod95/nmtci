# Chapter 679: Responding to Trust, Reclaiming the Sun

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's gaze swept across the streams of information flowing through the Spirit Realm.

With a thought, the phantom image of the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda materialized within the Spirit Realm. With a thunderous roar, it suppressed the information streams, sealing off all rumors about the war's progress.

Yet Magnetic Pole knew this suppression was only temporary.

As time passed, news of the deteriorating war situation would inevitably spread throughout University City. More and more Myriad Laws Masters and Students would come to understand the dire circumstances.

In her mind's eye, Magnetic Pole could already envision the scene: stock prices, bonds, currency values... all collapsing one after another as the war effort faltered.

Panic would grip the market and the university, causing a stampede for the exits that would only worsen the situation. As conditions deteriorated further, more and more people would flee University City, some even joining the Righteous Qi Alliance.

This was one of the reasons Divine Monarch Greenwood had urged Zhang Yu to evacuate early. The avalanche's momentum... might accelerate far faster than anyone imagined.

As she pondered, reports materialized before Magnetic Pole's eyes.

"Another test?" she thought to herself.

Ever since their defeat in the Lunar War, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had been receiving a constant stream of proposals from Nascent Soul True Monarchs within the university. These proposals, whether overt or subtle, all aimed to weaken her and her subordinates' resource supply, diminish her authority, and erode her wealth.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole understood that these Nascent Soul True Monarchs were backed by Divine Monarch Tranquility and Divine Monarch Cloud Haven, who were constantly probing her defenses.

She understood their motives perfectly.

In Kunxu, victory brought boundless adoration, elevating one to celestial heights with surging popularity, company investments, and even dogs vying for a piece of the action.

Defeat, however, invited a deluge of scorn, with everyone eager to take a bite out of you, even cats hissing at your approach.

"Defeat comes at a price," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole mused. "Tranquility, Cloud Haven... It's not that I'm unwilling to pay the price. It's just... even if I relinquish my position... can you two truly bear the weight?"

"At this moment, can you shoulder the burden of Myriad Laws University?"

Beyond internal dissent, the Heavenly Demon, Netherworld, and other Ten Great Universities had also begun questioning Magnetic Pole's leadership.

Magnetic Pole thought with resentment, "The Heavenly Demons have the gall to demand compensation for their losses in this war?"

"Netherworld... still scheming to seize Myriad Laws University's assets even at a time like this..."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole snorted coldly. "Damn it... when Old Gao and I made a slight retreat, you two were the first to flee."

The thought of the looming crisis and the intensifying internal strife among the Ten Great Universities, exacerbated by dwindling resources, gave Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole a headache.

She then glanced at her repeatedly rejected proposal.

To counter the rapid expansion of the Dark Spirit Realm and the Righteous Qi Alliance, enlightened figures within the Ten Great Universities, including Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, had proposed plans such as a joint training program for all ten universities, a unified certification system, and the sharing of military-grade cultivation techniques, magical artifacts, and Bionics among the institutions.

In truth, similar regulations had existed among the Ten Great Universities many years ago, but they had long been abandoned, suppressed by vested interests, until Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole recently unearthed them.

"I had hoped to leverage our victory in the Lunar War to smoothly advance this plan," she thought bitterly. "Now it seems there's no chance..."

Meanwhile, observing the sky, one could see the Rebel Army from the Third Layer advancing relentlessly, their triumphant songs echoing through the air. It seemed only a matter of time before they completely occupied the entire Third Layer.

Magnetic Pole understood that the enemy would soon consolidate the vast resources of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Layers to launch a full-scale assault on the Second Layer.

The thought of the ever-increasing internal and external pressures made Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sigh deeply once more.

"If we're to hold out any longer, we'll have no choice but to turn the entire Second Layer into a battlefield and wage a limitless guerrilla war."

As this strategy formed in her mind, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's gaze sharpened slightly, as if recalling past historical events. She envisioned the Second Layer engulfed in raging flames, reduced to ashes.

Just then, she sensed Divine Monarch Greenwood's projection materializing beside her.

Magnetic Pole said calmly, "Old Gao, shouldn't you be resting and recovering from your injuries? What are you doing out here again?"

She sighed. "Don't worry about the Lunar War. Anyone could have taken your place. Besides, none of them know the Lunar Immortal Array as well as you do."

"And in a two-on-one fight, Chain Nexus would inevitably focus his relentless attacks on one of us."

"Others don't share our trust and wouldn't last until the end. After Chain Nexus focuses his attention on them, even minor injuries would likely send them fleeing, leading to an even more crushing defeat."

"Ultimately..." Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed, "it all comes down to us being too poor."

"Chain Nexus has the resources of the Finance Department at his disposal, plus the spoils from raiding the fifth and fourth layers of the Spirit Realm to fuel his cultivation. He's backed by the Qi Luck of countless Dark Spirit Realm inhabitants and faces no restrictions."

"He's richer than us, commands more resources, and thus his combat power is advancing far faster. This gives him more options..."

Just as Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole was speaking, Greenwood interrupted, his voice barely concealing his excitement: "Magnetic Pole, I've found a solution."

Magnetic Pole looked at Greenwood, puzzled. "A solution?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood explained, "Over the past eight months, Zhang Yu has been studying Kunlun in the Palm and has discovered a way to break through the spatial blockade."

Magnetic Pole's first reaction was instinctive disbelief, but then she seemed to recall something and nodded thoughtfully. "Have him come to my laboratory."

---

Inside the laboratory, Zhang Yu clasped his palms together. A visible ripple emanated from his hands, spreading outward in all directions.

The air within a radius of several dozen meters began to churn violently, coalescing into a rapidly rotating vortex that converged relentlessly toward the center of Zhang Yu's palms.

Simultaneously, as the massive vortex formed, a spatial gateway — opened by the Immortal Descendant — slowly materialized within the space between Zhang Yu's clasped hands.

Using "Kunlun in the Palm" to shrink and absorb everything around him, he then channeled the Immortal Descendant's spatial power to contain it all within the newly opened gateway.

The surrounding air currents, spiritual energy, Magic Power... even light itself were continuously devoured.

His clasped hands had transformed into a void, like a black hole, exerting an overwhelming gravitational pull that frantically consumed everything within its reach.

As Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole observed, though she couldn't see the spatial gateway opened by the Immortal Descendant within Zhang Yu's palms, her Bionic Eye continuously displayed fluctuating Spatial Coefficient values.

Despite her still rudimentary understanding of Spatial Technology, she could sense the intensity of these fluctuations and their profound impact on the fabric of space itself.

"A significant opportunity..."

"The spatial structure seems to have been completely shattered and then reconstructed."

"If this phenomenon were applied to the spatial blockade deployed by the Chain Nexus..."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole seemed to already visualize the process of spaces colliding and reforming.

Her eyes lit up as she watched the scene. "With this power, we might be able to break through the Chain Nexus's spatial blockade."

"Stop, Zhang Yu," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said, her gaze fixed intently on her student. "Tell me, how did you generate this power?"

Zhang Yu explained, "Since my battle with Dao Qiankun, I've been repeatedly reviewing the entire process, watching recordings of the fight..."

Just as he had explained to Divine Monarch Greenwood earlier, Zhang Yu didn't directly mention the existence of the Immortal Descendant. Instead, he attributed everything to Kunlun in the Palm, inspiration from Dao Qiankun, and his own insights.

After all, the Immortal Descendant's origins were impossible to explain, and its existence was tied to the authority of the Kunxu Immortals. The more people who knew about it, the greater the danger — even for those who possessed the knowledge.

Fortunately, the Immortal Descendant possessed inherent concealment properties, and the activation of Kunlun in the Palm further masked its spatial effects. Zhang Yu simply omitted any mention of the Immortal Descendant, instead attributing everything to "Kunlun in the Palm" as a cover.

Zhang Yu continued, "I've been driving this power derived from Kunlun in the Palm purely through intuition and comprehension. I haven't yet been able to summarize the underlying principles of its spatial technology using rational, objective language and data..."

Divine Monarch Greenwood nodded in agreement, finding nothing problematic in Zhang Yu's explanation.

After all, martial arts operated on different levels. The first level involved executing techniques through one's own intuition and skill, driven by instinct. The second level required summarizing the underlying principles behind the martial arts phenomena.

The difference between these two levels was as vast as heaven and earth.

Divine Monarch Greenwood had cultivated countless martial arts throughout his life and witnessed countless practitioners. While many cultivators could execute techniques, very few could articulate the underlying principles.

Even rarer were those who could apply these principles to other domains, creating new cultivation arts or even practical applications.

Zhang Yu elaborated, "I've been trying to quantify the spatial power involved, but I haven't yet been able to determine the exact Spatial Coefficient. I'm still working on refining the calculations..."

Divine Monarch Greenwood nodded again, understanding the difficulty of quantifying such complex phenomena.

Zhang Yu continued, "I've also been experimenting with different activation methods for Kunlun in the Palm. By adjusting the energy flow and resonance patterns, I've been able to manipulate the spatial power with greater precision..."

Divine Monarch Greenwood nodded once more, impressed by Zhang Yu's progress.

Zhang Yu concluded, "Ultimately, my goal is to develop a military-grade cultivation technique based on these principles. I believe this Spatial Coefficient will be crucial for creating such a technique..."

Divine Monarch Greenwood nodded a final time, his eyes gleaming with anticipation.

Zhang Yu's ability to advance Kunlun in the Palm to such a degree within just eight months had already marked him as a true prodigy in Divine Monarch Greenwood's eyes, rekindling his memories of Dao Qiankun from years past.

Divine Monarch Greenwood mused inwardly, "After Dao Qiankun gained the memories of an Immortal, he could be considered one of the Immortal's many reincarnations."

"Yet even such a Dao Qiankun showed exceptional favor toward Zhang Yu."

Observing Zhang Yu's current performance, Divine Monarch Greenwood couldn't help but wonder, "Could Zhang Yu also be...?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole thought to herself, "An Immortal reincarnation? It's highly probable.

"After all, Dao Qiankun held Zhang Yu in such high regard. Their past lives must have been connected."

Recalling Zhang Yu's personality, his loyalty to old friends, and his meteoric rise in power, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's suspicions deepened.

"But if he's an Immortal reincarnation, why is Zhang Yu so poor? And some aspects of his progress don't seem to align with someone possessing Immortal memories."

Remembering Zhang Yu's performance during the Yin Artifact Experiment, she thought, "Perhaps Zhang Yu's Immortal memories haven't fully awakened yet? Perhaps each awakening triggers a sudden leap forward in certain areas."

At that moment, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole felt an overwhelming urge to seize Zhang Yu and drag him into her laboratory. She longed to use the Yin Artifact Bionic he had created to thoroughly transfer Zhang Yu's memories and unravel the secrets hidden within him.

However, after a moment's reflection, she suppressed this tempting impulse.

"Though I still believe my choices during the Lunar War were justified, the process of making those decisions was indeed influenced by many... many emotions that are now abandoned and scorned by the powerful."

"If these thoughts were revealed to the public, my authority would be severely undermined. Countless cultivators would lose faith in me and grow anxious about the future of Myriad Laws."

"Yet perhaps... it was precisely because of this choice that Zhang Yu truly trusted me and Greenwood, leading him to make today's decision and granting me the opportunity to finally defeat Chain Nexus."

Magnetic Pole understood that the secrets Zhang Yu had revealed held immense value, while Zhang Yu's own strength remained at the Golden Core Realm.

"Zhang Yu's decision today couldn't have been driven solely by rationality, self-interest, or calculations of gain and loss. It required a transcendent emotion — trust — to propel him forward."

"How, then, should I repay this trust?"

---

Magnetic Pole glanced at Divine Monarch Greenwood beside her, then turned to Zhang Yu and said slowly, "My dear disciple, given the current situation... Since you can't yet summarize the underlying principles of the technology, that means... we have only two options to break through the spatial blockade."

"First, you could personally join the battle."

"Second, we could continue to wait for your growth, waiting for you to summarize the technological principles and convert them into combat power for our side."

At this point, Magnetic Pole's gaze grew solemn. "However... the current situation may not afford you that much time to develop."

"We must turn the tide immediately to salvage the situation, restore the various academies' confidence in the war, and thus buy you more time to grow."

"But participating in a Soul Transformation battle... the dangers involved need no further explanation."

"The decision of whether to participate rests entirely with you."

Zhang Yu took a deep breath, a spark of fighting spirit suddenly igniting in his eyes. "Master, I've already considered this thoroughly before coming here. If I continue to hide for self-preservation, I might remain safe for a while longer, but in the end, it would only be a futile struggle against death."

"Having inherited an Immortal Sect Technique and being the strongest undergraduate among the Ten Great Universities, I naturally bear the corresponding responsibility. I must exert my influence on the world's changes."

"I want to participate in this battle."

Zhang Yu also understood that while this battle carried great risks, the potential rewards were equally immense.

He thought to himself, "Besides securing a better cultivation environment after turning the tide... if I can slay Divine Monarch Chain Nexus, there's a chance the Supreme Clarity Realm might drop his Immortal Sect Technique. And if I can find an opportunity to devour the Evil God guarding Chain Nexus..."

Seeing Zhang Yu's resolute gaze, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole thought inwardly, "My disciple has grown so much without me even realizing it."

A moment later, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled. "Very well. Since you're so determined, let's risk everything together, master and disciple."

"But during the battle... you must stay safely behind me."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole patted Zhang Yu's head, smiling. "After all, your Golden Core is still too young and unstable to hold its own."

"So I, your teacher, will claim all the glory and prestige of this battle."

"You just hide well, secretly lend me a hand, and let me take all the credit."

Zhang Yu was momentarily stunned before realizing what was happening. He looked at Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and said, "Teacher, you..."

"What? Not satisfied?" Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole retorted. "I've already decided. This battle will be led by me."

"The world will never know of your contributions, Zhang Yu. All the glory for breaking through the spatial blockade, demonstrating spatial power, and defeating Chain Nexus — every gaze from friend and foe alike — will be focused solely on me."

"As for you, after this battle, take the rewards I give you and go into seclusion. Remain in seclusion until you reach the Nascent Soul stage."

Hearing Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's words, Zhang Yu felt no resentment. He understood her reasoning.

"If I were to reveal my ability to break through the spatial blockade, I would immediately become a target, the focal point for both sides," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "So Teacher Magnetic Pole... she's decided to take my place, bearing all the pressure for me until I'm strong enough. She'll shield me from the Ten Great Universities' demands for spatial technology, and protect me from the Righteous Qi Alliance's harassment, assassinations, probing, and schemes..."

Divine Monarch Greenwood, sensing Zhang Yu's potential misunderstanding, interjected, "Zhang Yu, since you are our student, it's only natural that we shield you from the storm."

"The technology to break through spatial blockades... it's too important, too burdensome. For now, let Magnetic Pole handle it for you."

"Once you've grown stronger, we'll return everything to you."

Zhang Yu nodded. "I understand, Teacher... I understand."

"Right now, I'm too weak, so I'm hiding behind you."

"But I'll work hard to grow, to cultivate diligently. One day... I hope I can stand before you and protect you."

"This venerable one is a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch. What need do I have for your protection?" Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole waved her sleeve dismissively. "Enough talk. The situation is critical. Let's discuss the battle plan now."

Zhang Yu asked, "Do we need to deploy immediately?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "Naturally. Every second we delay costs countless lives."

Zhang Yu pressed, "How soon is 'immediately'?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole stated, "In half an hour."

"We two masters will reclaim the Sun."

Divine Monarch Greenwood said, "Then I'll prepare as well."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole retorted, "Prepare what? Has your last serious injury fully healed? Going would only burden Zhang Yu and me."

Divine Monarch Greenwood seemed to choke back his anger. "I..."

"What about you? Stay home and wait for Zhang Yu and me to return," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole declared, waving her long sleeves with domineering authority. "If we can break through the spatial blockade, the two of us will be enough."

Half an hour later.

A radiant rainbow shot skyward as Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole transformed into a fiery streak, soaring out of Myriad Laws University's University City. Observed by countless Soul Transformation cultivators, she hurtled directly toward the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness.

Simultaneously, as Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole accelerated to hypersonic speeds, Zhang Yu remained concealed within her Heavenly Sun Radiance God, activating his temporary Magic Power limit, "Boundless Magic Power."

Zhang Yu understood that while his "Kunlun in the Palm" combined with "Immortal Descendant" was immensely powerful, it wasn't without flaws.

The exorbitant Magic Power consumption was a significant constraint.

Especially as the Kunlun in the Palm's range expanded and the number of captured entities increased, the Magic Power drain became terrifying.

If he were to face a Soul Transformation cultivator alone, he'd likely exhaust his Magic Power within a few exchanges.

Fortunately, this battle wasn't his alone. Moreover, Zhang Yu's Magic Power limit had surged dramatically in recent days. Now, with the temporary limit activated, his meridians, Dantian, and Golden Core suddenly felt ravenous, frantically absorbing spiritual energy and continuously expanding his Magic Power reserves.

At that moment, Zhang Yu's Magic Power limit abruptly surpassed 16,000 units.

Simultaneously, the second layer effect of Boundless Magic Power continued to activate, frantically stirring the spiritual energy as Zhang Yu moved at high speed, further accelerating his Magic Power recovery rate.

Sensing the commotion emanating from Zhang Yu, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded inwardly. "Another Immortal memory must have awakened."

"Very well," she thought. "Today, my disciple and I will raise hell together."

---

Amidst the clouds, Divine Monarch Cloud Haven's incarnation observed the scene from afar. "Has Magnetic Pole truly achieved a breakthrough?"

Beside him, Divine Monarch Tranquility's incarnation replied, "Could she have made such progress in such a short time? My concern is that Magnetic Pole can't accept defeat, which is why she hastily launched this second battle."

In Divine Monarch Tranquility's eyes, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole resembled a gambler blinded by losses, unable to accept her previous defeat and thus initiating this second conflict.

Divine Monarch Cloud Haven sighed. "If she loses this battle as well..."

True Monarch Tranquility echoed the sigh, leaving the sentence unfinished.

Meanwhile, the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs from other universities had all received Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's notification and were flooding her with messages.

Heavenly Demon University's Soul Transformation Divine Monarch: "Have you gone mad, Magnetic Pole? Stop this immediately!"

Netherworld University's Soul Transformation Divine Monarch: "Magnetic Pole, don't rashly start another war. We can't afford a second defeat."

Celestial Monsters University: "Magnetic Pole, if you want to die, go alone! We won't send a single soldier to support you!"

---

On top of the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness.

Ever since the Lunar War victory and the Moon's fall, True Monarch Chain Nexus had seized control of the Sun, establishing his permanent command post there to oversee the entirety of the Second Layer Earth.

At that moment, his tightly closed eyes slowly opened, his consciousness withdrawing from the Dark Spirit Realm.

"Magnetic Pole?"

He gazed at the towering pillar of fire and said calmly, "Have you come to meet your end again?"

Auspicious God's laughter echoed from the Dark Spirit Realm. "Capture her, and the Second Layer will be secured. We can then smoothly execute the next phase of our plan."

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus slowly rose to his feet. The Dark Spirit Realm's live broadcast layers activated one by one, instantly allowing countless viewers to witness the impending battle.

"Another fight?"

"Who's the opponent?"

"Just Magnetic Pole alone? Has she gone mad?"

Faced with Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's taunt, Magnetic Pole offered no response, no acknowledgment. Instead, she charged toward the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness with relentless speed! Charge! Charge! Charge!

For Magnetic Pole understood that this battle was different from their previous encounter.

Now that she had a chance to break through the spatial blockade, she needed to fight with utmost speed, aiming to secure victory before the Soul Transformation Divine Monarch could react.

With a deafening roar, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, engulfed in raging flames, slammed against the outer layers of the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness, only to be repelled by the layered spatial barriers.

Watching this unfold, Divine Monarch Chain Nexus sneered, "Magnetic Pole, your combat instincts were already lacking. Now your mind has failed you too?"

The outer perimeter of the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness was now sealed by layers upon layers of spatial barriers, transferred by Divine Monarch Chain Nexus from the shattered Moon.

These barriers formed an invisible, impenetrable wall, isolating everything within from the outside world.

A single, narrow opening remained, allowing the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness to continue emitting light, heat, and Spirit Realm communications across the Second Layer, while restricting entry to forces no greater than two Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs.

As the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, controlled by Magnetic Pole, repeatedly crashed against the spatial barriers like a maddened beast, Divine Monarch Chain Nexus remarked with leisurely amusement, "Let's see how long you can keep up this charade..."

*Boom!*

Amidst the violent collision, within the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's blinding light and scorching heat, a fiery drill materialized in Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's palm.

This was a magical artifact Magnetic Pole had specifically acquired to conceal Zhang Yu's presence. Under her protection, Zhang Yu now hid within the drill.

"Chain Nexus..." Magnetic Pole's voice was cold and detached. "I may have lost our last battle, but I've gained a deeper understanding of spatial mysteries. This has allowed me to refine my power further and forge this World-Piercing Cone."

"Today, you'll see how I shatter your turtle shell."

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus watched this scene with a scornful smile. "Do you think you can easily unravel the magic of an Immortal? Magnetic Pole, you must be delirious from your defeat..."

But the next moment, as the fiery drill bit slammed violently against the spatial barrier, Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's heart skipped a beat, and a flicker of anxiety crossed his face.

Yet when he saw the spatial barrier remained completely intact, he breathed a sigh of relief. "I was overthinking it after all. How could Magnetic Pole possibly breach an Immortal's technology?"

A smug smile spread across Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's face. He decided to broadcast Magnetic Pole's descent into madness, showing her repeated failures as the spatial barrier utterly blocked her every attempt.

"No need for a real battle," he thought. "Simply showing this spectacle will reassure the masses."

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole stared intently at the point of impact between the drill bit and the spatial barrier, her heart pounding. "Can it work?"

She knew she had staked everything on this moment.

If this battle failed, not only would her personal prestige, reputation, and assets plummet from their lofty heights, but the entire war situation would also take a sharp turn for the worse.

Meanwhile, surrounded by extreme heat and light, concealed within the drill under the layers of Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's protective aura, Zhang Yu clasped his hands together, activating Kunlun in the Palm and Immortal Descendant.

This time, his activation range was extremely narrow, focused on a tiny point at the drill's tip.

As the light and heat were continuously devoured by Kunlun in the Palm and channeled into the space opened by Immortal Descendant, a layer of darkness gradually emerged at the drill's tip.

This darkness violently pierced the spatial barrier, causing it to tremble under Kunlun in the Palm's relentless assault.

Zhang Yu intended to use Kunlun in the Palm to pull the spatial barrier closer, then disintegrate it with Immortal Descendant.

But he quickly realized this approach wouldn't work.

"No... Kunlun in the Palm at level 30 can't shake the spatial barrier set up by Divine Monarch Chain Nexus."

"I need to get closer myself..."

Straining forward, Zhang Yu extended his pitch-black palms, thrusting them fiercely toward the spatial barrier.

At that moment, he felt as if he were forcibly driving his hands into an impossibly solid substance, each inch of penetration sending violent tremors through his body.

Even with Zhang Yu's physical resilience, the shock caused blood to seep from his seven orifices, his entire body erupting in crimson mist.

Yet the effect was astonishing. Zhang Yu sensed that the spatial gateway opened by the Immortal Descendant had collided with the barrier before him, leaving the Immortal Descendant's side unscathed while the barrier opposite began to crumble.

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus, who had stood as steady as Mount Tai moments before, suddenly paled. His expression shifted rapidly from confusion to astonishment, then disbelief, and finally, a mixture of shock and fury.

"Impossible!"

Boom!

As if in response to the Divine Monarch's enraged roar, a massive hole tore through the spatial barrier as the fiery drill advanced. The once-impenetrable spatial blockade encircling the Sun, as stable as a carefully constructed stack of blocks, collapsed into fragments the moment a single piece was removed.

In the next instant, the Soul Transformation cultivators from the Ten Great Universities, who had been observing the battle, acted in unison, transforming into streams of divine light that completely enveloped the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness.

As Divine Monarch Chain Nexus soared upward, attempting to retreat, hand after hand pressed down on him, forcing him back onto the Sun.

Simultaneously, thunderous roars erupted from all directions.

"Well done, Magnetic Pole! I knew you could do it!"

"Haha, all our preparations for this battle were worth it. The tables have finally turned!"

"Magnetic Pole, quickly seize the Sun..."

Under Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's gaze, Magnetic Pole held the World-Piercing Cone in one hand and grasped the Sun with the other. She stood surrounded by numerous Divine Monarchs from the Ten Great Universities, their cold eyes fixed upon her.
