# Chapter 600: Kuang Tianqing! I'm going to kill you!

While quickly reviewing the design blueprints, Zhang Yu grasped the potential mechanism behind the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body.

"According to the blueprints, the updated Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body no longer affects the body through the air. Instead, it manipulates spiritual energy."

"Cultivators constantly circulate spiritual energy through the breathing technique, refining it into Magic Power, which then flows throughout their bodies."

"The Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body contaminates this spiritual energy, causing the tainted energy to flood the opponent's body. Carried by the Magic Power, it spreads throughout their system, distorting their senses and deceiving their mind."

Having deduced this, Zhang Yu instructed Bai Zhenzhen to cease their breathing technique, relying solely on their internal Magic Power for movement.

The moment he made direct contact with Kuang Tianqing, Zhang Yu realized his theory was correct.

"Got you!"

As his hypothesis was confirmed, Zhang Yu immediately recognized another critical implication.

"Even if we've countered the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body, without the breathing technique, we can't replenish our Magic Power."

"Can we use the Relics in the sword casket to replenish our Magic Power?"

"But Kuang Tianqing can easily block it."

"In other words, against Kuang Tianqing wielding the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body, A-Zhen and I have a limited window for effective combat."

"We must severely injure her before our magic power is depleted!"

The moment Zhang Yu identified Kuang Tianqing's true form, the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power within him erupted. The Heavenly Sun Radiance God descended in a blaze of fire, and his 24 flying swords trembled in unison, unleashing their Sword Realm to strike downward.

Even beneath Kuang Tianqing's feet, chains surged from the earth, temporarily transforming into magical artifacts to bind her, activated by the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon.

As he executed this series of actions, Zhang Yu turned to Bai Zhenzhen.

"A-Zhen, if it were you, you should be able to coordinate with my movements..."

Bai Zhenzhen stepped forward, her eyes burning with intense Sword Intent.

"I understand, Yu Zi."

"We must severely injure her before our magic power runs out."

"You focus on restraining her completely. I'll handle the rest..."

Bai Zhenzhen formed a Dao Seal with her hand, summoning her flying sword for the first time since the battle began.

The sky crackled with thunder and lightning as two flying swords streaked toward the battlefield.

Throughout Bai Zhenzhen's movements and combat, her flying swords had remained poised high above, awaiting her command to strike at a critical moment.

As the two swords closed in, Bai Zhenzhen frowned slightly. "Only two?"

She had intended to summon all three of her military-grade flying swords.

The missing third sword was the one she had selected from Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' sword vault.

However, since acquiring it, Bai Zhenzhen had struggled to master the sword, often finding it unresponsive to her commands.

"Two will suffice..."

With a fierce cry, Bai Zhenzhen channeled the power of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao and the Seven Emotions Sword Dao into the two swords. Each blade unleashed a heaven-shattering sword qi as they slashed toward Kuang Tianqing.

In a thunderous clash, the Body-Protecting Qi around Kuang Tianqing shattered instantly. The skin on her fingers cracked, and her entire arm seemed on the verge of collapsing under the combined assault of the two military-grade flying swords.

Watching this scene, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen were both overjoyed, redoubling their efforts as they mentally roared, "Fall! Just fall!"

But at that moment, Kuang Tianqing let out a cold laugh. "Not bad, sword qi."

"Your resistance is finally showing some teeth."

"This is making me even more! Even more excited!"

As she spoke, Kuang Tianqing's right arm suddenly transformed, as if instantly turning into a black hole, completely devouring the incoming sword qi, flames, and Earthly Fiend Gravity.

Zhang Yu's heart jolted. "A military-grade Bionic from Netherworld University, combined with their military-grade cultivation technique — the Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art!"

Empowered by the military-grade Bionic, the Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art instantly absorbed all the attacks directed at Kuang Tianqing.

Zhang Yu knew this absorption couldn't be limitless, but in that single moment, it was enough for Kuang Tianqing to break free from all entanglements and teleport hundreds of meters away.

In the next instant, with a casual wave of her hand, the sword qi, flames, shockwaves, Earthly Fiend Gravity, and other attacks she had just swallowed erupted forth, counterattacking Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's position.

In an instant, the two seemed to be swallowed by their own attacks.

Watching this scene, Kuang Tianqing spread her arms wide, laughing wildly as she strode toward them. "You must be wondering how I, from Heavenly Demon University, could have mastered a military-grade cultivation technique from Netherworld University, right?"

"It's simple, very simple."

"During my tutelage under the Eight Great Divine Monarchs, I mastered one military-grade cultivation technique each from the Heavenly Demon, Netherworld, White Bone, and Joyous Union sects."

After breaking through his own attack, Zhang Yu watched Kuang Tianqing's advancing figure, his heart sinking. "Four military-grade cultivation techniques from the Four Great Colleges?"

"Besides the Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art, what else has she mastered?"

Information about various military-grade cultivation techniques flashed through Zhang Yu's mind, the unknown nature of her abilities intensifying his sense of threat.

Meanwhile, Kuang Tianqing tilted her head and said, "We agreed on three minutes, and one minute has already passed."

"I'll have to speed things up then."

In the blink of an eye, the battle resumed with renewed intensity.

Kuang Tianqing, clad in military-grade magical artifacts, displayed terrifying power. Combined with the formidable Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art, she effortlessly absorbed their attacks, then redirected them back with equal force.

"This guy..." Zhang Yu's heart sank. He could sense her relentlessly pressuring them, forcing them to expend vast amounts of Magic Power in the fight.

Meanwhile, Kuang Tianqing, relying on the Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art, continuously deflected their attacks, conserving her own Magic Power.

Her formidable military-grade Bionic armor provided terrifying defensive capabilities, sometimes even allowing her to withstand Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's attacks unscathed.

"Even if I can hold out longer, A-Zhen probably can't last as long."

"We have to break through her Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art..."

Zhang Yu's mind raced through the art's details: "This is a nearly flawless daoist art. Combined with the enhancements from her military-grade Bionic armor, the only way to break through it..."

"Is to confront her head-on!" Bai Zhenzhen stared intently at Kuang Tianqing, her thoughts hardening: "I need to push the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao to even greater heights. Only by surpassing the Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art's limits can I break through this cultivation art!"

As Bai Zhenzhen pondered her next move, Zhang Yu was thinking along similar lines: "My offensive power can't be significantly increased in the short term."

"But A-Zhen... if we can enhance the power of her Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, we might be able to turn the tide of this battle."

Just then, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen felt their bodies stiffen slightly, and the flow of Magic Power within them gradually slowed.

Kuang Tianqing's hand clamped down on Zhang Yu's body, and she laughed, "It's finally taking effect."

Zhang Yu's mind raced, and he thought with alarm: "Could it be... White Bone University's military-grade cultivation technique, that poison art... the Ten Thousand Bones Wither Marrow Curse?"

"Did she poison us earlier while using the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body?"

"We need to use the breathing technique to circulate spiritual energy and gradually suppress the curse poison..."

But Zhang Yu knew that once they began circulating spiritual energy, they would once again be vulnerable to the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body's influence.

"This Kuang Tianqing... her cultivation arts synergize too perfectly."

"She has an endless arsenal of military-grade cultivation techniques at her disposal."

At that moment, as Zhang Yu gazed at Kuang Tianqing, he felt as if he were simultaneously seeing the figures of academic overachievers from the Heavenly Demon, White Bone, Joyous Union, and Netherworld sects... all converging within her.

Every time he thought he had finally understood his opponent, he would discover yet another layer hidden beneath their trump cards.

At this moment, it wasn't Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen besieging their enemy, but rather Kuang Tianqing unleashing the combined power of the Four Great Colleges to hunt them down.

After relentless combat, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen felt their Magic Power growing increasingly sluggish, while their bodies seemed to be gradually rusting, their movements growing slower and slower.

Zhang Yu realized that continuing this battle would only diminish their chances of victory.

"We have to go all out!"

Zhang Yu suddenly grabbed Kuang Tianqing in a tight embrace, shouting, "A-Zhen, give it everything you've got!"

With multiple military-grade powers erupting at full force, Zhang Yu used all his strength to restrain Kuang Tianqing's body.

Without hesitation, Bai Zhenzhen began condensing sword qi, but her mind kept replaying the scene of her earlier sword qi being completely blocked by her opponent.

"I have to become stronger!"

"I must break through my limits!"

Just then, Kuang Tianqing smiled faintly, turned around, and hugged Zhang Yu back, teasing, "Immortal Scum, are you already impatient?"

As their clothes tore, Kuang Tianqing laughed heartily. "Then let's begin."

"Bai Zhenzhen, are you watching?"

"I'm about to start devouring this Immortal Scum piece by piece!"

Zhang Yu watched everything unfold with a sense of resignation, silently urging, "A-Zhen, break through the limits of your Extreme Emotion Sword Dao... I'll hold out until that moment."

Bai Zhenzhen roared, her eyes bloodshot, "I said! Don't touch him!"

Zhang Yu's expression twisted in horror. "No! Don't let me in!"

Kuang Tianqing paused, slightly taken aback. "This guy... he hasn't even started yet, why is he screaming like that?"

"Hmm?"

Kuang Tianqing turned to see Bai Zhenzhen's sword qi had transformed into a deathly, pitch-black aura.

"Why?" Bai Zhenzhen thought bitterly. "Why did you make me witness this?"

"Why did you force me to watch my best friend be violated by a wall?"

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Zhang Yu!"

"I couldn't protect you!"

Today my heart shatters, today my sword trembles...

With an earth-shattering roar, the black sword qi erupted from Bai Zhenzhen's body like a tidal wave, instantly piercing the heavens and tearing the earth asunder.

Bai Zhenzhen's eyes seemed to be filled with nothing but darkness, devoid of all reason.

"Kuang Tianqing! I'm going to kill you!"

The black sword qi surged into her two military-grade flying swords, imbuing them with a life-annihilating power. The swords slashed wildly, colliding violently with Kuang Tianqing's Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art.
