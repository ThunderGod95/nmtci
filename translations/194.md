# Chapter 194: High School Sacred Body? Qi Refinement Sacred Body!

As he practiced the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, Zhang Yu could feel not only his body growing stronger but also the abdominal pain from moments ago gradually fading.

The "Zen" character on his chest grew progressively darker as it absorbed the drug's toxins.

It was during this process that Zhang Yu began to understand the true value of the High School Sacred Body.

Or rather, he had previously underestimated its effects.

_After activating Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, it nourishes my body, increases my strength, and even gathers the toxins, but…_

Zhang Yu compared the difference before and after circulating the technique. _My ability to metabolize the drug doesn't seem to have improved at all._

The Spring and Autumn Endless Zen didn't improve his drug metabolism?

Zhang Yu could only think of two possible explanations.

One was that the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen was incapable of metabolizing the Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor.

The other possibility was that his drug metabolism had already reached an absolute limit before he even activated the technique—a limit that could not be surpassed.

Since the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen could gather the drug's toxins, the first possibility was invalid.

That left only the second.

The description of the High School Sacred Body flashed through Zhang Yu's mind: 'Drug load, absorption, and metabolism abilities increased to the peak of Qi Refinement.'

The 'peak of the Qi Refinement stage' could be interpreted in many ways. Some mortals considered a third-year high school student's level to be the peak. Others believed it was the level achieved ten years after graduation. Still others argued that only a university graduate who had not yet reached Foundation Establishment was truly at the peak of Qi Refinement.

Zhang Yu had originally assumed 'peak of Qi Refinement' referred to a vague range, something akin to the level of a cultivator many years after high school.

But now it seemed…

_This ‘peak of Qi Refinement’… does it mean my drug load, absorption, and metabolism have been raised to the absolute limit of the Qi Refinement stage? Is that why activating Spring and Autumn Endless Zen has no further effect?_

_Does that mean even in my normal state, without the technique, my metabolism is already at the peak for the Qi Refinement stage?_

_Why didn't I notice this before?_ A thought struck him, and he understood. _The drugs I've taken recently were too few and too weak. Their potency was so low that they were absorbed and metabolized effortlessly, making any difference imperceptible._

_It was the fierce, surging power of the Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor that finally revealed the true worth of the High School Sacred Body._

At that moment, an unshakeable confidence welled up within Zhang Yu. _No matter how powerful Number 23, the young master from the Immortal Capital, may be, he is ultimately just a high school student. As long as his drug metabolism hasn't reached the limit of the Qi Refinement stage…_

_Then victory in this exam is mine!_

In that instant, Zhang Yu scoffed internally. _High School Sacred Body? This should be called the Qi Refinement Sacred Body!_

With this realization, he focused on cultivating the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen. Surging power pulsed from his flesh and blood, continuously tempering his muscles, bones, and organs, which he then nourished with Longevity magic power.

Though his High School Sacred Body alone was sufficient to absorb and metabolize the Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor, Zhang Yu would never pass up a chance to use such a precious drug—free of charge—to temper and strengthen his body.

The righteous gods were slightly stunned as they watched Zhang Yu, who, after taking the drug, was now bursting with vigor, every punch and kick generating a resounding boom.

One of the gods remarked, "This Zhang Yu withstood two pills of Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor at once? That should be impossible based on his academic record."

At the same time, the other righteous gods began reviewing the data streaming from the monitoring patches.

Huang Zichou said, "His current physical metrics far exceed his monthly exam results. The boy was hiding his true strength."

Hiding his strength during the monthly exams? The righteous gods were momentarily taken aback, but understanding quickly dawned in their eyes.

In a place like high school, where grades were everything and scores were king, hiding one's strength seemed unthinkable.

But the righteous gods present were all worldly and wise. They knew that in the first layer of Kunxu, many circumstances could force a student to conceal their abilities.

This was especially true for students from poor backgrounds. Hiding one's strength, deliberately scoring low, and maintaining a low profile to avoid the notice of the wealthy… such things were not uncommon.

As for how they did it, each had their own methods. Some poor students would intentionally injure themselves, others would take drugs with debilitating side effects to reduce their strength, and some cultivated techniques that could mask their power…

But such concealment always came at a great cost.

It either led to injuries that hampered cultivation or wasted immense amounts of time and energy. Furthermore, the lack of results meant forfeiting numerous school benefits and aid.

All of this significantly increased the difficulty of cultivation.

And it was always the poor students, who already lacked the funds for cultivation, who needed to hide their strength.

So, to reach the level of competing for a high school Foundation Establishment certificate under such conditions…

_A poor kid rising so suddenly…_ A thought struck Huang Zichou. _Could this be related to an evil god?_

He meticulously re-examined the student's physique, data, and records. Only after finding no anomalies did he breathe a small sigh of relief.

He then glanced at Deng Bingding, thinking he was being overly cautious. With Lady Deng presiding, it was hardly his place to be the one to uncover a follower of some evil god.

Meanwhile, a righteous god nodded slightly and commented, "This boy's talent for the Immortal Dao is limitless. If he finds a good mentor after reaching the second layer, it's not impossible for him to ascend beyond the fifth layer in the future."

Another god said, "The crucial point is that he's only a second-year student. He can take the Foundation Establishment exam again next year. He already has one foot in the door of the Ten Greats."

"His talent is astonishing."

As it was now October, Zhang Yu had officially become a second-year high school student in September.

While the righteous gods were engrossed in their discussion, Huang Zichou remained silent, lost in his memories.

He had witnessed the rise of five or six such Immortal Dao geniuses of similar caliber, and they all shared one common trait…

_Talent?_

_Talent, my foot!_

Huang Zichou thought scornfully, _Talent is just the baseline. The single most important factor for any poor genius to rise is having someone powerful backing them._

_Rising through talent and hard work alone? Reaching the pinnacle of the Immortal Dao? Only mortals brainwashed by the corporations and the media would believe such nonsense._

Huang Zichou knew this all too well, having been in charge of the education sector for many years.

Every poor genius who managed to rise was either taken in by a powerful figure after revealing their talent, or their talent itself was the result of a powerful figure's arrangement.

Huang Zichou sighed internally. _This isn't the ancient era. How could anyone possibly succeed on talent alone?_

On the other side, Deng Bingding also refrained from joining the discussion, her thoughts turning to the results of the previous investigation into Zhang Pianpian.

_That Zhang Pianpian was favored by some great deity and has already ascended to the second layer._

_For this Zhang Yu to have improved so terrifyingly… it's likely he also has a god behind him._

At this thought, Deng Bingding's first impulse was to help Zhang Yu. Could she perhaps get on good terms with the great deity backing him?

But the memory of what happened after she had looked into Zhang Pianpian's file last time made her quickly dismiss the idea.

_Every action and word of the great ones above carries profound meaning. Perhaps they are using this situation to conceal Zhang Yu, or to temper him. It's best I don't interfere._

_However… maybe I can add him as a friend after the exam._

While the righteous gods discussed Zhang Yu on their internal network, the other candidates were equally astonished by his performance.

Ye Lingxiao's gaze, in particular, sharpened. After seeing Zhang Yu consume two pills of Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor in a row, the fighting spirit in his eyes burned even brighter.

_So this is your true strength?_ he thought.

_You really were holding back in the last round._

_But I will not lose to you._

_I am the Perfect Bloodline, the culmination of the Ye Clan's countless efforts, the future flagship product of the entire company, destined to claim the Foundation Establishment certificate._

Ye Lingxiao knew that only by securing the certificate would his clan arrange for his Foundation Establishment. Only then could he break through to the Foundation Establishment realm before entering university, laying the most solid foundation for his future ascension to the second layer and apprenticeship under a renowned master.

_My path on the Immortal Dao does not end with the Ten Greats…_

Ye Lingxiao picked up a Magic Power Meridian Injection and decisively jabbed it into his arm.

As the serum entered his body, he felt his magic power roar to life, combusting like ignited gasoline.

His heart hammered in his chest, his breathing grew ragged, and his meridians began to twitch under the frenzied assault of magic power.

"Hah!"

With a low shout, Ye Lingxiao once again activated his level-10 Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, using its full power to dissolve the burden of the ferocious drug.

_No problem…_

Empowered by the Perfect Bloodline, Ye Lingxiao's body was like a whale in the ocean, gulping down endless seawater and krill. Every fiber of his flesh, every inch of his organs, madly devoured the drug's potency—digesting, absorbing, and metabolizing it.

With the added boost from the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, he could feel the surging medicinal power being processed by his cultivation, harmlessly accumulating as waste within him. A confident smile played on his lips.

Just as Ye Lingxiao felt the drug's intense effect pass its peak, a thought occurred to him.

_Another shot should be fine._

_I'll take one more to create an insurmountable gap between us and show him true despair…_

But as Ye Lingxiao reached for another Magic Power Meridian Injection, he caught a glimpse of Zhang Yu walking up beside him and picking up an injection of his own.

He heard Zhang Yu mutter, "Just tempering my body is too wasteful. I might as well boost my magic power while I'm at it."

Then, to Ye Lingxiao's utter astonishment, Zhang Yu plunged the needle into his own arm.

As the drug entered his system, Zhang Yu's body gave a slight twitch. His Great Sun Qi Sea then erupted like a volcano, frantically drawing in the surrounding spiritual energy.
