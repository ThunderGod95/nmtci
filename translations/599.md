# Chapter 599: Swallowing Immortal Scum, Internal Testing of Cultivation Art

"Get out of my way!" Zhang Yu roared, his figure already leaping back to his feet after being knocked down.

Surging Gang Qi, mixed with the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill, erupted from his body, transforming into golden flames that enveloped him. The flames instantly shattered the Kuang Tianqing before him, causing her to dissipate into thin air.

Yet in Zhang Yu's eyes, Kuang Tianqing's figure continued to flicker around him, appearing and vanishing in rapid succession.

One moment, his naked eye could still catch a glimpse of her, but the next, she would vanish from sight, only to be detected by his Bionic Eye.

When he struck out with a palm strike, his Gang Qi swept through the air, but her form vanished like a phantom before his eyes.

"Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique..."

As soon as Zhang Yu sensed Kuang Tianqing's presence and realized his perception was being deceived by illusions, information about the Heavenly Demon University's military-grade cultivation technique immediately surfaced in his mind.

"The Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body can distort an opponent's senses, altering their perception of sight, touch, smell, spatial awareness, sense of direction, and other sensory perceptions."

"Kuang Tianqing must be using this military-grade daoist art to deceive my senses."

"Not all these illusions are mere phantoms; her true form must be hidden among them."

"But with our senses distorted, it's impossible to distinguish her. Even if we strike her... we wouldn't feel it or realize it."

"The key to this daoist art lies in the air. If we cut off external air circulation and switch to internal respiration..."

That was Zhang Yu's initial plan, and he immediately put it into action. However, he was quickly shocked to discover that even in internal respiration mode, he couldn't prevent his senses from being continuously distorted.

At that moment, Zhang Yu felt a chill in his lower abdomen, as if a cold hand had gently touched him there.

"See that, Bai Zhenzhen?"

Kuang Tianqing's voice came from behind him, her warm breath brushing his neck as something soft pressed against his back.

"See that, Bai Zhenzhen?"

"I'm going to caress him now."

Zhang Yu roared in fury, his Gang Qi erupting violently as he shattered the illusions again. Yet he couldn't stop them from reforming.

With each appearance, the phantom's hand probed further downward, as if Kuang Tianqing were standing behind Zhang Yu, slowly groping toward his vital points.

"I'm going to rub him! I'm going to start rubbing him!" Kuang Tianqing cackled. "Open your eyes wide and watch carefully, Bai Zhenzhen! Your precious friend is completely under my control!"

Bai Zhenzhen glared at Kuang Tianqing's figure, her eyes, usually as calm as autumn waters, now churned like a stormy sea.

"Zhang Yu... is being forcefully violated!"

If Zhang Yu had willingly chosen to do this, if he had actively charged for such services, Bai Zhenzhen would have had no grounds for complaint.

Even before cultivating the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, Bai Zhenzhen would have supported Zhang Yu earning money through such means — to support their family, advance his cultivation, or simply lend a hand with tasks like guarding doors, collecting fees, or reinforcing formations.

After all, this was the Righteous Path, the orthodox way of Kunxu.

And even after mastering the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, Bai Zhenzhen wouldn't hinder Zhang Yu if he chose to walk the Righteous Path.

She had only wanted to change herself, to forge a new path within the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, hoping that one day she could turn from evil and not hinder Zhang Yu's ability to earn money.

But now...

"No!"

The situation before her was Kuang Tianqing, acting in direct defiance of Zhang Yu's wishes, attempting to forcibly and freely devour him.

Whether considering it from an economic standpoint, personal emotional choice, or the sword qi stirring within her body... everything pointed Bai Zhenzhen to the same answer.

"Let go of him!"

Seeing Kuang Tianqing embrace Zhang Yu from behind, her hand reaching down, Bai Zhenzhen roared in fury. Crimson sword qi erupted from her, slashing swiftly toward Kuang Tianqing's figure.

"Don't you dare touch him with your filthy hands!"

With a whistling roar, the sword qi shattered Kuang Tianqing's form, tearing apart hundreds of meters of earth behind her.

But in the next moment, Kuang Tianqing reappeared, licking her lips with a smile. "Oh? So agitated?"

"Has the power of your sword qi increased again?"

"Bai Zhenzhen, you haven't even tried it yourself yet, have you?"

"Then watch closely! I, Kuang Tianqing, will seize this Immortal Scum before you!"

Under Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's fierce resistance, Kuang Tianqing's figure shattered repeatedly, only to reform again and again.

With each reappearance, her alluring form drew closer to Zhang Yu's vital points.

Though Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen tried every method they knew to dispel the illusion, it was as if nothing they did could interrupt Kuang Tianqing's next move. They remained trapped by the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body's influence.

"Damn it!" Bai Zhenzhen roared, her sword qi intensifying to a crimson hue, as if blood were about to drip from it.

Zhang Yu felt his vital energy and Magic Power surging faster and faster, as if Kuang Tianqing were stirring them into a frenzy.

"No... we can't let this continue..." Zhang Yu thought grimly. "We've tried every method recorded in our intelligence to break the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body, but all have failed."

"That leaves only one possibility... the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body has evolved."

"The Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body we face now has surpassed the information in our records."

With this thought, Zhang Yu immediately sent a message to A-Zhen: A-Zhen! Retreat!

Zhang Yu: Until we figure out how to break the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body, Kuang Tianqing must stop fighting.

The moment the exchange ended, their figures flickered and shot away.

Under the power of the Divine Spiritual Root, their forms vanished simultaneously, as if their existence had been completely erased from the world.

Watching this, Kuang Tianqing chuckled softly. "Think you can escape?"

Meanwhile, above the arena, ten divine lights descended from the principals of the Ten Great Universities, converging to observe the fierce battle unfolding on the floating continent below.

The light representing Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution flickered slightly as the principal of Myriad Laws University spoke, his voice resonating through the light: "Old Unrestrained, when was the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique updated? I wasn't aware of this."

From the divine light representing Heavenly Demon University, Divine Monarch Unrestrained chuckled softly. "It's a beta version. Kuang Tianqing happened to be participating in the project update, so she learned it along the way. If you're concerned about the formalities, I can show you the documentation."

"You've truly gone to great lengths to secure this first place," Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution remarked dryly.

Divine Monarch Unrestrained chuckled again. "It's just the students causing a ruckus down there. We're merely going with the flow."

---

Amidst the howling wind and swirling grass, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen instantly traversed over a thousand meters.

Yet even during this rapid displacement, they couldn't shake off Kuang Tianqing's phantom, which materialized repeatedly, relentlessly pursuing them.

Protected by their Divine Spiritual Roots, their physical bodies remained invisible.

However, in Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's perception, they could still see Kuang Tianqing gripping Zhang Yu, chuckling softly, "Bai Zhenzhen, are you watching? He's finally reacting! He's reacting in my grasp!"

With a soft *whoosh*, crimson sword qi grazed Kuang Tianqing's phantom, shattering it and startling Zhang Yu.

"No..." Zhang Yu thought grimly. "This Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique warps perception across vast areas. Unless we escape Kuang Tianqing's influence in one breath, we'll never shake her off."

"Even with the Divine Spiritual Roots concealing us, our high-speed movement creates too much commotion. It allows Kuang Tianqing to pinpoint our general location and activate the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique to distort perception across a wide area..."

"What do we do?"

"How can we break free from Kuang Tianqing's illusionary influence?!"

Just as Zhang Yu's mind raced with possibilities, Bai Zhenzhen suddenly called out, "Yu Zi!"

Zhang Yu turned to look at Bai Zhenzhen, following her gaze, and a sudden chill ran through him.

Bai Zhenzhen trembled slightly, her voice filled with resentment and humiliation as she said, "If we continue like this, we won't be able to stop her from further humiliating you."

"She's preying on you, little by little."

"Once she completes dual cultivation with you and begins draining your body, you'll slowly lose all resistance."

"Then there's only one way left."

Crimson sword qi surged around her as Bai Zhenzhen declared, "Yu Zi, let's just get rid of it. Erase your weakness completely. Don't give Kuang Tianqing another chance to exploit you!"

Zhang Yu opened his mouth to protest, but no words came out.

"Is this really the only way?"

"Damn it, think! Think of a way to break through this predicament!"

"What should I do?!"

As Bai Zhenzhen stepped closer, each stride amplifying the sword qi around her, Zhang Yu's thoughts raced faster and faster.

"The Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body can't be flawless."

"There must be a weakness... but can I figure it out?"

"Damn it, if Master were here... what would she do?"

A sudden realization struck Zhang Yu, and he shouted, "Wait, A-Zhen!"

Simultaneously, countless artifact refinement blueprints flashed through his mind. He selected one for a magical artifact capable of resisting illusions and activated the power of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology.

In the next instant, a flood of knowledge and memories — both his own and those of True Monarch Magnetic Pole — surfaced in his mind, constantly refining the blueprint until a completely new design emerged.

"This is it!"

"The magical artifact design we created together with Master, capable of countering the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body!"

However, Zhang Yu knew he didn't have time to refine the artifact now.

Yet studying the blueprint's details could help him devise a way to counter the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body.

"Oh? So this is the potential weakness in the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body that Master and I discovered together?"

With a soft *snap*, Zhang Yu seized Kuang Tianqing's descending hand.

This time, there was no illusory dissipation. Zhang Yu felt the solid weight of her body, breaking through the sensory distortions.

Under Kuang Tianqing's astonished gaze, Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "Finally... I've caught you!"
