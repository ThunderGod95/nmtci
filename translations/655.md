# Chapter 655: Kunxu Needs Zhang Yu

Within the Spirit Realm, Zhao Tianxing abruptly awoke from darkness, crying out in alarm, "The connection's been severed!"

He remembered being on the finals battlefield, assisting Zhang Yu in operating his magical artifact as they engaged in a fierce battle against Kuang Tianqing's Soul Cultivators.

But during the final clash, in a desperate, all-out attack from both sides, the magical artifact malfunctioned and collapsed, severing his connection to it.

"If even basic Spirit Realm connectivity is impossible, the magical artifact and Bionic must be completely non-operational..."

Zhao Tianxing's heart tightened at this thought. He immediately sent a message to the group chat to inquire about the situation, then quickly opened the live broadcast of the event in the Spirit Realm, switching to the Final Battle footage.

The group chat, named "Ace Soul Cultivator Support Group," comprised all the Soul Cultivators who had accompanied Zhang Yu to the Ten Greats League, along with Zhang Yu himself.

As Zhao Tianxing's inquiry spread, others like Che Yufei, Hu Yuntao, Mo Tianyi, and the Ying Clan Patriarch all replied, revealing that they had also been disconnected during the final clash.

Meanwhile, Zhao Tianxing watched as the battlefield on the livestream was completely engulfed in an explosion, swallowing both Kuang Tianqing and Zhang Yu whole. Their figures vanished without a trace.

Zhao Tianxing stared anxiously at the livestream, muttering to himself, "Ah, in the end, we couldn't help at all. Everything now depends on Zhang Yu alone."

"What if we lose? I was the first to disconnect — will I be blamed the most?"

"And I'm just a Junior College Student..."

The thought made Zhao Tianxing even more nervous.

Even though he was now an employee of Zhang Yu's company, his status as a Junior College Student had always made him feel inferior within the company, making him overly sensitive to others' opinions.

In truth, Junior College Students like him and Mo Tianyi, though technically colleagues with Che Yufei, Hu Yuntao, and the Ying Clan Patriarch, never truly fit in with them socially.

Whenever project issues arose, Zhao Tianxing would always worry it was his fault, fearing criticism.

Now, as the first Soul Cultivator to disconnect during the final battle, his anxiety only intensified.

He clicked on Zhang Yu's profile, wanting to apologize, but quickly deleted the message and changed it to "Good luck!" Then he hesitated, realizing Zhang Yu was in a life-or-death struggle with Kuang Tianqing. Sending a message now would only distract him.

As Zhao Tianxing pondered, the platform commentator's voice boomed through the livestream: "The Righteous God has intervened! The outcome is decided!"

"Let's see who the final champion is!"

Zhao Tianxing whipped his head around to see Zhang Yu's figure slowly emerging from the dissipating light and heat of the explosion on the livestream screen.

Simultaneously, the radiant figures of the ten Soul Transformation principals from the Ten Great Universities descended one by one.

The commentator exclaimed in shock: "The Great God of Sentient Creation has descended!"

"The Great God seems to be speaking to Zhang Yu. We can't hear what they're saying, but Zhang Yu looks utterly astonished."

"The Great God is casting some kind of Talisman on Zhang Yu..."

"The results are in! The Righteous God has announced the final outcome: the victor is... Zhang Yu! Zhang Yu from Myriad Laws University!"

The commentator shouted excitedly: "Just a fifth-year student, he has defeated Kuang Tianqing! He's become the champion of this year's Ten Greats League! Now he is undeniably the strongest undergraduate among the Ten Greats!"

"Tomorrow at the same time, after the awards ceremony, he will personally select an Immortal Sect Technique from the Dao Repository Catalog live on air."

"This cultivation art will completely transform the future ecology of Kunxu!"

"Zhang Yu will determine the trajectory of Kunxu from the First to Tenth Layers."

"The world needs Zhang Yu!"

Zhao Tianxing stared blankly at the live broadcast, watching Zhang Yu board the Flying Boat. Thunderous thoughts crashed through his mind, leaving him speechless for a long moment.

He recalled their first year of high school, when Zhang Yu's grades had actually ranked below his own. Yet, year after year, Zhang Yu had gradually surpassed him, becoming not only the strongest student at Songyang High School but later the strongest in Songyang City, and then the strongest high school student on the First Layer.

Now, after climbing to the Second Layer, Zhang Yu had steadily achieved the title of the strongest undergraduate.

And Zhao Tianxing himself had followed closely behind Zhang Yu, step by step ascending to the highest stage of the University Realm, where he had shone brightly in clashes against the strongest university students.

As these memories flooded back, notifications from the Calculation Pool flashed across Zhao Tianxing's vision, reminding him of the ongoing charges.

Normally, he would have stopped reminiscing at this point, clearing his mind to minimize thought and reduce the cost of living.

But this time, Zhao Tianxing ignored the notifications. He simply let the emotions surging within him wash over him, eager to share his feelings with the world.

When Zhao Tianxing opened his school groups, hometown groups, and work groups, he found them flooded with messages, countless people trying to reach him.

School teachers messaged him: "Zhao Tianxing, the school is planning a study conference, and we'd like you to speak as the student representative..."

His class director asked if he was interested in preparing for the Junior College to Bachelor's Degree Program.

Various classmates and former colleagues sent their congratulations.

School loans and bank loans sent notifications inviting him to increase his credit limits, informing him that a reserve fund was waiting for him to use...

Overwhelmed by these developments, Zhao Tianxing thought, "My life has been completely transformed."

Whether Zhang Yu could change Kunxu or the world, Zhao Tianxing didn't know.

But one thing was crystal clear: Zhang Yu had already completely changed Zhao Tianxing's world.

Zhao Tianxing tried to contact Zhang Yu, sending the congratulatory message he had been drafting in his mind for days, but received no response.

He reassured himself, "Zhang Yu must be very busy right now, that's why he hasn't replied."

Just then, Zhao Tianxing received a message from an unknown number: "Student Zhao Tianxing, there are some matters we hope you can inform Student Zhang Yu about."

The other party said: Hundreds of millions of Soul Cultivators in Kunxu are hoping for his salvation.

"Kunxu Needs Zhang Yu!"

Hu Yuntao chuckled at the news headline and immediately forwarded the link to the Songyang Hometown Group and various Celestial Monsters University groups.

Hu Yuntao, a graduate of Red Pagoda High School on the First Layer, had faced constant attacks at Celestial Monsters University. Whether for his First Layer origins, his later bankruptcy and transformation into a Soul Cultivator, or his role as Zhang Yu's mouthpiece in insulting the monsterfolk, he had always been a target of criticism.

Today, he finally felt vindicated.

Hu Yuntao: Little bastards, you all mocked me for being a Human Race Soul Cultivator.

Hu Yuntao: Now tell me, what's wrong with being a Soul Cultivator?

Hu Yuntao: If I hadn't died, would I have had a chance to defeat Kuang Tianqing?

Hu Yuntao: You may still be alive, but you're worse off than I am, already dead.

Just then, Hu Yuntao received a message from Xiong Wenwu.

Xiong Wenwu: The opportunity to completely end monsterfolk discrimination, erase the conflict between humans and monsters, and resolve the millennia-old hatred between our races has arrived.

And the key lies in Zhang Yu's hands...

Reading the message, Hu Yuntao thought, "Such a momentous event... do we even have a say in this?"

But then he realized, "If even small figures like Xiong Wenwu and I are being contacted, how many others close to President Zhang are being targeted?"

He forwarded the situation to Zhang Yu but received no reply.

Hu Yuntao wondered, "What could President Zhang be doing right now?"

In the Civil Engineering Department office, Director Gao gazed at the final competition results, sighed, and slowly closed his eyes.

Beside him, Tu Lishan watched Zhang Yu's final image materialize, his body trembling slightly with excitement. "He won!" he exclaimed. "Teacher! Zhang Yu won!"

Tu Lishan turned to Director Gao, his Bionic Eye displaying a flood of group messages.

Civil Engineering Department Teachers' Group Chat:

Deputy Director Lin: Director, congratulations! [fireworks][fireworks][fireworks] Who dares say our Civil Engineering Department lacks Heavenly Chosen now?

True Monarch Sacred Mountain (Note: Former Civil Engineering Department Head): I said Zhang Yu had potential back in his freshman year. Sure enough, he excelled in smart building technology.

As Tu Lishan scrolled through the messages, he couldn't help but smile. But when he glanced at Director Gao, he saw no trace of amusement on his face.

Within Director Gao's Bionic Eye, messages from Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution and Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations appeared:

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: Xiao Gao, once Zhang Yu recovers, we need to hold a meeting with him. You should attend too.

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations: Chongguang, this is an unprecedented opportunity for Myriad Laws. Speak to Zhang Yu carefully and make him understand the importance of the Dharma Realm.

Director Gao's mind stirred. He scrolled upward through his messages and saw that the last message from the principal had been sent nearly fifty years ago.

His gaze flickered as he glanced at the news in the Spirit Realm. He noticed that discussions about which Immortal Sect Technique Zhang Yu should choose had begun to surface.

"Zhang Yu must continue Kuang Tianqing's path, extending life for all under heaven, for all living beings!"

"A once-in-a-millennium turning point is at hand. The opportunity to resolve the conflict between humans and monsters is within reach..."

"Revive all Soul Cultivators and end the blood and tears in the Spirit Realm..."

"What Myriad Laws University needs most right now is medical technology to drastically lower healthcare costs..."

As he read these messages, Director Gao thought to himself, "The storm is coming."

He sent a message to Magnetic Pole: Zhang Yu won the championship and will choose his cultivation art tomorrow.

Director Gao: I fear he's already under immense pressure.

Director Gao: Even after tomorrow's selection, the situation won't ease. The conflict will only intensify.

Director Gao: When will you emerge from seclusion?

Magnetic Pole remained silent, as usual.

Director Gao then sent a message to Zhang Yu, but received no reply.

He thought to himself, "Zhang Yu... how are you holding up?"

Outside the arena of the Ten Greats League, Ye Xingli couldn't help but slap her thigh as she watched Zhang Yu emerge from the explosion.

She immediately pinned the Chaos Soil Eater, a device she and Zhang Yu had co-designed, to her livestream. Then, she shrank her own name, enlarged Zhang Yu's, and added the caption: "The strongest undergraduate, after touring Vocational Colleges, personally designed this magical artifact — the perfect tool for Junior College Students!"

Simultaneously, her livestream chat exploded with messages.

Many fans urged her to interview Zhang Yu.

But when Ye Xingli tried to contact him, she discovered he had vanished without a trace. Even Zhang Yu's Flying Boat had been completely sealed off.

"Where did Zhang Yu go?"
