# Chapter 462: Zhang Yu's Soaring Spirit Coins

Amidst the deafening roar, Zhang Yu unleashed the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, his fists pounding relentlessly into the earth below.

Each sweep of Earthly Fiend Gravity sent shockwaves through the land, as if the earth itself were enduring an endless earthquake, threatening to tear everything above and below into shreds.

Countless clouds of mud and sand coalesced into black dragon-like forms, swirling to crush every living creature in their path.

Multiple fields of Earthly Fiend Gravity materialized one after another, frantically locking onto every opponent.

As Zhang Yu's frenzied assault intensified, the characters in Chan Rong's Bionic Eye flashed wildly — messages from his teammates flooding in:

"Stop him now!"

"We can't hold on! If he keeps attacking, my Bionic will break!"

"Chan Rong, where are you?"

Chan Rong replied: "Hold on! Victory is within reach!"

Channeling the Great Sun Manifestations, Chan Rong hurled himself at Zhang Yu, unleashing searing flames again and again.

Seeing his teammates' desperate pleas, Chan Rong threw himself into the battle, unleashing a furious barrage of attacks against Zhang Yu.

But Zhang Yu remained unfazed. He allowed the scorching flames to engulf his body, ignored Chan Rong's frantic assault, and continued to slam his palms into the earth, seizing every moment to press his advantage.

Under the churning force of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, the ground below writhed like a boiling sea. Not only was the construction site utterly pulverized, but Chan Rong's teammates were forced to surrender one by one.

---

In the spectator stands of the Spirit Realm, Wan Gouxuan remarked, "It's over."

On the arena, Zhang Yu had just repelled all of Chan Rong's teammates. He now focused entirely on defense, constantly concealing his position and evading attacks. He no longer attacked Chan Rong, content to simply keep him pinned down.

"If he can hold out a little longer," Wan Gouxuan continued, "Myriad Laws University's formation will be complete."

"Zhang Yu only needs to retreat slightly to gain the formation's enhancement, making him even more impervious to Chan Rong's attacks."

"Chan Rong can't break through Zhang Yu's full-fledged defense, nor can he defeat the other members of Myriad Laws University."

The rest of the match unfolded exactly as Wan Gouxuan had predicted. Until the final whistle, Chan Rong remained unable to defeat Zhang Yu.

Wan Gouxuan concluded, "Ultimately, Vajra University's Great Sun Manifestations are far inferior to Myriad Laws University's Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power."

"The versatility and raw power of these two military-grade cultivation techniques are worlds apart."

"Even if Chan Rong's mastery of his military-grade technique is deeper, it won't make a difference."

Yue Guanqiong, standing beside him, said coldly, "In that case, we still have a chance to face Myriad Laws University in this year's Inter-University League."

Wan Gouxuan frowned. "If it were just Zhang Yu alone, it wouldn't be a problem."

"While his talent is exceptional, his progress in Martial Dao Techniques is astonishingly rapid, and his tactical acumen is remarkable, his protective cultivation arts are both resilient and formidable... he simply lacks the wealth."

Yue Guanqiong nodded slightly. A lack of wealth was a far greater weakness than mediocre talent.

After all, with enough money, even someone with ordinary talent could overcome obstacles in short order. Conversely, even extraordinary talent couldn't guarantee sudden riches.

Yue Guanqiong analyzed, "No matter how quickly he advances in martial arts, without the funds to acquire the Seven Absolutes Bionic or afford top-tier magical artifacts in this competition, his operational and destructive limits will ultimately fall short of ours."

"He'll likely resort to exploiting his cultivation art's advantages to bully Chan Rong, who cultivates the Great Sun Manifestations."

Wan Gouxuan and Yue Guanqiong were now concerned about a different matter.

While they were confident they could suppress and ultimately defeat Zhang Yu alone, what if Mo Shangjin were added to the equation?

At this moment, Mo Shangjin, still recovering from severe injuries and with his return uncertain, loomed as the darkest cloud over their minds.

---

Outside the arena, Chan Rong stopped the Myriad Laws University team.

Zhang Yu tilted his head. "Something you need?"

"How much for a friend slot?" Chan Rong asked.

"Huh?" Zhang Yu blinked.

"I'll offer twelve Spirit Coins at most," Chan Rong stated.

After witnessing Zhang Yu's performance in the battle, Chan Rong had concluded that securing a friend slot with him was a worthwhile investment, a potential source of future profit.

What particularly intrigued Chan Rong was Zhang Yu's astonishing martial prowess despite possessing only a single Bionic Eye. To Chan Rong, this made him an exceptional prospect.

Zhang Yu's extraordinary martial arts skills indicated a strong earning potential. Even if he lacked funds now, he would inevitably accumulate wealth in the coming years.

Meanwhile, his sole Bionic Eye suggested immense pent-up demand. Once he had money, he would undoubtedly spend lavishly.

After all, Zhang Yu was a Civil Engineering student, not an Artifact Refinement major capable of crafting his own Bionics or magical artifacts. He would need to purchase them all.

"Zhang Yu might not be able to afford new Bionics or use many magical artifacts now, but he'll inevitably need to buy them in the future," Chan Rong reasoned.

"He can't possibly rely on just one set of Myriad Laws University's Seven Absolutes Bionics," Chan Rong thought. "He'll need backups for different situations and to minimize wear and tear on his main set..."

The outcome of the match wouldn't affect Chan Rong's determination to seize this money-making opportunity.

Despite losing to Zhang Yu, Chan Rong and his teammates had surrendered promptly, minimizing their losses.

Unlike last year, when Mo Shangjin had shattered their entire Bionics and magical artifacts with a single strike.

Zhang Yu, unaware of Chan Rong's thoughts, haggled for a while and sold his friend slot for 13 Spirit Coins, happily increasing his bank balance.

Aboard the Flying Boat leaving Vajra University, Mo Shangjin's projection said, "You performed well in this match."

"Especially Zhang Yu. He effectively leveraged the advantages of his Cultivation Art to compensate for the gap in cultivation power..."

Su Yanyang, recalling the battle, thought with a hint of relief, "Thank goodness Zhang Yu mastered the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. I can coast through the remaining matches, conserve my Immortal Dao Potential, and rely mainly on him."

Despite their recent victory, Mo Shangjin quickly brought new pressure to the team.

"Based on the competition schedule and their demonstrated strength, Heavenly Sword University and Immortal Armaments University are likely to be our toughest opponents in the upcoming matches."

"I watched their previous competitions, and both teams are exceptionally strong this year."

Mo Shangjin continued, "Here are videos of their matches. You can review them later."

Zhang Yu casually clicked on a video and watched as Heavenly Sword University's team cleaved the arena in two with a single sword strike, and Immortal Armaments University's giant puppet overturned the entire battlefield. He was struck by the astonishing power of these teams.

At the same time, Mo Shangjin added, "In terms of raw strength, both of these teams are currently stronger than ours."

"Moreover, both universities harbor a particular animosity toward Myriad Laws University."

Zhang Yu asked curiously, "A particular animosity? Why?"

Mo Shangjin sighed. "It's old grudges left over from our seniors. I've been trying to resolve these conflicts for years, but without success."

"In any case, you must be extremely cautious when facing them."

As Zhang Yu watched the match videos between Heavenly Sword University and Immortal Armaments University, he thought to himself, "As time passes, the strength I can reveal will gradually increase, making me stronger and stronger."

"But beyond that, the most suitable area for me to enhance my power... is through magical artifacts."

Through his recent practice and application of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, Zhang Yu had begun to sense that the magical artifacts he had crafted last year were no longer keeping pace with his growth.

"They're still useful for minor tasks during construction," he mused.

"But when I fully unleash the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, they're no longer a good match."

Zhang Yu thought, "If I get the chance, upgrading all my magical artifacts would significantly boost my strength."

"But all of this requires money and technical expertise."

As for money, Zhang Yu remembered he still needed to cover the construction workers' wages.

Technical expertise would require further study — artifact crafting in the lab, simulated experiments in the Spirit Realm — all of which also cost money.

"Sigh, I'll just have to wait for the project funds to arrive."

Civil Engineering Department Faculty Group Chat.

Wei Huai, the geology professor for the Civil Engineering Department, said: "The higher-ups are investigating Zhang Yu's rapid mastery of the Four Absolutes."

Wei Huai: "This might not be entirely compliant with regulations."

Tu Lishan: "It's all for the department's performance this year. The higher-ups will understand."

Wei Huai: "I'm worried that even if we bend the rules, our results might still fall short."

Wei Huai: "Students from the other Ten Greats universities have been diligently cultivating military-grade techniques, building a solid foundation."

Wei Huai: "Zhang Yu's rushed approach lacks that foundation. I fear even mastering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power won't make him a match for them."

Tu Lishan: "Congratulations to the Competition Team for their victory over Vajra University! 🎉🎉🎉"

Tu Lishan: "Director Gao, I've asked Mo Shangjin to upload the competition video."

Director Gao read the chat log with a cold smile.

He understood that Wei Huai's concerns were merely a mouthpiece for Director Lin.

While Zhang Yu's accelerated training had successfully allowed him to master the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering in record time, Director Gao knew the Peace Faction was likely waiting to gloat over his failure, eager to find fault.

Still, the kid has shown promise, Director Gao thought.

Looking at the competition schedule, he sighed inwardly. Next month, we might face Heavenly Sword University or Immortal Armaments University. Their Civil Engineering departments are tough nuts to crack.

Meanwhile, Director Gao recalled True Monarch Cloud Haven's recent interest in the Civil Engineering Department.

He knew Principal Cloud Haven had been closely monitoring the department's performance. After all, Zhang Yu was the principal's chosen candidate, and poor results would reflect badly on him, especially if Director Lin and the Finance Department launched another attack.

Therefore, after today's victory against Vajra University, Director Gao immediately reported the news to True Monarch Cloud Haven.

True Monarch Cloud Haven replied: "Good."

Director Gao: "Zhang Yu recently started a company and secured a project from our university."

Director Gao: "It's a small company with tight cash flow. I was wondering if the university could lend a hand."

True Monarch Cloud Haven: "The university has always supported student entrepreneurship."

True Monarch Cloud Haven: "I'll speak to them and expedite the process."

True Monarch Cloud Haven: "Tell Zhang Yu and his team to keep working hard."

True Monarch Cloud Haven: "Strive for a top-three finish. The prizes for the top three in this Inter-University League are quite impressive."

Reading True Monarch Cloud Haven's response, Director Gao breathed a sigh of relief. He thought, "Now Zhang Yu's company should receive the project funds without much delay."

This would undoubtedly boost Zhang Yu's capabilities, helping him lead the Competition Team to even greater success.

Time flew by, and before he knew it, it was early February.

On this day, Zhang Yu had just finished all his project work. He activated the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power and soared into the sky, flying toward University City.

He occasionally checked his messages along the way.

Feng Tingting: Ah! My term paper got rejected!

Seeing Feng Tingting's complaint, Zhang Yu knew that in the Artifact Refinement Department, papers became increasingly important as students advanced through the grades.

This importance would only grow further at the Golden Core and Nascent Soul stages.

After all, the Golden Core qualification still required an exam, while the Nascent Soul qualification, though exempt from exams, demanded a paper, achievements, peer reviews, and a whole series of other requirements.

Just then, Zhang Yu's eyes flashed as he noticed the project payment had been directly deposited into his account.

His Spirit Coin balance had suddenly skyrocketed to over 140!
