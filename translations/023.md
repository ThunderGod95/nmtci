# Chapter 23: Negotiations

One in the morning.

Having finished his security shift, Zhang Yu navigated the crowded subways and buses, making his way back to his rented room in the suburbs.

As for why the public transit was still packed at one in the morning, it was naturally because this was the evening rush hour for the night shift in Songyang City, teeming with commuters.

Back home, he first took a shower, then glanced at his account balance, wondering if he could finally afford an air conditioner.

After all, with a deposit of 8,300, his finances for the month suddenly felt much more comfortable.

But then he remembered that the next month was only two weeks away, and he would have to repay a 15,000 loan, which made him frown.

He recalled what Bai Zhenzhen had said.

*The school's contract?* he murmured to himself.

If signing a contract could provide him a large sum of money each month, he would not have to worry about the loan anymore.

However, Zhang Yu knew it was useless to overthink it. Whether it was his performance before the Celestial Paragon’s Martial Demonstration Scroll or the school’s contract, everything ultimately boiled down to his own talent and strength.

With this in mind, he took out the neural filler he had bought at the stationery shop by the school gate earlier that day and consumed it.

He then sat cross-legged on his bed and began to circulate the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method, feeling wisps of spiritual energy from the world flowing into his body.

Although he had switched the Feathered Tome’s specialization to the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art for the trial of the Celestial Paragon’s Martial Demonstration Scroll, he would have to wait twenty-four hours to switch it back to the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method to resume its rapid advancement.

But since his Dao heart was not yet level three, he couldn't practice the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art anyway, and he needed to prepare for the Mana Competition by increasing his mana.

Even though the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method could not be rapidly advanced for now, having already reached level four, it could still help him effectively increase his mana.

And so, the rest of the night passed in Zhang Yu’s silent breathing exercise.

…

Early the next morning.

The moment Zhang Yu stepped into the classroom, he noticed something was different.

Normally, the vast majority of students at Songyang High School were focused on their own studies and cultivation, paying little attention to the other, more ordinary students in their class.

Even two people in the same class might go months without exchanging a single word.

Just as how, every day when Zhang Yu entered the classroom, no one ever paid him any mind.

Only someone like Zhao Tianxing would wonder if his classmates were watching him every time he walked in.

But today was different; Zhang Yu could clearly feel furtive glances being cast his way from the moment he entered.

The instant Zhang Yu sat down, Zhou Tianyi clapped him on the shoulder and said, “The news that you were accepted as a disciple by a Golden Core True Monarch has spread throughout the class.”

“It seems like the few people who went to the art exhibition with Qian Shen mentioned it in the group chat.”

It was a well-known fact that schools were one of the fastest places in the world for rumors to spread.

And as a key institution, Songyang High School had immense pressure to cultivate, a surplus of celibate youths, and a mobile phone in every hand, which only accelerated the dissemination of gossip.

Forget text messages; even a photo of Zhang Yu in his security guard uniform from yesterday was already making the rounds in the group chat.

Zhang Yu let out a chuckle at this.

“Has the class started spreading tales of my exploits? Truly the speed of Songyang. Let them talk.”

In these days of being forced into ascetic training, feeling the attention and discussion of others regarding his excellent performance was a rare pleasure for Zhang Yu.

But he immediately pursed his lips, thinking of a complication.

Yesterday, Li Xuelian had secretly called him into a small meeting to inform him of her rejection.

This meant that many of the people who had been present didn't know he had actually been turned down by the Golden Core True Monarch. They all still believed what Li Xuelian had announced on the floor—that he was to be taken as a disciple.

*It would be pretty stupid of me to run up to the podium and clarify things now.*

*Whatever, let them say what they want. They'll probably forget about it after a while.*

Zhang Yu closed his eyes and resumed circulating the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method, absorbing spiritual energy through his breathing exercise.

The chatter of his classmates was nothing more than a temporary amusement.

As he had planned, his primary goal was still to focus all his efforts on increasing his mana in preparation for the city-wide Mana Competition.

This time, however, Zhang Yu had only taken a few breaths before he was called out of the room by his class advisor, Su Haifeng.

…

He remembered the last time Su Haifeng had called him for a talk; it was on his third day in this world.

At that time, his understanding of Songyang High School and its teachers was still superficial.

He had even initially mistaken Su Haifeng for a kind teacher who cared for students in need.

But now, standing outside the classroom and walking behind Su Haifeng, Zhang Yu could feel the terrifying pressure emanating from the model class advisor who was also the grade director.

Wherever Su Haifeng passed, the classrooms instantly fell silent, and students trembled.

Qian Shen didn't dare move a muscle, focusing intently on his breathing exercise.

Zhao Tianxing, who had just stood up to go to the restroom, quickly sat back down and picked up a book to read.

Even Bai Zhenzhen sat bolt upright like a primary schooler, her eyes fixed on the textbook before her.

Everyone’s nerves were stretched taut, all of them hoping Su Haifeng’s gaze wouldn’t land on them.

This was Su Haifeng, the first-year grade director of Songyang High School, the devil incarnate in the hearts of countless Songyang students, and the author of the research paper, “On the Application Prospects of Electric Shock in High School Education.”

This was a man so intimidating that a stray dog would feel compelled to read a few pages if it passed him by.

Zhang Yu followed Su Haifeng through this oppressive scholarly field and into the office, where the demon king smiled at him and said, “I heard True Monarch Xinghuo wants to take you as a disciple?”

Zhang Yu had no intention of deceiving the school into thinking he had become a disciple of a Golden Core expert. A lie about his apprenticeship would be easily exposed, putting him in a difficult position.

So he told the truth, “No. I felt True Monarch Xinghuo’s offer was a bit lacking, so I rejected it.”

The corner of Su Haifeng’s mouth twitched.

This Zhang Yu came from a poor family and hadn’t given him a single gift in the three months since school started. Now, after a brief moment in the spotlight, he was already putting on airs.

*Is he trying to… drive up his price for the contract?*

As expected, these paupers were prone to getting inflated egos.

If that was the case, however, Su Haifeng suspected that signing the contract in a few moments would not be so easy.

“I see.” After a moment of thought, he produced a document and said, “The school is aware of your performance at the art exhibition in the Central Tower.”

“Although your grades have slipped recently, you’ve been criticized by the physical education teacher, you haven’t been proactive about purchasing medicine, and a debt collection agency even called my office, the school is still dedicated to nurturing talent and has decided to offer you some assistance.”

Zhang Yu’s eyes narrowed at his words.

Worthy of being Songyang High School’s resident devil; a master manipulator right out of the gate.

Zhang Yu recalled what Bai Zhenzhen had said about a contract and guessed this was all a prelude to negotiating its terms.

And just as he expected, Su Haifeng placed the document in front of him and continued, “The school has prepared a student aid contract for you. The terms are much better than the previous financial aid plan for impoverished students. Take a look and see if there are any issues.”

Zhang Yu took it and gave it a quick scan, discovering that upon signing, the school would give him ten thousand a month. However, the money had to be repaid, though the interest rate was significantly lower than a loan.

Furthermore, it stipulated that regardless of whether he was admitted to a university, he would be required to work for a company under the school’s affiliated education group for ten years.

Songyang High School was part of the Myriad Stars Education Group, which in turn was under the Myriad Laws Sect, one of the Ten Great Sects.

In other words, signing this contract meant Zhang Yu would have to work for the Myriad Stars Education Group for a decade.

Additionally, during the university application process, Songyang High School would have the right to decide which university and major he applied to.

“Ten thousand a month for me to sign this kind of indenture contract?”

Even without seeing any other student’s contract, Zhang Yu could tell this one was insulting.

Zhang Yu put the document down and said with a frown, “Sir, isn’t this compensation too low? I make 800 an hour as a security guard at the Central Tower.”

“Can a temporary job be a long-term solution?” Su Haifeng retorted, then shifted his tone. “I know the terms of this contract are a bit low, but the school’s leadership has its reasons.”

“After all, regarding the trial with the Celestial Paragon’s Martial Demonstration Scroll at the art exhibition—what was the content? What were the selection criteria? What were the specific qualities of the candidates? The school has no firsthand information and thus cannot make its own judgment, not to mention you failed to master the martial art in the end.”

“On the contrary, your academic performance has shown a marked decline this month.”

“The school is, ultimately, a place that values grades. The six-subject, 700-point evaluation system is certainly more in line with the Immortal Dao, more rational, and more highly regarded by the board of directors than the Celestial Paragon’s Martial Demonstration Scroll. The contract process is bound by this reality…”

Zhang Yu’s frown deepened, because what Su Haifeng said was not without reason.

At Songyang High School, academic scores were the ultimate priority.

After all, besides him, no one at the school knew the true difficulty and power of the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art, much less that it required a level three Dao heart.

And Zhang Yu did not have the right to disseminate the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art, nor did he have anyone to vouch for his claims about it.

Zhang Yu said, “There’s no way I can accept this contract.”

Su Haifeng smiled slightly, thinking to himself, *Is he about to ask for more?*

He said lightly, “Don’t be so hasty. I’m your class advisor, after all. I can help you fight for a better offer.”

Zhang Yu asked, “Can it be as good as the terms you gave Bai Zhenzhen?”

Su Haifeng didn’t answer directly. He simply laughed, but the meaning behind his laughter was self-evident.

Then he said, “I’m not in charge of Bai Zhenzhen’s contract, but I can give you a response. Bai Zhenzhen is number one in our grade with 650 points. What’s your score?”

Zhang Yu countered, “Does that mean if I become number one in the grade, everything is negotiable?”

Looking at Zhang Yu’s serious face, Su Haifeng smiled and took the contract back.

“How well you can score depends on your own ability.”

“The contracts are primarily based on grades. While there can be some flexibility in the details, they are generally divided into four tiers: A, B, C, and D.”

“The monthly exam is in two weeks. If you’re not satisfied with a D-tier contract, we can wait until your results are out and continue this discussion then.”
