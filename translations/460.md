# Chapter 460: Zhang Yu Battles Chan Rong

As Chan Rong spoke, Zhang Yu shot into the sky like a meteor, hurtling directly toward him.

Ignoring Chan Rong's words completely, Zhang Yu unleashed a palm strike. The Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power erupted, unleashing the Comet Bombardment from the Ten Phases of Suppressing Stars.

Amidst a cacophony of explosive cracks, the Earthly Fiend Gravity tore through the atmosphere, shattering it layer by layer with terrifying force.

At the epicenter of this gravity, Chan Rong felt as if mountains were crushing him, his bones emitting brittle cracking sounds.

Simultaneously, the distorted atmosphere, driven by the Earthly Fiend Gravity's shockwaves, converged violently upon Chan Rong. It swirled around him like a vortex, violently shaking like a white-hot comet.

When the Earthly Fiend Gravity reached its peak, the atmosphere shattered with a deafening roar.

Yet amidst this earth-shattering explosion, the flames engulfing Chan Rong burned even brighter, radiating an even more dazzling light.

As if transitioning from dawn to midday, the flames intensified to a scorching midday heat, causing waves of distorted air to ripple across the arena.

Chan Rong cracked his neck and glanced at Zhang Yu, saying calmly, "Impressive power."

Chan Rong raised a finger to the sky and declared, "But with the blessing of my Vajra Profound Creation-forged Bionic, how could your attack possibly harm me?"

At that moment, an advertisement for Vajra Profound Creation materialized above the arena.

In the Spirit Realm audience stands, students from Vajra University watched the scene and exclaimed, "What a brilliant advertisement! No wonder Senior Brother Chan Rong took that hit head-on — he was promoting Vajra Profound Creation!"

Another student added, "Genius! Senior Brother Chan Rong hasn't even thrown a punch yet, and he's already earning Spirit Coins. He's completely dominating the match!"

Chan Rong turned to Zhang Yu and said, "Your turn is over. Now it's mine."

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened as he watched, his seriousness deepening.

"This guy... he's tough," Zhang Yu thought. "No surprise coming from Vajra University. Their combination of body refinement techniques and Bionics is truly impressive."

"And he's making money with every move? Damn, that's awesome."

"Why hasn't Myriad Laws University found me a sponsor yet?" Zhang Yu wondered.

Despite his thoughts, Zhang Yu didn't retreat an inch. He knew the key to this battle lay in Chan Rong's position.

Before the match began, Zhang Yu, Mo Shangjin, and their team had already strategized about facing Vajra University.

---

Mo Shangjin explained, "Chan Rong's Great Sun Manifestations have an immense destructive range. If our construction site falls within his attack radius, everyone will gradually be scorched, and our building materials will be incinerated one by one."

"At that point, construction will be impossible, and you won't last long before being forced to withdraw from the competition."

"Therefore, the first key to victory lies in Zhang Yu's ability to hold Chan Rong at bay, preventing his attacks from reaching Shi Huaiyu and the others."

"Conversely, if we can drive Chan Rong back to their construction site, their teammates will be the ones suffering."

Su Yanyang analyzed, "Chan Rong has undoubtedly anticipated our strategy. Once the battle begins, Zhang Yu and Chan Rong will likely become entangled at the front lines, with Chan Rong trying to shift the battlefield toward us and Zhang Yu trying to push it back toward them."

Mo Shangjin nodded. "Thus, the outcome of this battle doesn't rest solely on Zhang Yu's shoulders. While he clashes fiercely with Chan Rong, the efficiency of both teams' construction efforts will be crucial. Can you complete the Formation quickly enough to amplify Zhang Yu's combat power and weaken Chan Rong's?"

---

At that moment, flames erupted from Chan Rong's body, spewing scorching heat waves into the air. His long hair blazed like a pillar of fire, surging violently with the thermal currents.

Zhang Yu knew he couldn't retreat now. If he allowed Chan Rong to bring his teammates into the attack range, they would surely lose.

He stared directly at Chan Rong, the blinding white light assaulting his eyes, yet Zhang Yu refused to blink.

Before the battle, he had replaced both of his eyes with Time-Worn Demonic Eyes, instead of the usual single eye.

He was immensely grateful for this preparation. Without it, simply facing Chan Rong's gaze would have severely damaged his eyes, likely requiring exorbitant medical expenses.

All these thoughts flashed through Zhang Yu's mind in an instant.

Simultaneously, as Chan Rong spoke, his momentum reached its peak.

With the Great Sun Manifestations fully activated, his Magic Power surged within him like streams of solar radiance.

At Chan Rong's will, he could instantly heat any point within a hundred-meter radius. The smaller the targeted area, the faster the temperature would rise.

With a flick of his finger, a blazing fire erupted on Zhang Yu's body.

The intense light exploded within a thumb-sized area, shimmering like starlight and unleashing a violent surge of heat.

This was one of the Great Sun Manifestations' techniques: Firefly Radiance.

As Chan Rong's fingers flicked out one after another, each strike unleashing a burst of dazzling starlight, Zhang Yu's vital points erupted in blinding flashes. Simultaneously, Chan Rong's voice boomed across the arena: "Kid, remember, after your body's wrecked, you can buy a replacement at the Shedding Flesh Pavilion after the match. It's much cheaper than medical bills."

As Chan Rong pointed skyward, the advertisement in the sky shifted again, now displaying the Shedding Flesh Pavilion's logo.

In the audience, Vajra University students marveled: "He even managed to slip in an ad?"

"Brilliant! Every move Senior Brother Chan Rong makes earns him money."

"Meanwhile, Zhang Yu from Myriad Laws University loses money with every move. The difference in skill is clear as day!"

On the other side of the arena, Zhang Yu, battered by Chan Rong's relentless assault, surprisingly advanced instead of retreating. With a thunderous roar, he dodged the incoming strikes while rapidly shifting his palm stances. The Civil Engineering Holy Body within him activated, unleashing torrents of Earthly Fiend Gravity that erupted from his body, unleashing the full force of his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

Comet Bombardment!

With each brutal palm strike, Zhang Yu's attacks crushed Chan Rong's body like collapsing mountains, forcing him backward step by step.

At the same moment, Zhang Yu also pointed a finger skyward.

The audience leaned forward curiously. "Does he have an ad too?"

Zhang Yu roared, "Advertising space for rent!"

Chan Rong, observing the scene, burst into laughter. Feeling the terrifying pressure on his body, he casually remarked, "You're far weaker than Mo Shangjin."

"Your Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power is nowhere near Mo Shangjin's level — maybe around Level 10?"

"With such power... how could you possibly defeat me?"

As Chan Rong spoke, streams of firefly-like radiance erupted from his body.

Zhang Yu ignored the onslaught, letting the starlight explode across his body. While dodging vital spots, he unleashed a relentless barrage of Comet Bombardments, one after another, at his opponent.

From the moment they clashed, it became a face-to-face, earth-shattering brawl, each using extraordinary methods to tear apart the other's body.

Zhang Yu's body was soon covered in flickering flames. As his Gang Qi shattered repeatedly, his skin burned, leaving behind increasingly charred marks.

Under the crushing pressure of Earthly Fiend Gravity, Chan Rong's skin cracked continuously, spewing large patches of golden powder.

Zhang Yu repeatedly manipulated the Earthly Fiend Gravity, attempting to pull Chan Rong onto his construction site. Each time, Chan Rong erupted in flames to stabilize himself, placing even greater strain on his body.

In the Spirit Realm spectator stands above Saiyang, the audience watched the two combatants clash fiercely from the start, their blood boiling as they roared their approval.

"This is exhilarating! Keep fighting!"

"Good! Good! Best if they both go bankrupt — more job opportunities for us!"

"See? A death match is way more entertaining than watching ads."

"Don't stop! Fight until your loans run out!"

"Damn it! I love watching two Academic Overachievers tear each other apart, shredding each other's Immortal Dao potential!"

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu felt starlight continuously exploding across his body, yet his mind remained calm as he analyzed the situation.

"Right now, I'm using Earthly Fiend Gravity to compress Chan Rong's body. His stubborn resistance to being pushed back means we're locked in a contest of physical strength."

"While we clash, he's constantly heating my body, damaging my physical form, and weakening my combat power."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "If this continues, it'll come down to whether his body can withstand the crushing force of my Earthly Fiend Gravity first, or whether my physical form succumbs to his heat first."

"Right now, I'm enhancing my resistance with the Civil Engineering Holy Body to counter his Great Sun Manifestations. I should be able to endure his onslaught for quite some time."

"If I could fully unleash my Level 20 Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, I'd inevitably win this battle of attrition."

"But that would be far too shocking."

"I can't keep fighting like this."

With that thought, Zhang Yu reached down and grabbed.

Boom!

The earth erupted violently. Amidst the surging layers of mud and sand, a massive boulder shot skyward. Empowered by Zhang Yu's Earthly Fiend Gravity, it transformed into a meteor hurtling toward the Vajra University construction site.

Bang!

Driven by the frenzied force of the Earthly Fiend Gravity, the boulder shattered the air in an instant, leaving thunderous sonic booms in its wake.

Chan Rong's brow twitched as he witnessed this. He unleashed a glimmering burst of energy that violently shattered the meteor-like rock.

But in the next instant, even more rocks, propelled by the same force as Zhang Yu's earlier assault, shot skyward with a deafening roar.

The arena's airspace erupted in a continuous barrage of thunderous explosions, like an endless chain of lightning strikes.

Amid this relentless thunder, streams of rocks hurtled forth like a meteor shower, blanketing the Vajra University construction site.

Such a sustained bombardment would have reduced the site to rubble and inflicted severe injuries on Chan Rong's teammates.

Faced with Zhang Yu's feint-and-strike tactic, Chan Rong calmly shifted his focus.

He formed hand seals, and torrents of Gang Qi erupted from his body, intercepting the incoming rocks like fiery comets.

Instantly, as their attacks collided, shockwaves rippled across the arena's airspace in overlapping layers.

Each rock shattered upon impact, exploding like miniature suns that slowly ascended into the sky, stirring up clouds of dust and smoke.

Watching Zhang Yu vanish into the swirling dust, Chan Rong scoffed. "Planning to hide in the smoke?"
