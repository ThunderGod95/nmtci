# Chapter 611: The Toughest Corpse

The more Zhang Yu learned about Kuang Tianqing and the more he fought against her, the more he understood the vast gap between them.

Background, lineage, wealth, time... and the massive investment the Ten Greats League had poured into her.

He couldn't match her in any of these areas.

"I want to devour her, to seize her popularity and influence, to catch up to her in the competition, to increase my chances of winning the championship..."

"I have to use every ounce of power and every resource at my disposal. I have to stake everything."

"Even my life."

In the live broadcast watched by millions, Zhang Yu, trailing lines of Spirit Realm Projection text as he completed his Living Stake Transformation, crashed violently toward Kuang Tianqing's position.

"Kuang Tianqing! Dare you fight me to the death?"

Seeing Zhang Yu charging toward her, Kuang Tianqing didn't even need to read the projected text to sense his desperate resolve. She felt his earth-shattering fighting spirit, his life wagered, his unwavering determination to climb the Immortal Dao.

But...

"On what grounds?"

"Who authorized you to harbor such delusional ambitions?"

"I have the lineage of a Soul Transformation Master! I'm receiving tutoring from eight great Soul Transformation experts!"

"When it comes to grades, wealth, background, talent, and personal ability... what do you have that could possibly compare to me?"

"Do you even know how much money has been invested in me?"

"What's the value of your so-called fighting spirit, resolve, life... your pursuit of the Dao... your obsession with the Immortal Dao... compared to the nearly ten thousand Spirit Coins invested in me?"

"Do you understand the weight of these Spirit Coins I carry on my shoulders?"

With a furious roar, Kuang Tianqing's vital energy blazed violently. Her body seemed to shatter into fragments, peeling away and fracturing, only to instantly reassemble and regenerate.

If Zhang Yu had proactively embraced death, unleashing a life-consuming strike, then Kuang Tianqing was now wielding the power of destruction and rebirth, pushing her Immortal Dao Potential to its absolute limit.

"You want to die?! I'll grant your wish!"

Kuang Tianqing ignored the walls, armor, and structures converging from all directions. She saw at a glance that Zhang Yu, transformed into a Living Stake, was the key.

Shattering the Living Stake would shatter the entire formation and collapse all the structures.

Moreover, how could she, during this live-streamed final battle, allow herself to be pushed back by this Immortal Scum?

She would obliterate him head-on, crushing the Immortal Scum before her into nothingness.

*Boom!*

The constantly shattering and regenerating palm struck Zhang Yu with destructive force, showing no mercy.

Then came the second strike, the third strike...

"Immortal Scum! At my level of status, my power, my cultivation... they no longer belong to me alone."

"They are the wealth of society, the currents of Heaven and Earth."

"Where money flows, so goes the will of Heaven!"

"My net worth of nearly ten thousand Spirit Coins is Heaven's favor incarnate. Every action I take, every desire I pursue, is ordained by fate!"

As lines of Spirit Realm text projected across the arena, Kuang Tianqing's torrential, storm-like assault instantly engulfed Zhang Yu completely.

The countless viewers watching the live broadcast erupted in awe.

"These two are incredible! Even in the midst of such fierce combat, they still remember to broadcast and maintain the Spirit Realm text projections."

"This is the pinnacle competition of the Ten Great Universities. Enhancing their Immortal Dao Potential during combat is practically instinct for these students."

"Hmph, without such profit-generating abilities, how could they have ever progressed so far on the Immortal Dao path?"

A massive wave of viewers rallied behind Kuang Tianqing, supporting the top academic overachiever from Heavenly Demon University.

After all, compared to Zhang Yu, Kuang Tianqing was the truly wealthy one.

And wealth was synonymous with morality, wealth was synonymous with power, wealth was synonymous with acting in accordance with the heavens. The wealthier Kunxu was, the stronger it should be, and supporting the wealthy was simply a matter of upholding societal norms.

"With Kuang Tianqing's wealth, what chance does Zhang Yu have against her?!"

"Kuang Tianqing is so rich, how could she be trapped?!"

"If someone this rich can still lose, I seriously suspect this competition is rigged!"

"Kuang Tianqing! Beat this poor bastard to death!"

"Fucking hell, if working hard was enough, why would we need money?!"

Amidst the countless cheers, roars, and chants of support... Kuang Tianqing unleashed blow after blow upon Zhang Yu, determined to crush him utterly.

Yet with each attack, Kuang Tianqing grew increasingly astonished.

The Living Stake Transformation inherently enhanced the body's resilience, even fusing with the entire structure to become part of the formation. This not only amplified physical strength but also distributed a significant portion of the damage.

Furthermore, Zhang Yu's Civil Engineering Holy Body granted him vastly improved resistance to earthquakes, dust, toxins, noise, pressure, radiation, pollution, extreme heat, extreme cold, impacts, slashing, and piercing attacks. Moreover, this resistance surged exponentially as he neared death.

In addition to this, as Zhang Yu underwent the Living Stake Transformation, the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon also began to take effect on his body, gradually transforming his flesh, blood, and bones into temporary magical artifacts, further enhancing their strength.

All of this, built upon Zhang Yu's already formidable defensive capabilities, unleashed an astonishing surge of power.

Sensing his consciousness flickering precariously, as if about to extinguish, Zhang Yu's lips twitched, as if he wanted to smile but could no longer muster the strength.

He thought to himself: "In this arena, at this very moment..."

"I may not be the strongest living person."

"But I will at least be the strongest dead man, the toughest corpse..."

Kuang Tianqing's relentless assault unfolded in an instant. Almost as soon as she completed her barrage, Zhang Yu's final strike landed.

Fueled by the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, reinforced by the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon, and amplified by the original formation, the entire prison — its walls, armor, and even the tens of thousands of remaining flying swords and Sword Pills — transformed into countless colossal palms that crashed down upon Kuang Tianqing.

Zhang Yu murmured to himself, "This is my final strike..."

"Endless Martial Dao, devouring heaven and earth."

Countless colossal palms erupted, unleashing the full force of Zhang Yu's martial dao, converging to crush Kuang Tianqing.

Amidst thunderous, earth-shattering blows, Kuang Tianqing stood like a jagged reef relentlessly pounded and submerged by a tidal wave, enduring wave after wave of devastation.

At this critical moment, even as Kuang Tianqing unleashed a furious counterattack, Zhang Yu's final strike relentlessly devoured her.

In the dying seconds of their clash, the livestream's viewership skyrocketed, drawing nearly all spectators of the Ten Greats League.

In the Civil Engineering Department office at Myriad Laws University, Director Gao roared, "Damn it, hold on!"

The Soul Cultivation Old Director, now Assistant Director, couldn't help but mutter, "I told you Intelligent Construction had potential. Hang in there, Zhang Yu!"

Director Lin, also watching the broadcast, unconsciously held his breath and suppressed his breathing technique. "He's blocking it... he might actually block it..."

At the construction site, Xiao Qingxuan had stopped working, his gaze fixed on the Bionic Eye screen where Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing were locked in a frenzied clash. He murmured, "Don't lose to the Heavenly Demon's people."

Yu Xinghan also paused his work, his eyes glued to the livestream. "Old man, are you watching? Zhang Yu's about to go viral."

As he watched the massive structures surge within the live feed, he mentally roared, "Swallow her! Zhang Yu!"

Shi Huaiyu: "Swallow her!"

Ying Xin: "Grandpa, swallow her with Zhang Yu!"

Shi Yunxiang: "Steal all her spotlight!"

Le Mulan: "Zhang Yu, ruthlessly devour those who humiliated you..."

Even on the battlefield itself, as Zhang Yu's combat footage continued to stream to his teammates from the four schools, the fighting seemed to halt for a moment, all eyes turning to witness the outcome of this battle.

Excitement flashed in Yan Qianji's eyes. "Kuang Tianqing... she can't seem to break through Zhang Yu's corpse."

"How did he reinforce his corpse to this extent? Is the Civil Engineering Department's Living Stake Method truly this remarkable?"

"What a remarkably tough corpse," Nine Heavens Liu thought, his eyes gleaming with a sudden urge. "I want to buy it!" He wanted to acquire Zhang Yu's corpse.

Simultaneously, a pang of regret struck him. "Damn it, there's no connection to the outside Spirit Realm... I can't buy Civil Engineering stocks now."

Meanwhile, Ye Xingli's eyes widened in shock as she murmured to herself, "She's retreating."

"Kuang Tianqing is fleeing!"

"Fleeing from Zhang Yu for the second time... if that's really happening..."

A premonition surged through Ye Xingli's mind. From this moment forward, their fates were about to undergo a monumental shift.

At the same moment, Kuang Tianqing had to confront an undeniable truth.

She... indeed had to retreat.

For the second time, when facing Zhang Yu... she had to withdraw.

The mere thought of it ignited a blaze of fury within her.

But what had made Kuang Tianqing the strongest student at Heavenly Demon University was her ability to prevent anger from clouding her judgment.

She knew she had to admit it: she couldn't shatter the corpse before her.

At least, not before the surrounding structures completely closed in, swallowing her whole.

"We must retreat..."

Sensing the walls and armor closing in from all directions under Zhang Yu's final strike, about to completely swallow her whole, Kuang Tianqing snorted coldly in defiance. She violently blasted away the approaching giant palm, seizing her last chance to soar skyward and escape this place.

"There's no need to quarrel with a dead man."

At that moment, the collapsing structure had narrowed to a mere slit in the sky, like a well's mouth suspended high above Kuang Tianqing.

Thunder rumbled ominously.

Unbeknownst to her, the sky had been blanketed by layers of dark clouds, transforming into a black abyss that shrouded the entire battlefield.

Streaks of lightning, like thunder dragons, tore through this black abyss, their blinding, thousand-zhang thunderous light illuminating the entire battlefield.

And at the center of this thunder dragon procession, Dao Qiankun stood encased in armor crackling with lightning, resembling a sovereign commanding the celestial thunder, coldly surveying the battlefield below.

In his mind flashed the coordinates Zhang Yu had transmitted before his death — the very location of the final gap in the collapsing structure.

By attacking this precise location, Dao Qiankun could completely cut off Kuang Tianqing's retreat while unleashing an unavoidable strike that she could only meet head-on.

"Well done, Zhang Yu."

"You deserve commendation for enduring until this moment."

"Now, let me finish this."
