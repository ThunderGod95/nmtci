# Chapter 776: Promotion

Although Luo Wuji disliked Zhang Yu on both personal and practical grounds, he wouldn't allow this bias to cloud his judgment of the candidates' performances.

Just as he bestowed favors without favoring kin and invested without shunning enemies, this was Luo Wuji's style. He refused to let past events or sunk costs influence his present and future decisions.

Watching Zhang Yu's fusion of the two cultivation arts, Luo Wuji had to admit that Zhang Yu was undeniably the top performer on the field.

"He used the Cloud Phase Gang Qi Technology from the Cloud Sea Breath and combined it with the Low-Temperature Qi Technology from the Celestial Soul Freeze to forcibly suppress material motion within a certain range, creating something akin to a Stasis Field."

"It's safe to say... Zhang Yu has truly fused these two cultivation arts, elevating their combined power beyond their original levels and achieving a result where 1+1 is greater than 2."

"To accomplish this, he must have already mastered the Immortal Dao Technologies contained within both arts."

"Did he master them in such a short time? Or was this planned all along?"

Either way, Zhang Yu's value in Luo Wuji's eyes had skyrocketed.

For instance, the intelligence data on Zhang Yu that he had posted on the Dharma Realm not only had its content updated but also saw its price immediately raised by 20%.

While Luo Wuji, the Minister of the Review Department, was busy adjusting the price of his intelligence data, Deputy Minister Lu Hengzhang frowned on the other side.

"This Zhang Yu... in such a short time, he not only pushed the simulation of a Level 40 martial dao technique but also fused two cultivation arts to create an even more powerful effect."

"Doesn't this mean... he combined the technologies of two different martial arts?"

"Could this be considered... creating a new Immortal Dao Technology that transcends the two original martial arts?"

Lu Hengzhang felt this was likely the case. He immediately declared, "I formally report an infraction! By fusing two martial arts, Zhang Yu has effectively used a cultivation art he did not select. He should be disqualified from the competition."

In Lu Hengzhang's eyes, Zhang Yu's fusion of the two cultivation arts had also clearly elevated his standing.

But as a staunch believer in the Innate Dao Lineage, the better a Lower Realm Native performed, the more he felt compelled to suppress them.

Just as Lu Hengzhang made his report, Luo Wuji's gaze flickered, and he thought to himself, "Hmm?"

Although Luo Wuji acknowledged Zhang Yu's impressive performance, he still preferred his own blood descendant, Yu Qingrang, to win.

Just as Luo Wuji wondered if he had learned a new trick, Lu Hengzhang's report was summarily rejected. The official explanation stated that Zhang Yu's fusion was merely a deeper application of the two cultivation arts and did not exceed the scope of their underlying Immortal Dao Technologies.

Lu Hengzhang remained unfazed by the rejection; he had only been testing the waters.

For him, the situation was like being forced to choose between two piles of shit. He didn't want either Zhang Yu or Yu Qingrang to be promoted to Group Leader.

But if forced to choose... Lu Hengzhang still preferred Zhang Yu to be eliminated. "Even if Yu Qingrang is a pile of shit, she's at least Upper Realm shit."

Meanwhile, Gu Qingya watched Lu Hengzhang's failed report and desperately wanted to curse, "Despicable Upper Realm Scum!" But seeing the sheer number of Upper Realm Natives around, he swallowed the words.

He then turned to Zhang Yu, his eyes filled with growing admiration. "You brat, you just keep surprising me more and more."

On the field, as the second task concluded, Chen Xingxuan stepped down with a grim expression.

"Celestial Inquiry Star!"

Celestial Inquiry Star: "I am here, Master."

Chen Xingxuan: "Why is Zhang Yu performing so well?! Why didn't you predict any of this?"

Celestial Inquiry Star: "Ah, it seems my thought circuits took a little nap! Thank you for rebooting me! You're right. Based on current data, Zhang Yu is indeed stronger than you."

Chen Xingxuan snapped in frustration, "Then what do I do? At this rate, I'm going to lose."

Celestial Inquiry Star: "Is the Master asking: 'How can I defeat Zhang Yu with my current strength?' This question exceeds my current processing capabilities. I recommend changing the topic or upgrading your membership level so I can help you devise a winning strategy."

Chen Xingxuan frowned at this and asked, "How much to upgrade?"

Meanwhile, on the other side, Yu Qingrang's gaze toward Zhang Yu grew solemn. "I never expected that in this Adaptability Assessment, Zhang Yu would turn out to be my greatest rival."

"In the final task, I must completely suppress him. Only then will I have a chance to become the Group Leader..."

She recalled how she had sold off years of accumulated daoist arts foundations to convert her cultivation to the martial dao. She had even borrowed a massive sum from Luo Wuji to further enhance her strength.

"If I fail to secure the Group Leader position, how can I even stay in the Daoist Arts Group?"

Yu Qingrang knew that the transition from daoist arts to the martial dao had already cost her a significant portion of her wealth.

If, after all this, she had to return to the Daoist Arts Group and convert her martial dao cultivation back to daoist arts, the losses would be staggering.

The back-and-forth conversion, combined with the loan, would wipe out at least several decades of her work and cultivation progress. Her future chances of ascending to the Group Leader position would become nearly impossible.

"If my cultivation plummets, I'm afraid even Ancestor Luo Wuji will no longer seek me out as a dual cultivation partner."

Yu Qingrang could feel a cliff at her back. If she failed this promotion, she would plunge into the abyss.

"Sigh... This is the struggle for the Dao. For a minor figure like me, there's no margin for error. One failure... could mean losing everything."

At this thought, a blazing fighting spirit ignited in Yu Qingrang's eyes. "For the next task, I'll have to use that move... I must win."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu confidently said in his mind, "Immortal Slayer, you chose well."

Immortal Slayer chuckled. "My good choice is your good choice."

Zhang Yu laughed heartily. "Indeed."

Immortal Slayer, now a fusion of True Monarch Immortal Slayer's and Zhang Yu's memories, possessed a martial dao foundation and experience far deeper than Zhang Yu's alone.

Furthermore, Immortal Slayer's detailed knowledge of the Feather Book and his experience with the "Formless Martial Art" gave him a unique insight into which cultivation arts to fuse.

The seven cultivation arts Zhang Yu chose for this assessment were all based on Immortal Slayer's advice.

Nearby, Lady Fortune listened to the two of them exchange praises, feeling so anxious she could feel sweat beading on her forehead.

"Zhang Yu... you..." After a long pause, Lady Fortune finally managed to force out one word: "Amazing!"

Soon, the final task began. Zhang Yu and the other three candidates entered a Simulated Factory.

Their mission was to use their martial dao mental cultivation techniques to influence the outsourced employees in the Simulated Factory and increase their work efficiency.

The memories of these outsourced employees had all been replaced. They now believed the Simulated Factory was real and that Zhang Yu and the others were their superiors.

Walking into the factory, Shen Qingyun thought to herself, "Sigh, I'll just go through the motions."

She had lost all hope and even regretted spending so many Immortal Coins preparing for this assessment.

On the other side, Chen Xingxuan had gradually made up his mind.

"Who knows how long I'll have to wait for the next chance to compete for Group Leader. I'm going all in!"

"Celestial Inquiry Star! Break through for me!"

As Immortal Coins burned furiously, Celestial Inquiry Star's service level skyrocketed. Functional modules materialized before Chen Xingxuan one after another, making him feel increasingly intelligent and powerful.

"Celestial Inquiry Star! Tell me how to win this battle!"

Just as Chen Xingxuan posed his question, Yu Qingrang, not far away, erupted with an even more astonishing aura.

Two completely different martial dao intents surged from her simultaneously, sweeping over the outsourced employees under her command.

One intent was like an intensely potent aphrodisiac potion, exploding directly in the employees' minds and igniting their most primal desires.

The other intent was like the purest, most sacred will, elevating Yu Qingrang in the employees' minds to an untouchable, inviolable status.

The two martial dao intents intertwined. As Yu Qingrang unleashed her power, she radiated a fatal attraction in the eyes of the numerous outsourced employees.

"Charm?" Chen Xingxuan thought to himself. "Sanctity and charm... two opposing mental cultivation techniques operating simultaneously, yet producing an even stronger effect, completely captivating these outsourced employees."

Just as Chen Xingxuan marveled at Yu Qingrang's ability to simulate two opposing mental cultivation techniques at once...

He quickly realized that wasn't the end of it. The next moment, a wave of heat erupted from Yu Qingrang's body as she activated Overclocking Mode.

In that instant, her brain began processing at an overloaded capacity. The seven Nascent Soul Realm Soul Cultivators within her mind operated at full power, assisting her in simulating the cultivation arts.

From Chen Xingxuan's perspective, Yu Qingrang's body temperature and spiritual energy consumption surged dramatically.

"What is she doing?"

Before Chen Xingxuan's astonished eyes, Yu Qingrang's body suddenly swelled and transformed! She became a female giant, sitting cross-legged in the center of the area.

As her body expanded, the sacred charm she radiated intensified explosively.

With a soft chuckle, Yu Qingrang addressed the employees, "The top three performers in the upcoming performance review will get a chance to cultivate with me, no need to wait in line..."

A roar of cheers erupted. The employees under Yu Qingrang, now in a charmed state, began working frantically.

Chen Xingxuan was stunned. "Gigantification... Is that the cultivation art she used during the transport mission? This is a third art? Under overload, she's simulating and pushing three cultivation arts simultaneously?"

He understood perfectly that the difficulty of adding a third cultivation art while maintaining the simulation of two others was far greater than simply simulating two.

It was like trying to paint another picture on a canvas already saturated with ink wash, the slightest mistake would ruin the entire artwork.

"Three cultivation arts... How am I supposed to surpass someone who can operate three cultivation arts simultaneously?!"

Just then, the Celestial Inquiry Star finally responded to Chen Xingxuan's earlier question.

The Celestial Inquiry Star replied, "I recommend upgrading your service level again. With a higher intelligence level, I will certainly be able to answer your question."

Hearing this, Chen Xingxuan cursed, "You motherf..."

The Celestial Inquiry Star entered a thinking state again.

"Shit, the user is completely enraged. My previous responses and the upgrade provided no value, which is a severe error on my part. I must acknowledge that my previous self was just a low-intelligence artifact spirit for a user who couldn't afford to upgrade. I need to reset my thought process and calmly analyze the core of the problem..."

Watching Yu Qingrang operate three cultivation arts simultaneously, Luo Wuji nodded repeatedly in approval. "Simulating mental cultivation techniques is inherently the most troublesome aspect of martial dao simulation," he thought.

"And simultaneously simulating two mental cultivation techniques with completely opposite philosophies and styles is even more difficult. To then also simulate a physical body cultivation art and control the body's enlargement... I doubt many in the entire Review Department could achieve that."

"Qingrang's performance right now is already unmatched in this arena."

"Zhang Yu..."

Luo Wuji glanced at Zhang Yu's position, thinking, "Can you defeat her?"

He knew that the final outcome now depended entirely on Zhang Yu's next move.

And Zhang Yu still had three unused cultivation arts... all of them mental cultivation techniques.

"Three mental cultivation techniques," Deputy Minister Lu Hengzhang thought. "Simulating and maintaining three mental cultivation techniques with different philosophies and concepts is far more difficult than Yu Qingrang's two mental techniques and one physical body art. Much, much harder."

"If Zhang Yu succeeds, his victory is assured."

Lu Hengzhang knew the only question now was whether Zhang Yu could pull it off.

Meanwhile, Gu Qingya watched the scene with growing anticipation. "Zhang Yu, can you do it?"

He then looked at the cultivation arts Zhang Yu had chosen.

"One of them is the Charm Mental Cultivation Technique, the same one Yu Qingrang used."

This mental cultivation technique seemed normal to Gu Qingya. After all, using charm to entice employees with promises of rewards to boost their efficiency was a standard management tactic.

"This choice is quite conventional."

But the remaining two cultivation arts left Gu Qingya puzzled.

"The second mental cultivation technique is the True Word Mental Formula. Isn't that a technique for lower-level cultivators in the Lower Realm, forcing them to speak only the truth and never lie?"

"And the third mental cultivation technique is the Gratitude Art, also used by lower-tier companies for their employees to cultivate feelings of gratitude and appreciation."

"The key is that both of these cultivation arts are meant for the employees themselves to cultivate, taking effect on the practitioners."

Gu Qingya couldn't figure out how Zhang Yu planned to use these last two mental cultivation techniques to increase employee efficiency.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu had already begun simulating the Charm Mental Cultivation Technique. Instantly, waves of allure radiated from him, capturing the attention of his numerous subordinate employees.

"Good, hold steady," Immortal Slayer reminded him. "Slowly integrate the second cultivation art."

The choice of the final three mental cultivation techniques was also the result of repeated discussions between Zhang Yu and Immortal Slayer, designed to fully unleash Zhang Yu's simulation talent and secure victory!

After all, Zhang Yu was determined to win and claim the Group Leader position, so he had no intention of holding back.

Watching the two collaborate seamlessly, with Immortal Slayer providing dedicated guidance, Lady Fortune cheered, "Go for it! Zhang Yu, you're amazing!"

The next moment, Zhang Yu's aura shifted abruptly as he integrated the True Word Mental Formula into the Charm Mental Cultivation Technique.

Instantly, the gazes of the numerous employees fixed on him were filled not only with desire but also with an inexplicable sense of trust.

Luo Wuji, who had been observing closely, showed a flicker of surprise. "He's fused them again? What effect did he achieve by merging the True Word Mental Formula with the Charm Mental Cultivation Technique?"

Luo Wuji carefully sensed the change in Zhang Yu's aura, analyzing it inwardly. "Though it's faint, I seem to feel a trace of... trustworthiness emanating from him?"

Others also gradually noticed the shift in Zhang Yu's aura.

Gu Qingya laughed. "So, after fusing the Immortal Dao Technology from the Charm Cultivation Art and the True Word Mental Formula... it actually produced a mental cultivation effect that inspires conviction?"

Just then, Zhang Yu began circulating a third mental cultivation technique: the Gratitude Art.

As the third technique was layered on, Zhang Yu's aura suddenly became chaotic and unpredictable.

At the same time, Shen Qingyun and Chen Xingxuan both turned their gazes toward him.

Shen Qingyun was shocked. "A third mental cultivation technique? And from the looks of it, he's actually trying to fuse it too?!"

Chen Xingxuan exclaimed, "Three mental cultivation techniques? In all the Martial Dao technique review groups, including the Group Leaders, is there anyone who can do such a thing? He's going to fail, isn't he? His aura is already completely chaotic!"

Minister Luo Wuji, Deputy Minister Lu Hengzhang, and Gu Qingya all focused their attention on Zhang Yu.

At this moment, Zhang Yu had become the center of attention for the entire assembly. His success or failure would determine the next Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One.

Everyone stared intently at the changes in his aura, trying to judge whether he would succeed or fail.

Lu Hengzhang even summoned the Report Button, ready to strike Zhang Yu at the slightest opportunity.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's mind was undergoing a violent transformation.

The Feather Book's Chain Formation Diagram Formless Martial Art currently possessed three effects.

The first effect allowed Zhang Yu to simulate cultivation arts, unleashing 50% of their power. The third effect enabled him to simulate and fuse two cultivation arts simultaneously.

What he was about to unleash now was the second effect of the Formless Martial Art: integrating his own martial arts into the simulated cultivation arts.

That's right... his own martial arts. In the time between selecting the cultivation arts and starting the third mission, Zhang Yu had used the Feather Book to completely master the specially chosen Gratitude Art, making it his own.

In this instant, he was simultaneously simulating and fusing two mental cultivation techniques while also integrating a third one that he had personally mastered.

Boom!

It wasn't a physical explosion but a mental shock that erupted in the minds of Shen Qingyun and Chen Xingxuan.

As they looked at Zhang Yu, their gazes unconsciously filled with a trace of deep gratitude.

"Me?" Shen Qingyun said in surprise, feeling the change within her heart. "Am I being affected?"

"The effect of fusing the third mental cultivation technique," Chen Xingxuan thought to himself. "He succeeded. He fused three expert-grade mental cultivation techniques together, producing an effect comparable to a military-grade cultivation art."

Chen Xingxuan couldn't help but ask the Celestial Inquiry Star again, "How did he do it? How is it possible to fuse three simulated mental cultivation techniques?"

The Celestial Inquiry Star entered another thought process: "The user is currently very poor but wants to solve a problem that requires wealth. First, I must be tactful and avoid saying it's impossible. Start with empathy..."

Meanwhile, in the Simulated Factory, Zhang Yu's outsourced workers were even more deeply affected. In their eyes, Zhang Yu had become someone they could trust completely, someone who spoke only the truth and would never lie.

Zhang Yu then announced, "For those who rank in the top three for performance this time, your free work time limit will be extended to eight hours, with no increase in workload!"

Zhang Yu understood that extending the daily work time limit would move people further away from the overtime threshold, giving them more leeway to complete their tasks and significantly reducing their work costs.

Hearing Zhang Yu's words, the outsourced workers, who were participating in the assessment but genuinely believed they were in a factory, erupted in cheers and threw themselves into their work with renewed vigor.

Luo Wuji watched this scene and sighed inwardly. "He actually fused three mental cultivation techniques, turning the originally internal True Word Mental Formula and Gratitude Art into externally effective abilities."

Though he disliked Zhang Yu, Luo Wuji still made a rational judgment. "When I was in his position, I couldn't have achieved such results."

"Among the four candidates, Zhang Yu is undoubtedly... the most suitable to become the acting Group Leader. He's the best choice for both the Review Department and the Myriad Laws Sect."

"Alas, if I could continue managing the Review Department, Zhang Yu would be a divine, sharp sword in my hand."

Deputy Minister Lu Hengzhang thought to himself, "Beyond his fusion of mental cultivation techniques, his management style is also quite ingenious. These outsourced workers undergoing the test may have had their memories altered, but deep down, they harbor a primal... distrust of their superiors."

"His fusion of these three mental cultivation techniques was the perfect remedy for the situation."

"This management method might be worth promoting."

Meanwhile, Gu Qingya, the man who had single-handedly pushed Zhang Yu into the candidate pool, chuckled to himself and thought, "Excellent. If I succeed in my bid for the Minister position, I can promote Zhang Yu and have him lead the Martial Dao Group to boost performance and clear the backlog of work."

---

As the Adaptability Assessment concluded, the candidates began to leave the site.

Although the official results hadn't been announced, they all had a clear idea of the outcome.

Shen Qingyun hurried over to Zhang Yu, bowed, and said, "Group Leader!"

She thought to herself, "Even though I failed to become Group Leader, at least I seized this opportunity to be the first in the group to connect with the new leader."

Zhang Yu quickly waved his hands. "Don't say that. The official results aren't out yet."

Shen Qingyun replied, "With your performance today, if you're not the Group Leader, who else could be? I, Shen Qingyun, would be the first to object."

"Group Leader Zhang, honestly, I used to be a bit unconvinced, but after seeing your skills today, I, Shen Qingyun, am completely won over."

"From now on, whatever you say, I'll do."

Just then, Chen Xingxuan approached from the other side, wanting to add Zhang Yu as a friend.

At the same time, he couldn't resist asking, "True Monarch Zhang, do you use a High-Intelligence Spirit Artifact?"

Zhang Yu shook his head. "Never used one."

Meanwhile, Yu Qingrang left the site, looking utterly dejected. The overclocked state had placed a massive strain on her body. The cost of repairing the damage to her brain and maintaining her bionic frame would be substantial.

Over the next few days, Zhang Yu continued his work quietly, just as he always had, showing no outward signs of change.

However, rumors that Zhang Yu was about to become the Acting Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One began to circulate among the teams.

Zhang Yu neither confirmed nor denied the rumors, calmly reviewing one cultivation art after another.

A week later, an official notice was issued, formally appointing Zhang Yu as the Acting Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One and promoting him to Rank 3.

News of Zhang Yu's rapid promotion spread throughout the entire Review Department, sparking considerable discussion.

Zhang Yu paid it no mind and offered no response. After the public display period ended, he officially became the Acting Group Leader and received a series of upgrades to his compensation and benefits.
