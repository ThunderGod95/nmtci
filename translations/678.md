# Chapter 678: Victory and Defeat

Within the Dark Spirit Realm, a thunderous roar seemed to reverberate in the hearts of countless beings as the Lunar War livestream unfolded.

Zhang Yu looked up and faintly perceived streams of information from the third, fourth, and fifth layers of the Dark Spirit Realm converging here, as if they too were watching the Lunar War livestream.

"After the Second Layer's livestream, even the third, fourth, and fifth layers have begun watching this battle?"

He turned to glance at the daily quest floating beside him:

"Watch the Lunar War livestream for half an hour."

"Just like yesterday, it's still guiding users to watch the livestream."

Zhang Yu could already imagine how, with such fervent encouragement from the Righteous Qi Alliance, vast amounts of Qi Luck would inevitably converge upon Divine Monarch Chain Nexus, causing his power to surge to unimaginable heights.

Currently, it was the third day of the Lunar War.

In the Kunxu Second Layer, day and night no longer alternated. The sky blazed with the simultaneous radiance of the sun and moon, as if two suns had risen together, their incandescent light flooding the world.

The Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness and Long Night Jade Palace were constantly ablaze and erupting under the clash of the three Great Soul Transformation cultivators, unleashing earth-shattering shockwaves almost every moment. This caused widespread malfunctions in the Spirit Realm across various regions, with the network intermittently cutting off and then flooding with massive amounts of junk data.

Though Zhang Yu felt a sense of unease, he suppressed it, focusing his entire mind on his cultivation.

After completing his daily sign-in in the Dark Spirit Realm and exiting, he sat cross-legged in the underground tomb, continuously circulating his Golden Core Realm breathing technique, frantically absorbing the spiritual energy from the atmosphere.

Over the past two months, Zhang Yu had been diligently practicing the breathing technique, simultaneously advancing his Magic Power and leveling up ten Golden Core Realm breathing techniques to level 30, activating the "Boundless Magic Power" set in his Chain Formation Diagram.

Basic - Boundless Magic Power (6/6): Temporarily increases maximum Magic Power capacity by up to 10,000 units.

Advanced - Boundless Magic Power (8/8): Agitates spiritual energy during movement, restoring Magic Power. The faster the movement within a given time frame, the faster Magic Power is restored, up to the Golden Core Stage limit.

Ultimate - Boundless Magic Power (10/10): Seek Magic through Emptiness. The more depleted one's Magic Power, the greater the consumption, yet the more efficiently spiritual energy is absorbed, refined into Magic Power, and its quality enhanced, up to the Golden Core Stage limit.

It was precisely the completion of Boundless Magic Power that allowed Zhang Yu's Magic Power to surge steadily, reaching over 5,800 units.

At this moment, his Magic Power was nearly completely drained, continuously being expended.

The emptiness of his meridians, Dantian, and Golden Core transformed him into a black hole, frantically drawing in spiritual energy from his surroundings.

Suddenly, Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened as notifications flashed across his Bionic Eye.

"Exams, courses, internships, experiments... virtually all teaching-related activities have been suspended?"

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Almost everyone has been assigned military duties. Myriad Laws University City is now under maximum alert."

In the three days since the war began, Zhang Yu had been witnessing a steady stream of people logging in and out of the communication network. Names and avatars would suddenly turn grayscale, as if they had passed away.

Some of them may have been disconnected due to Spirit Realm malfunctions, while others had truly fallen in battle.

Even the debt number above Xiao Qingxuan's head kept fluctuating, now hovering around negative five thousand.

Zhang Yu knew this meant the cultivators and companies behind the debtors were constantly dying or going bankrupt.

"Since the war began, the Righteous Qi Alliance has been engaging in constant small-scale operations on all fronts. Many have been completely swayed by witnessing the battle livestreamed and have joined the Rebel Army, reigniting the chaos."

"In the past three days, not only has the Lunar War raged on, but covert struggles on the ground have intensified as well."

"If not for the Soul Transformation cultivators patrolling the realms, the turmoil would have spiraled out of control."

"And now, judging by the escalating alert levels..." Zhang Yu sighed, gazing at the rising threat level. "The intensity of the Lunar War is about to escalate again."

Lady Fortune remarked, "The Rebel Army leaders must be preparing to act. They won't simply stand by and watch the Sun and Moon of the Second Layer be so easily seized."

Zhang Yu lifted his head, his gaze piercing through layers of barriers to observe the clashing forces.

"Master..."

---

Above Myriad Laws University, bathed in the radiant glow of the sun and moon, True Monarch Azure Void sat cross-legged in mid-air, his hands forming a Dao Seal as if silently awaiting something.

In the next instant, his eyes snapped open, revealing two swirling black voids within them.

True Monarch Azure Void gazed upward, murmuring to himself, "They're here."

His gaze was fixed on the Kunxu Third Layer, now visible after the barrier between realms had shattered. Faint divine light flickered at the edge of the Third Layer, rising, descending, and piercing downward like divine swords connecting heaven and earth, plunging toward the Second Layer.

True Monarch Azure Void's eyes swept across the descending divine light, counting silently, "2... 8... 15... 21..."

As he observed, the number of enemy Soul Transformation cultivators continued to surge, threatening to tear apart the sky and earth.

Immediately, the Soul Transformation cultivators from the various universities, who had been on high alert, sprang into action. Their surging divine light collided in the sky, unleashing a cataclysmic chain reaction of hurricanes, earthquakes, and thunderous storms...

As the Soul Transformation cultivators clashed, faint figures began to emerge from the edges of the Third Layer.

Seeing these figures, True Monarch Azure Void's battle intent surged. He knew... these were his next opponents.

"Soul Transformation cultivators have their own battles," he thought to himself. "The primary focus of each university's Soul Transformation cultivators is to intercept their counterparts, preventing interference with the Lunar War or attacks on critical facilities that could weaken our war potential."

"With their full attention fixed on their Soul Transformation adversaries, wasting energy on Nascent Soul experts would diminish their chances of victory."

"Therefore, the Nascent Soul cultivators are our responsibility."

Watching the figures descend from the sky, hurtling toward Myriad Laws University, True Monarch Azure Void let out a long roar and charged forward to meet them.

"Come! This venerable one has been waiting for you!"

In the next instant, as the North Sea Star-Devouring Art activated, a pitch-black shadow, as dark as ink, completely enveloped the Myriad Laws University City.

Meanwhile, on the other side, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, the director of the Security Department, had already soared into the sky, reaching the edge of the Third Layer.

A voice echoed in True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's ear: "Well, according to the game's logic, you've stormed our spawn point, haven't you?"

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter glanced at his opponent and grinned. "A guy who can't even pass the Nascent Soul Certificate exam... You're too weak."

The opponent was about to retort when he suddenly found himself unable to speak.

Before he knew it, his head had been severed from his body, which he was now cradling against his chest.

In the next instant, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter turned his gaze to the other Nascent Soul True Monarchs descending from the Third Layer, a cruel smile playing on his lips. "My apologies, everyone. To prevent further damage to the university, I'm afraid you'll all have to die here."

As the intensity of the battle escalated, bizarre phenomena filled the sky.

In addition to the sun and moon erupting with blinding radiance, divine light bloomed across the heavens like countless exploding stars.

Massive numbers of Nascent Soul cultivators plummeted from the sky to the ground, resembling meteorites crashing to earth.

Simultaneously, the Lunar War on the Moon reached its critical moment.

---

"Chain Nexus, if you're still waiting for reinforcements, they've likely been intercepted," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole warned, her voice low. Heavenly Sun Radiance God had already clashed fiercely with his opponent.

Simultaneously, Divine Monarch Greenwood slammed his palm against the lunar surface beneath his feet. The Long Night Jade Palace shuddered violently as torrents of pure, frigid, and profoundly yin magic power erupted forth, transforming into liquid moonlight that surged across the battlefield.

Watching this unfold, Divine Monarch Chain Nexus thought to himself, "The sustained burning has breached the Long Night Jade Palace's outer shell, allowing them to finally reach the Moon's interior and begin vying for control of this magical artifact? No... that's not all..."

Staring intently at Divine Monarch Greenwood, Chain Nexus demanded, "You've activated the Moon's formation?"

The colossal magical artifact, ceaselessly rotating day and night to power the Spirit Realm Network that spanned the entire realm, naturally had a formation embedded within it.

Divine Monarch Greenwood still vividly remembered the awe he felt decades ago when he first saw the formation diagram during the Moon's construction.

"Immortal Sect Formation... the Great Yin Moonlit Citadel-Suppressing Formation."

Divine Monarch Greenwood sighed, "Old Friend, this is the first time you've truly unleashed your full power since your creation, isn't it?"

Intense lunar radiance erupted, threatening to freeze everything on the Moon — spiritual energy, atmosphere, Magic Power, flames... everything.

Simultaneously, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God continued its relentless pursuit of Divine Monarch Chain Nexus, burning fiercely.

Yin and yang, cold and heat — two extreme forces converged to crush Divine Monarch Chain Nexus.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said coldly, "Chain Nexus, no one can save you now. You've already lost."

Watching this unfold, Divine Monarch Chain Nexus remarked, "So this is your trump card?"

"Waiting for the other Soul Transformation cultivators to engage in battle, confirming there would be no further reinforcements from above, and then activating this killing move to secure your victory... you've certainly been meticulous."

"But..." Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's gaze sharpened. "Haven't I been waiting for this moment as well? Waiting for this great battle to reach a point where no one would interfere?"

Divine light surged from Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's body. In the next instant, his form seemed to dissolve into a phantom, drifting rapidly away from the battlefield.

"Hmm?" Divine Monarch Greenwood's heart jolted as he witnessed the scene. He sensed that Chain Nexus had broken free from spatial constraints, piercing through the Moon's outer spatial blockade and preparing to escape.

In that instant, Greenwood and Magnetic Pole simultaneously cried out, "Immortal Sect Technique! It's the one the Immortal left them, a technique containing spatial technology!"

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus chuckled softly. "Since I established this spatial blockade, I can naturally bypass it."

"And the Moon... will become your tomb."

As he spoke, Chain Nexus retreated rapidly while simultaneously forming Dao Seals, initiating the sealing of the Moon's outer perimeter.

But at that moment, Divine Monarch Greenwood roared, unleashing the full power of his Soul Transformation-level Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, lunging toward Chain Nexus.

As space warped, Chain Nexus's speed visibly slowed.

Yet Chain Nexus merely paused momentarily before continuing his relentless drift outward.

"Futile, Greenwood. Through our repeated clashes, I've thoroughly deciphered your cultivation. This meager force may hinder me slightly, but it cannot stop me..."

Just as Chain Nexus gloated, Magnetic Pole's voice rang out.

"What if I join in?"

With a wave of her hand, Magnetic Pole unleashed a terrifying Earthly Fiend Gravity from the crystal in her palm.

"Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power?" Divine Monarch Chain Nexus exclaimed, his heart pounding. "You used Joyful Union University's technology to store Greenwood's power in a synthetic Bionic beforehand..."

Under the intense gravitational pull, the space around Chain Nexus twisted violently, his retreat slowing to a crawl.

Simultaneously, yin and yang energies converged, relentlessly eroding his physical form.

Outside, the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness continued its relentless assault, gradually sealing off his escape route.

"Two madmen..." Chain Nexus snarled. "Release me! Do you want to die together?!"

Divine Monarch Greenwood roared, "Chain Nexus, do you think you can still retreat? There's no escape left! Today, either you die or I perish!"

The Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda descended with a thunderous crash. Magnetic Pole declared coldly, "Whether it's your physical body or your soul, you won't take either with you today."

Auspicious God's voice echoed from the depths of the Dark Spirit Realm: "Not if I have anything to say about it."

By the fourth day of the Lunar War, the battlefield had engulfed nearly the entire Second Layer.

On the Moon, the three factions fought with desperate ferocity, battling to the bitter end.

---

Meanwhile, deep beneath University City, Zhang Yu remained oblivious to the fierce battles raging above, fully immersed in his cultivation.

With each breath, dense spiritual energy surged into his body, circulating through his Dantian and Golden Core before being refined into drops of Magic Power.

The moment this Magic Power was created, he channeled it to his chest and abdomen, using it to open the Extraordinary Meridians.

For the past two months, aside from his daily breathing technique practice, Zhang Yu had been continuously expending Magic Power to open these meridians.

As a Golden Core Realm cultivator, one could typically open at least eight Extraordinary Meridians.

However, with the combined blessings of his Purple Mansion Golden Core and Golden Core Sacred Body, Zhang Yu could open a full ten. Such a feat was exceedingly rare, but fortunately, he had acquired a meridian refinement technique from Celestial Monsters University last month to aid his cultivation.

This technique was called Cosmic Annihilation.

The meridian refinement methods recorded in Cosmic Annihilation allowed for the opening of Extraordinary Meridians in different locations throughout the body, depending on the cultivation art being enhanced.

The cultivation art Zhang Yu intended to enhance after opening the meridians was naturally his highest-level technique, Kunlun in the Palm.

Thus, all the Extraordinary Meridians he opened revolved around Kunlun in the Palm.

With each Extraordinary Meridian he opened, Zhang Yu could feel the range of his Kunlun in the Palm technique expanding.

"Range... This is the direction in which Cosmic Annihilation enhances Kunlun in the Palm," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "Each time I open an Extraordinary Meridian, the spatial range I can manipulate with Kunlun in the Palm expands by over 10%."

"A month has passed, and I've already opened three Extraordinary Meridians."

"Once all ten Extraordinary Meridians are opened, the effective range of Kunlun in the Palm will likely double..."

Zhang Yu mused, "With this, combined with the Immortal Descendant's abilities, my Kunlun in the Palm will provide a much larger defensive area. I'll be able to protect more people and shield them behind me in times of crisis, won't I?"

Meanwhile, Lady Fortune watched Zhang Yu's cultivation process, thinking to herself, "Excellent, excellent. As Zhang Yu opens more Extraordinary Meridians, he'll be able to seize even more with a single move."

"In the future, we'll plunder wildly! Seize everything! Madly snatch the entire world!"

Just as Zhang Yu was fully focused on his cultivation, a glaring notification flashed across his Bionic Eye.

Zhang Pianpian: Junior Brother, we lost the Lunar War.

Zhang Pianpian: We might need to evacuate soon. Prepare yourself.

Zhang Yu's heart sank as he read the message. He immediately connected to the Spirit Realm and scoured for news about the Lunar War, but found nothing.

His heart grew heavier. "That's right," he thought. "If the Lunar War truly ended in defeat, they would likely suppress the news. It would be difficult to find anything in the Spirit Realm."

He immediately logged into the Dark Spirit Realm and was instantly overwhelmed by an atmosphere of jubilation.

Fireworks of information surged skyward, broadcasting the joyous news across the entire Dark Spirit Realm.

"Major Victory in the Lunar War! Magnetic Pole and Greenwood forces routed!"

"Divine Monarch Chain Nexus has completely seized control of Long Night Jade Palace and Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness! The Kunxu Second Layer will be under the Dark Spirit Realm's influence for the next 24 hours!"

"The major factions of the Third Layer are surrendering en masse! Unifying the Kunxu Third Layer is within reach!"

As Zhang Yu read each message, his heart sank further. "Have we truly lost?"

In the following days, no official news emerged from either the Spirit Realm or University City. The city remained under constant lockdown.

Meanwhile, rumors spread like wildfire, plunging University City into chaos and panic.

---

In the Spirit Realm Conference Room, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, Divine Monarch Cloud Haven, and Divine Monarch Tranquility sat in meditation at the head of the table, while a group of Nascent Soul True Monarchs stood silently below.

"After the Lunar War, the enemy Soul Transformation cultivators withdrew, leaving only Divine Monarch Chain Nexus to guard the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness..."

"The Long Night Jade Palace has been completely destroyed..."

"The Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness currently hangs high in the mid-heaven, visible for 24 hours a day. Rebel Army cultivators and Evil Gods are modifying it, and it's likely that before long, the Dark Spirit Realm and various viruses will begin radiating continuously throughout the Second Layer..."

"According to celestial records, over half of the Third Layer has already been occupied by the Rebel Army, and mass surrenders are underway..."

"Morale is wavering in several recaptured campuses, requiring further reinforcements..."

As each piece of news was revealed and decisions were made, the atmosphere in the room grew increasingly somber.

At that moment, a Nascent Soul True Monarch stepped forward and said, "With resources running low, we should tighten the expenditures of Golden Core cultivators as well..."

When he cited examples of Golden Core True Persons, Zhang Yu's data was conspicuously included. True Monarch Thunder Pole immediately recognized this as an attack aimed at his senior sister, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

"On the surface, they're targeting Zhang Yu's resources, but this is really an attack on us."

True Monarch Thunder Pole understood... As the main force in the war, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole would inevitably face criticism from all sides after this defeat, regardless of the circumstances.

Although the other two Soul Transformation cultivators had been promoted by Magnetic Pole, their interests would inevitably diverge after reaching Soul Transformation.

"There's no such thing as an unbreakable alliance... Once everyone becomes 'one of us,' internal divisions are bound to emerge."

"If we face further defeats and resource depletion, these conflicts will only intensify."

True Monarch Thunder Pole sighed inwardly. "With Greenwood severely injured and my senior sister defeated, the other two Soul Transformation cultivators will undoubtedly seek to seize more power and resources."

"Many might argue that since Senior Sister and Greenwood, who consumed so many resources, have failed, it's only natural for them to cede more resources to the other two Soul Transformation cultivators as the losers."

"As Soul Transformation cultivators themselves, they naturally want to secure more resources for themselves and their factions amidst this deteriorating situation, to prepare for the future."

Looking at the projected data, True Monarch Thunder Pole couldn't help but marvel at Zhang Yu's cultivation expenses, which far exceeded those of his peers and rivaled even the costs for some Nascent Soul True Monarchs. "Over eight months, he's burned through several thousand Spirit Coins... No wonder he's become a target, used as a pretext for this attack."

"Zhang Yu, you're spending way too much on cultivation!"

---

As the internal strife within Myriad Laws University intensified, Zhang Yu gradually sensed the undercurrents flowing down from the upper echelons, as well as the economic repercussions of the recent defeat.

First, nearly all off-campus projects were halted after the defeat, bringing most of the company to a standstill and causing Zhang Yu's income to plummet.

Next, prices soared, sharply increasing his daily expenses.

Then, Zhang Yu noticed that the quantity of resources he could purchase dwindled day by day, hindering his cultivation progress.

Since the Lunar War defeat, Zhang Yu felt as if invisible ropes were tightening around him, growing tighter and tighter, increasingly restricting his movements.

"The defeat has only worsened Myriad Laws University's already dire economic situation," Zhang Yu thought grimly. "Master's authority has also diminished."

In just a few days, Zhang Yu could sense that his words carried less weight than before. It seemed more cultivators were aligning themselves with Divine Monarch Tranquility and Divine Monarch Cloud Haven.

Zhang Yu examined his cultivation progress over the past few days. His Magic Power had officially surpassed 6,000 units today.

"If things continue like this, forget about future Nascent Soul cultivation; even attempting a Nascent Soul Breakthrough will become increasingly difficult."

"Unless we can secure a major victory, reclaim the Sun, restore order to the Second Layer, and boost the morale of all the universities."

As Zhang Yu pondered these thoughts, Divine Monarch Greenwood's communication request arrived.

"Zhang Yu," Divine Monarch Greenwood said, looking at his disciple. "Pack your things and prepare to leave University City."

Zhang Yu was taken aback. "Master! Has it... really come to this?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood sighed inwardly. "The Third Layer will fall soon. When the Rebel Army attacks the Second Layer, Myriad Laws University will likely be their first target."

"I want you to be prepared."

"You carry Kunlun in the Palm, your future potential is boundless. But your current cultivation level is too low to remain here safely."

"Zhang Yu, survive..."

At that moment, Zhang Yu looked at his teacher and asked earnestly, "Master, why did we lose the Lunar War? Is there... truly no hope left?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood paused, then sighed. "Divine Monarch Chain Nexus had the support of layers upon layers of resources for his cultivation, the infusion of Qi Luck, and the aid of an Evil God. His strength was extraordinary. To everyone else... his victory might seem inevitable."

"But I know... in the Lunar War, Magnetic Pole didn't lose. It was me... I was the one who lost to Chain Nexus..."

"We fought Chain Nexus to the very brink. If we had continued our assault, we had a ninety percent chance of annihilating him."

"Yet throughout the battle, Chain Nexus relentlessly focused his attacks on me, manipulating space to seal me off and channeling the battle's aftershocks directly toward me."

"If we had continued fighting, Magnetic Pole could have slain Chain Nexus, but I would have likely died..."

His eyes flickered with light and shadow, as if reliving the battle. He recalled Magnetic Pole's retreat, and Chain Nexus's chilling laughter echoing after them.

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus: "Magnetic Pole, you elevated Greenwood to Soul Transformation instead of a stronger candidate, prioritizing sentiment over profit. That was your downfall."

"Your attempt to defeat me through alliance was also your downfall."

"And placing your hopes in others? That sealed your defeat."

"The path of the Immortal Dao is about sacrificing the world to benefit oneself..."

Divine Monarch Greenwood snapped out of his reverie, his eyes growing even more bitter. He sighed deeply before continuing, "To save my life, Magnetic Pole accepted defeat in that battle."

"Enough of this. Just follow my plan and prepare to withdraw. Before you leave, think carefully about who you want to take with you..."

Zhang Yu suddenly asked, "Teacher, I heard that the Lunar War was lost because we couldn't break through their spatial blockade. Is that true?"

"Don't let your mind wander," Divine Monarch Greenwood replied. "This matter has nothing to do with you."

"Teacher, I..." Zhang Yu began, opening his mouth to speak, but no words came. He watched as Divine Monarch Greenwood's figure vanished into the distance.

Lady Fortune exclaimed, "Zhang Yu, what are you planning? You wouldn't reveal your trump cards to them, would you?"

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Lady Fortune, if we retreat now, will we truly have another chance?"

"If Myriad Laws is completely defeated, and the Righteous Qi Alliance consolidates all forces from the second to fifth layers, we'll have no resources, no connections, and no hope of advancing our cultivation. Can we really keep hiding forever?"

"Even if we manage to hide and wait for the Heavenly Court to descend and decide everything... is the outcome guaranteed to be favorable?"

Zhang Yu's mind filled with familiar faces as the Righteous Qi Alliance swept across the land: his teacher, his closest friends, his comrades... How many would be crushed to dust?

Lady Fortune frowned slightly. She had instinctively wanted Zhang Yu to keep his trump card hidden.

But hearing his words, she couldn't help but think about the future. "You have a point," she thought, "but what can you do? With your current cultivation, how can you possibly fight the Righteous Qi Alliance or a Soul Transformation cultivator?"

"I know there are Evil Gods lurking above, eager to devour us. But we lack the power to even reach them."

Zhang Yu said, "I can't fight them directly, but my teacher and the others can.

"And if they could harness my Spatial Power, they might be able to break through the spatial blockade and gain a decisive advantage in battle."

Lady Fortune's heart jolted. "You're proposing to reveal your trump card? No... it's too dangerous."

In her eyes, even Greenwood and Magnetic Pole were far less trustworthy than herself. How could Zhang Yu so easily expose his hidden strength?

---

In the bedroom, Yu Xinghan was taking his medicine.

Noticing Zhang Yu's silence beside him, Yu Xinghan asked, "What's wrong?"

Zhang Yu asked, "Yu Xinghan, if it were you, would you choose to stay and fight or evacuate?"

Yu Xinghan paused, then sat down with a smile. "If I had to choose, I'd stay."

"Myriad Laws University has too much that can't be taken away. If we just abandon it, how long can we survive as fugitives?"

Zhang Yu turned to Le Mulan. "Le Mulan, what do you think?"

"Whether you choose to stay or evacuate, I'll support you," Le Mulan replied.

In the company group chat, Zhang Yu posed the same question.

Shi Huaiyu replied, "Fuck that! If it were up to me, I'd fight the Righteous Qi Alliance to the bitter end! Everything's free there — how the hell are we supposed to make money? What about my investments here? What about the new burial plot I just bought?"

Xiao Qingxuan added, "The Evil Gods and Demonic Sect rely on brainwashing to control their followers. I'd rather fight to the last breath than become their puppets."

Ying Xin: "Our family has struggled for six generations to establish roots in Myriad Laws. All my assets are here, and I have no intention of fleeing."

Zhao Tianxing: "Zhang Yu, I'll follow your lead. If you retreat, I'll go with you. I can even live inside your sword if necessary."

As Zhang Yu read the replies from his companions, his gaze swept across the countless messages in the Spirit Realm. He sensed a palpable surge of battle intent and fighting spirit rising from many within Myriad Laws University.

He felt a surprising sense of unity emerging within University City.

Soon after, he returned to the Dark Spirit Realm.

Observing the changes within the Dark Spirit Realm, Lady Fortune remarked, "Hey, we haven't even taken the Second Layer yet, and these damn merchants are already raising prices."

"These bastards are just itching to exploit the world."

Zhang Yu ignored her complaints and purchased intelligence reports to assess the situation across the Second Layer's universities. He saw endless chaos, slaughter, and destruction...

After prolonged contemplation, Zhang Yu sent a communication request to Director Gao the next day. "Teacher, I need to discuss something with you."

"My battle with Dao Qiankun gave me a profound understanding of Space."

"For the past eight months, I've been constantly studying and repeatedly simulating the Immortal Sect Technique in my mind... Finally, I've grasped something... a method to disrupt spatial structures using Kunlun in the Palm."

Half an hour later, after confirming the power within Zhang Yu, Divine Monarch Greenwood took a deep breath, barely suppressing his shock and awe.

He thought to himself, "A prodigy... a true peerless genius..."

After a long silence, he slowly exhaled. "Zhang Yu, have you told anyone else about this power besides me?"

Seeing Zhang Yu shake his head, Divine Monarch Greenwood continued, "Zhang Yu, this ability of yours is truly crucial. With it, Magnetic Pole can definitely defeat Chain Nexus, reclaim the Sun, and reverse the current situation."

Before Zhang Yu could reply, Divine Monarch Greenwood added, "Zhang Yu, I want to thank you for your trust."

"Magnetic Pole and I will keep this secret safe for you."

He said solemnly, "Rest assured, unless I die, I will never let anyone harm you."
