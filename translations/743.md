# Chapter 743: Sect Positions

After Zhang Pianpian left the Supreme Clarity Realm, Zhang Yu first retrieved the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture and Heaven and Earth Are My Sword from the Soul-Guiding Pool, then committed the contents of both arts to memory.

"This way," he thought, "counting Kunlun in the Palm and the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier, I now have four Immortal Sect Techniques."

"If I include the Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art, a black art suspected to be Immortal Sect-level, that makes five."

Zhang Yu then gave a wry smile. "Unfortunately, aside from Kunlun in the Palm, I don't have the license for any of the others."

"Is there any way to secure the license for these cultivation arts?" he wondered.

Shaking his head, Zhang Yu temporarily set the matter aside. After memorizing the two Immortal Sect Techniques, he exited the Supreme Clarity Realm and sent messages to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, Divine Monarch Greenwood, and True Monarch Starfire, inquiring about the Sect Staff Selection Examination and available positions within the sect.

The three teachers had yet to reply when Bai Zhenzhen, standing nearby, looked over curiously. "Yu Zi, what's wrong?"

As a master of the Seven Emotions Sword Dao and the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, Bai Zhenzhen could keenly sense shifts in others' emotions. At this moment, she detected an unprecedented fighting spirit radiating from Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu considered for a moment, then decided to tell Bai Zhenzhen about the Sect Staff Selection Examination. After all, she would find out sooner or later, and he desperately hoped she would take the exam with him so they could join the sect together.

"The Sect Staff Selection Examination?" Bai Zhenzhen was stunned by the news. "There's actually an opportunity like this?"

In that instant, Bai Zhenzhen understood why Zhang Yu was suddenly brimming with fighting spirit.

How to join a sect? This had always been a goal shrouded in mystery, a path with no clear direction.

But now... as Zhang Yu would put it, the boss's health bar had finally appeared.

Bai Zhenzhen understood. For students like them, who had clawed their way up from the very bottom step by step through studying, cultivating, and taking exams, tests were what they did best.

If they could compete for a chance to enter a sect through a selection process with clear standards — through an exam — Bai Zhenzhen also felt her own fighting spirit surge.

"Great!" she exclaimed excitedly. "If we can test our way into a sect, we'll never have to worry about unemployment again!"

"Teacher Seven Emotions once said that unless you commit some catastrophic mistake, you'll never be easily expelled from a sect. It's a place where you can earn a living for life, without ever fearing being eliminated."

Hearing Bai Zhenzhen's words, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "The fear of unemployment, the craving for a stable income... these are etched into the very bones of the Kunxu people. But... in today's Kunxu, does a truly stable, lifelong job even exist?"

The image of True Monarch Starfire gradually formed in his mind. "I wonder how Teacher Starfire ended up down here."

Zhang Yu recalled his experiences from the First Layer to the Fifth Layer. He felt that the entire Kunxu was like a great furnace, burning fiercely, constantly undergoing new transformations every moment. It was hurtling forward at a breakneck speed, and no one could remain untouched by its flames.

Of course, Zhang Yu still desperately longed to join a sect.

After all, the power of the ritual had been pushing him forward, compelling him to enter one.

Moreover, only by joining a sect could he gain more opportunities to learn Immortal Sect cultivation arts, become stronger and wealthier, and better control his own destiny.

And according to legend, only by joining one of the Ten Great Sects could one attain the chance to ascend and become an Immortal.

"Become an Immortal..."

Although Zhang Yu was only at the Nascent Soul Realm, a fierce determination surged within him. He wanted to become an Immortal, to climb to the very peak of Kunxu.

Just then, a notification flickered in his bionic eye. Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood had sent him an invitation to a Spirit Realm Conference.

Zhang Yu thought for a moment and decided to bring Bai Zhenzhen along. It would save him the trouble of explaining everything to her later.

Inside the Spirit Realm Conference Room.

Watching Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen arrive together, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sent a message to Divine Monarch Greenwood: "Your precious disciple never forgets to bring that Bai Zhenzhen along, no matter where he goes."

Divine Monarch Greenwood replied: "I think Little Bai is quite good. Especially that time she single-handedly rushed to support Zhang Yu with her sword, and together they defeated Immortal Slayer. That's not something an ordinary person could do."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: "I'm not saying she's bad. I just fear that what makes him may also be what breaks him."

Seeing Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's reply, Divine Monarch Greenwood fell silent.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had already greeted the two Divine Monarchs.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "Zhang Yu, we've read the message you sent. The reason we didn't reply immediately was partly because we were in the middle of a handover, and partly because we were gathering information about the sects."

Zhang Yu asked curiously, "A handover?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood explained, "This time, all the newly ascended Soul Transformation cultivators from the Ten Universities must attend a five-year training program at the sects. During this period, higher-ups will send down other Soul Transformation cultivators to oversee each university."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole continued, "We've completed the handover with the new Soul Transformation cultivators. For the time being, they will act as interim principals..."

Upon hearing this, Zhang Yu's heart stirred. A figure appeared in his mind, and he asked, "Among the new Soul Transformation cultivators, is there one named Yun Zhiguang?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "Oh? It seems she's already contacted you. That's right. Besides her, there's another Soul Transformation cultivator. Both are from the sects. For the next five years, they will oversee Myriad Laws University and be responsible for advancing the reconstruction efforts both inside and outside the university."

Divine Monarch Greenwood reminded him, "These sect disciples have extraordinary backgrounds and hold high positions. Remember, you must not offend them."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded. "You've already drawn enough attention during this University War. It's time to rein yourself in and focus on your own cultivation."

"Coincidentally, the Sect Staff Selection Examination is coming up. You should dedicate yourself to preparing for it."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's tone was complex as she continued, "If you can pass the exam and enter a sect, it will be like a carp leaping over the dragon gate. Only then will your path on the Immortal Dao truly become vast and promising."

Divine Monarch Greenwood sighed. "Entering a sect not only provides better cultivation conditions but also offers the chance for retirement."

Retirement? Hearing these words, Zhang Yu was stunned. Was such a concept even possible in Kunxu?

Divine Monarch Greenwood said, "It is said that within the sects, when a Void Refinement Realm cultivator reaches the last hundred years of their lifespan, they can cease participating in sect duties and still receive an annual cultivation stipend. It's truly like ascending to a leisurely immortal life, achieving great freedom."

As he spoke, Divine Monarch Greenwood's eyes filled with envy.

Zhang Yu was once again stunned. Such a good deal actually existed in Kunxu? But it was a privilege exclusive to high-realm sect disciples.

Divine Monarch Greenwood continued, "Beyond the Void Refinement Realm, it's said that with each higher realm you reach, the retirement period becomes even longer. Upon finally ascending to immortality, you never have to work again, supported jointly by the Heavenly Court and your sect."

"The higher the realm, the more free time and the larger the stipend, huh?" Zhang Yu cursed inwardly. "This is outrageous! The higher your realm, the more you should work and contribute to the sect! What's this nonsense about resting?"

But a moment later, he realized the truth. Given the typical nature of Kunxu people, these high-realm cultivators, after "retiring," probably just stopped working for the sect. They would likely still be working desperately to advance their own cultivation and amass personal wealth.

Beside them, Bai Zhenzhen grew increasingly excited upon hearing this. She sent a message to Zhang Yu: "Yu Zi! The sect's benefits are amazing! We have to break through to the Void Refinement Realm together in the future! We'll retire together for a hundred years! Getting paid every year without working — we'll finally be able to control our own time!"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole added, "Only within a sect can a Soul Transformation Cultivator break through to the Void Refinement Realm."

She looked at Zhang Yu and explained, "You're not a Soul Transformation Cultivator, so you wouldn't know. For cultivators at our realm to refine their spirit and return to the void — to break through to the next realm — we must reach the Fifteenth Layer of Kunxu."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed. "Only the Fifteenth Layer and above possess the necessary Immortal Dao elements for refining the spirit and returning to the void."

"If a Void Refinement Realm cultivator wishes to break through further, they must climb to even higher layers."

"For the subsequent realms, it's impossible to break through without reaching those higher layers."

Zhang Yu's heart sank. "So, the only way to reach higher realms is to join a sect and keep climbing layer by layer?"

Just then, Dao Qiankun came to mind. "I wonder if Brother Dao, after seizing the Sixth Layer, has found a way for Soul Transformation Cultivators to break through their realm restrictions there?"

As Zhang Yu pondered, Divine Monarch Greenwood continued, "The benefits of joining a sect are too numerous to count. Unfortunately, your Master and I no longer have the chance. You must seize this opportunity."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole added, "We asked the two newly arrived Soul Transformation Cultivators about the Sect Staff Selection Examination. The first thing you need to decide is which sect and which position you'll apply for."

"As for the sect, that's obvious. With your degree from Myriad Laws University, you'll have the greatest advantage applying to the Myriad Laws Sect. Don't even consider other sects."

Divine Monarch Greenwood reminded him, "It's July now. Zhang Yu, you're in your second year of graduate studies, right? You should apply for early graduation as soon as possible. If you can apply with a Master's degree, that will be another advantage."

"However, with the ongoing war these past two years, you've fallen behind on your graduate coursework, haven't you? You need to catch up quickly. Focus on getting your Master's diploma first — the sooner, the better."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole agreed. "I'll have True Monarch String Tone arrange things for you. You can complete all the required studies, exams, and thesis in one go."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole returned to the topic of the Sect Examination. "I heard from Yun Zhiguang and the others... This time, the Sect Staff Selection Examination will have openings in nearly every department — Halls, Pavilions, Palaces, Courts, all the factions will be recruiting."

"Even a core department like the Immortal Ascension Hall is hiring. If you get in, you'll have direct access to the Sect Leader, Vice Sect Leaders, and the Chiefs of every faction. It's a chance to ascend to the heavens in a single step."

Divine Monarch Greenwood, however, was unimpressed. "The competition for a place like that is too fierce. The sect disciples inside all have powerful backgrounds. Zhang Yu might struggle to get promoted for years."

"Besides, the sect's affairs are endlessly complex. I'm afraid if he joins, he'll be buried in administrative duties, doing all sorts of tedious and exhausting tasks, leaving no time for his own cultivation."

"And in a place like that, he'll be constantly watched by cultivators with vast Divine Powers. Every word and action will likely be strictly monitored and constrained. It's completely unsuitable for Zhang Yu."

At the same time, Divine Monarch Greenwood thought to himself, "And then there's the social etiquette of the sect's upper echelons... Zhang Yu would probably struggle to adapt. If he offends someone, he'll only bring disaster upon himself."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "I agree. Compared to those administrative departments, a role in Immortal Dao Technology would probably be a better fit for Zhang Yu."

"For example, the Heavenly Creation Pavilion is a good option. It specializes in puppet technology research. Zhang Yu, with your experience from the Heavenly Sun Radiance God and the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, and your artifact refinement talent — which is as impressive as mine was back in the day — you'd surely make rapid progress there."

"Or the Heaven And Earth Pavilion is also excellent. They specialize in Space Immortal Dao Technology. You've already achieved considerable skill with Kunlun in the Palm and have experience developing the Great Void Cloud Repository, giving you a significant advantage."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled. "If you can establish yourself in the sect through your artifact refinement skills, your weaker background won't matter. You can climb the ranks step by step, even if it's a bit slower."

Divine Monarch Greenwood nodded. "If you apply for positions in this field, the examination content should also be more suitable for you. Your professional background in the Artifact Refinement Department is a major advantage."

"Will my Civil Engineering background affect my chances in the Sect Examination?" Zhang Yu desperately wanted to ask, but after a moment's thought, he held his tongue.

"Forget it," he thought. "I'll ask someone else about this later."

After his conversation with Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood, Zhang Yu's interest in Immortal Dao Technology positions had indeed been piqued.

"With my talent and the Feather Book's assistance, I can master any cultivation art or technology incredibly quickly."

This had always been Zhang Yu's experience, especially now that he had mastered the Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art. The sixteen additional clones it granted him could further accelerate his learning and cultivation speed.

Of course, he couldn't openly use this art; he would have to employ it secretly to speed up his progress.

"Considering all this, making progress in Immortal Dao Technology shouldn't be difficult. Should I really choose a position in this field?"

Beside him, Bai Zhenzhen thought, "This won't do. Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood only have information about the Myriad Laws Sect. Am I supposed to take the Myriad Laws Sect's examination?"

She was certainly willing to enter the Myriad Laws Sect with Zhang Yu. In fact, if not for the unexpected incident in the First Layer that led her to enroll in Heavenly Sword University, she would have entered Myriad Laws University with him back then.

"Sigh, but I'm already an undergraduate and Master's student at Heavenly Sword University. It'll probably be very difficult to pass the Myriad Laws Sect's examination."

Bai Zhenzhen's mind raced, and a trace of worry unknowingly appeared in her eyes.

Just then, Zhang Yu spoke up. "True Monarch Starfire has replied. Let's go hear what he has to say."

---

Another Spirit Realm Conference Room had been prepared.

True Monarch Starfire took a deep breath, stretching his neck and swinging his arms with a sense of relief. "Finally," he thought, "I don't have to worry about running out of Spirit Realm Flow anymore."

Just then, three figures materialized before him in succession: Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen, and Yu Xinghan.

"You're all here?" True Monarch Starfire began. "In two months, registration for the Sect Staff Selection Examination will open. The examination itself will officially begin one month after that."

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's hearts tightened. "So soon?"

Yu Xinghan, standing beside them, looked bewildered. "Sect Staff Examination?"

True Monarch Starfire gave a brief explanation, concluding, "According to the information I've received, registration for this selection examination will be open to cultivators from the First to the Tenth Layers."

Yu Xinghan exclaimed in shock, "Even the First Layer?"

"Theoretically, yes," True Monarch Starfire replied. "But in practice... the requirements are Golden Core cultivators under 150 years old or Nascent Soul cultivators under 400 years old. No one in the First Layer should meet those criteria."

Yu Xinghan nodded slightly, then suddenly realized something. "Master, could it be... you can also register for this Sect Staff Selection Examination?"

True Monarch Starfire smiled. "That's right. I never thought I'd have the chance to return to the sect one day. This time, I'll be taking the Sect Examination alongside you."

"Back in the day," he reminisced, "I was fortunate enough to catch a benefactor's eye and transition from an outsourced position to a full member. I thought I'd escaped the ordeal of the Sect Examination for good."

"Who would have thought that after all this time, I'd have to go through it again?"

Shaking his head, True Monarch Starfire looked at his three students. "The first step in the Sect Examination is choosing a position. Do any of you have any ideas?"

When all three shook their heads, True Monarch Starfire wasn't surprised. He began to explain, "Broadly speaking, the Myriad Laws Sect is divided into two main career paths."

"One focuses on Immortal Dao Technology, while the other centers on General Management."

"Both paths offer opportunities for advancement and can lead to a promising future, but their focuses are different..."

As he watched his three students listen intently, True Monarch Starfire couldn't help but recall the days when he had mentored them back on the First Layer.

He never would have imagined that after just six or seven short years, they would meet again up here.

And this time, all four of them were examinees.

As Zhang Yu listened to True Monarch Starfire's explanation, he finally gained a vague understanding of the Myriad Laws Sect's internal structure. He immediately asked, "Teacher Starfire, which path do you think we should take?"

True Monarch Starfire replied, "General Management, of course."

Bai Zhenzhen looked surprised. "We have no connections up here, but our talent is quite good. Shouldn't we focus on Immortal Dao Technology?"

True Monarch Starfire scoffed. "Talent... You've cultivated for so long, yet you still believe in that nonsense? The most important thing for Immortal Dao Technology research is money. What's the use of talent alone?"

"Besides, can't talent be bought? There's almost nothing in the sect that money can't buy."

Sighing, True Monarch Starfire continued, "Moreover, the more advanced the Immortal Dao Technology research, the more secrets and copyrights are involved, making it easy for the sect to monitor you strictly."

"And once you're under surveillance, you might become research subjects yourselves."

"Moreover, many high-end Immortal Dao Technologies are inherently extremely dangerous. Mere contact could lead to irreversible consequences."

Listening to True Monarch Starfire, Zhang Yu and the other two immediately sensed the immense dangers lurking within Immortal Dao research.

True Monarch Starfire continued, "Within the General Management path, some positions require money, connections, and background. But there are also roles you can earn through sheer hard work."

Looking at the three, he explained, "Are you aware that the Sect War and the Righteous-Demonic Conflict are constantly ongoing up here?"

Yu Xinghan asked in surprise, "Are the conflicts between the Ten Great Sects really that intense? To the point where they're always at war?"

True Monarch Starfire shook his head. "It's not about conflict; it's about interests. Through events like the 'Sect War' and the 'Righteous-Demonic Conflict,' the sect not only stimulates the development of Immortal Dao Technology and consumes excess inventory, but also acquires certain Immortal Dao Elements they need. Beyond that, there are Killing Tribulations, Market Rescues, Merit, Heavenly Gang Qi, Earthly Fiend Qi..."

"To produce these various Immortal Dao Elements, the sect regularly and systematically manufactures all sorts of events."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's mind stirred, and he couldn't help but wonder: "Were the major events I've experienced in the past also manufactured to fulfill some kind of need?"

Meanwhile, True Monarch Starfire continued, "In short, the sect is full of these frontline positions. They're tied to the sect's various strategic plans and involved in producing all sorts of Immortal Dao Elements. You can accumulate merit quickly, and the base salary is exceptionally high. They're arguably the most suitable roles for people like us, who have neither money nor influence."

Yu Xinghan said, "But they sound incredibly dangerous. Isn't it easy to go bankrupt?"

True Monarch Starfire sighed. "If they weren't dangerous, would we even get a chance?"

"Don't think you're set for life just because you managed to pass the entrance exam."

"The sect is just as competitive and stressful. The income is high, but the expenses are even higher. Fall behind once, and you'll keep falling behind. Eventually, you won't even have the chance to quit."

Seeing the three lost in thought, True Monarch Starfire added, "Take what I've told you today to heart. If you have any questions about the sect, feel free to ask me anytime."

"Don't waste time. Decide on your application track as soon as possible. The exam content varies greatly between different positions. Once you've made your choice, I'll help you plan your preparations for the Sect Examination."

Yu Xinghan nodded repeatedly, thinking to himself that more details about the Sect Staff Examination would likely only be announced later by the Righteous Gods. Preparing a step ahead under True Monarch Starfire's guidance was a significant advantage.

True Monarch Starfire sighed. "Don't assume your current strength guarantees you'll pass this Sect Examination."

"From what I know, there's strong opposition within the sect to this Sect Staff Examination being offered to the lower levels. This exam won't be easy."

Not long after Zhang Yu and True Monarch Starfire finished their conversation, Yun Zhiguang appeared again.

Her projection materialized before Zhang Yu. "You want to take the Sect Examination?"

Seeing Zhang Yu nod, Yun Zhiguang smiled. "Guess how many years I spent trying to get into the sect?"

"Twelve years."

"The Sect Examination isn't that easy. Passing within a few years is a pipe dream, let alone when you only have three months."

"Moreover, the sect has already decided. For those of you from the Second to Fifth Layers... not a single one of you will pass this time."

Yun Zhiguang patted Zhang Yu's shoulder. "From now on, just stay at the University and help me run my company and promote the Dharma Realm."

"Work hard in this life, and in the next, I'll help you get reincarnated on the Eleventh Layer. You'll have a much better chance of passing the Sect Examination then. Once you're in the sect, I'll put in a good word for you. Maybe after a few more decades, you'll even climb to my position."
