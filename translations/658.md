# Chapter 658: Wealth and Honor Without Returning Home Are Like Wearing Brocade Clothes at Night

If anyone else had been invited by Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution, Zhang Yu could have easily brushed them off, listening half-heartedly and treating their words as mere intelligence to consider.

But facing Director Gao before him, Zhang Yu couldn't help but listen attentively and take his words seriously.

Zhang Yu smiled and said, "Teacher, I haven't fully decided on this matter yet. I'm glad you're here to offer your guidance."

Director Gao spoke solemnly, "Has Divine Monarch Seven Emotions explained the drawbacks of the Crimson Heart Sword Manual to you?"

Zhang Yu's heart stirred. While he had reservations about the Crimson Heart Sword Manual recommended by Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, Director Gao's grave demeanor surprised and piqued his curiosity.

Seeing Zhang Yu shake his head, Director Gao cut straight to the point: "The so-called 'pure and flawless, utterly genuine' nature of the Crimson Heart Sword Manual means acting entirely according to one's own personality and emotions."

"In the words of cultivators, it's akin to saying, 'Since I can't control my personality, let it control me,' or 'Trust your instincts and let them drive your Sword Dao to its fullest potential.'"

"When someone cultivates such a technique, they become increasingly guided by their instincts and personality. Not only do they lack flexibility, but even when faced with certain death, they refuse to change their resolve."

"If a world were filled with people like this... what do you think would happen?"

Zhang Yu felt a chill in his heart. "Endless conflict?" he asked.

Director Gao replied, "If too many people cultivated Immortal Dao Technology, it could indeed lead to widespread chaos. The resulting scenario is hard to imagine, but I doubt those in power would allow such a situation to develop."

"More likely, cultivators would be strictly controlled within certain limits. They'd be arrested for debts, bankruptcies, and other reasons, then refined into various magical artifacts — becoming tools for spiritual energy to manipulate matter, or simply high-quality energy sources."

"After all, using the Immortal Dao Technology from the Crimson Heart Sword Manual doesn't require personal cultivation."

Director Gao sighed. "Rather than cultivating oneself, it's far more efficient to make the poor cultivate, then refine them into tools and magical artifacts. This is likely to become the mainstream approach to technology dissemination."

"Once the Immortal Dao Technology from the Crimson Heart Sword Manual begins to spread, whoever becomes a Crimson Heart Child will be at a disadvantage, exploited, and ultimately devoured."

"Therefore, the dissemination of the Crimson Heart Sword Manual's techniques may follow a similar trajectory to the spread of Soul Cultivator technology."

"At that time, numerous vocational colleges will be established to recruit students for these programs."

Director Gao looked intently at Zhang Yu and continued, "And as a primary practitioner of the Crimson Heart Sword Manual, someone who directly cultivates this technique, what kind of impact do you think you'll face?"

"I fear it will be even worse... Controlled by your emotions and desires, you might fall into a joint trap set by the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, accumulating massive debts and becoming a tool in their hands."

Director Gao sighed and shook his head. "The risks are simply too high. That's why I'm urging you to abandon the Crimson Heart Sword Manual. Do not choose this Immortal Sect Technique."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly. "Teacher, I understand. I will keep everything you've said in mind."

Director Gao continued, "Let me give you some more insight. This information wasn't all gathered by me. The principal had others collect and compile it, then handed it to me to pass on to you."

"There may be some exaggeration involved, but I still believe the risks are too great."

Zhang Yu listened silently, nodding.

Director Gao added, "As for the Dharma Realm... you've probably guessed by now that this isn't just the principal's idea, but the Upper Sect's as well."

"The establishment of the Dharma Realm is crucial to the Upper Sect's plans. If it ultimately fails, even Soul Transformation cultivators will face trouble."

Zhang Yu's gaze shifted slightly. "Did the principal also tell you this?"

Director Gao sighed. "The actions of the Ten Great Universities couldn't possibly be without the sects' approval. It's not just Myriad Laws University; the other schools are the same."

"However, now that the competition among the universities has reached a temporary equilibrium, your choice becomes particularly important."

At this point, Director Gao smiled faintly. "If you have any ideas, feel free to share them with me. While I'm here to relay their messages, I can also pass yours along."

Zhang Yu's eyes flashed. "I want to learn more about the cultivation arts of the Immortal Sects. Is there any way to get that information? Ideally, I'd like information on all their techniques."

Director Gao paused, then chuckled wryly. "That's a rather tall order. Gathering information on all the Immortal Sects' cultivation arts is probably impossible... but I'll ask around for you."

Before leaving, Director Gao added, "Oh, and the Four Heavenly Demon Schools might want to meet with you together. You know they're eager to promote their Longevity Technology, so that's likely the topic of discussion."

"The university is aware of this exchange, so don't feel burdened. Just listen to what they have to say."

Watching Director Gao's retreating figure, Zhang Yu let out a mental sigh of relief.

During their conversation, Zhang Yu had felt a sense of support, as if he were no longer alone in facing the overwhelming pressure brought by the Soul Transformation experts.

Just then, a friend request appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye:

"Heavenly Demon University Principal, Divine Monarch Unrestrained: Let's talk."

---

Kunxu, Third Layer.

Inside Wang Yin's Bionic Eye, the final match between Kuang Tianqing and Zhang Yu replayed repeatedly.

As he watched Zhang Yu's ultimate victory, Wang Yin murmured, "The strongest undergraduate..."

"Indeed, the strongest undergraduate."

"Not just the strongest undergraduate."

Feeling the intense activity of his mental cultivation technique in his mind, Wang Yin didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

As he followed the Ten Greats League, witnessing Zhang Yu's successive victories, Wang Yin felt the weight of his own defeat grow heavier.

Zhang Yu's triumphs continuously spurred him on, causing his mental cultivation to advance rapidly and unconsciously. Yet, they also made Zhang Yu seem increasingly invincible in his heart.

Wang Yin felt he was forever living in Zhang Yu's shadow.

"He'll reach Golden Core soon, won't he?"

Now a Graduate Student, having obtained the Golden Core Certificate and becoming a Golden Core True Person, Wang Yin thought to himself, "Given his potential, he'll likely catch up to me in both cultivation realm and cultivation values soon, and surpass me."

Just then, a message appeared before Wang Yin, sent by his mother.

Mother: "Regarding Zhang Yu, the school wants to ask you something."

Wang Yin: "Ask me?"

Mother: "Didn't you have a battle with Zhang Yu on the First Layer? You even added him as a friend afterward. The school wants to communicate with Zhang Yu and is asking for your opinion."

A complex expression crossed Wang Yin's face. After a moment's thought, he began to reply: "He's the strongest opponent I've ever faced in my life, my lifelong rival..."

After Wang Yin finished, his mother replied: "Wait a moment."

Mother: "They want to put you all in a group chat to discuss and exchange ideas."

"Us?" Wang Yin thought.

Moments later, Wang Yin found himself added to a group chat. Besides him, the group included Ye Lingxiao from Immortal Capital on the First Layer, currently studying at Netherworld University.

There was also Kuang Tianqing, who had just finished the Ten Greats League and was currently in a Soul Cultivator state.

And finally, there was Lian Tianji, a student from Joyful Union University.

The organizer of the group chat spoke: "The Soul Transformation experts want to understand Zhang Yu better. Discuss among yourselves and share your thoughts on him."

Kunxu, First Layer.

Songyang City.

Songyang High School.

The teachers who had taught Zhang Yu — physical education teacher Wang Hai, martial dao teacher Lei Jun, and others — were all invited to a conference room.

As they wondered about the sudden gathering, a video began playing in the room: footage from the finals of the Ten Greats League.

"Zhang Yu?"

"What's this competition?"

"Is this... Foundation Establishment? This is Foundation Establishment?"

When the video finished, the room fell silent, the teachers stunned.

After the video ended, a staff member approached the teachers and explained, "This video came from the Second Layer. It shows the finals of the Ten Great Universities League."

"As you saw, Student Yu has won the finals and become the champion of the Ten Greats League — the strongest undergraduate student."

"He will now choose an Immortal Sect Technique to cultivate."

The teachers were shaken anew by this revelation.

"An Immortal Sect Technique?" Wang Hai felt as if he'd been struck by lightning. "My student became the strongest university student? And now he's going to learn an Immortal Sect Technique?"

Lei Jun repeatedly replayed the combat footage in his mind, his expression conflicted. "What a perfect ambush, what a deliberate provocation..." he thought. "Zhang Yu's combat skills have far surpassed mine. His fighting style is now beyond my imagination. But at least he's still using many of the techniques I taught him."

Wang Hai raised his hand. "Could I get a copy of this video?"

Wang Hai had already planned to pin this video on his social media account and play it repeatedly in his fitness studio — the perfect publicity.

Hearing this, Lei Jun glanced over, thinking that if this news got out, his hourly rate for lessons would skyrocket again.

He glanced at the words "Great Use of Martial Dao" embroidered on his chest, wondering if it was time to replace them with a photo of Zhang Yu receiving an award.

A staff member spoke. "The video isn't public yet, but it will be soon. Please be patient."

"We've invited you here because Myriad Laws University wants to make a documentary about Zhang Yu, the Ten Greats League champion. They need to interview his high school teachers."

"In a moment, we'll conduct individual interviews and record a video message of well-wishes. It might be shown to Zhang Yu, so please prepare carefully."

"By the way, where is Zhang Yu's former classroom? Are his desk and chair still there?"

Kunxu Second Layer.

Myriad Laws University, Upper College, Mountains and Rivers College.

After 36 hours of overtime, a notification appeared in Lan Ling's Bionic Eye. To his surprise, it was a friend request from the Department Head.

Feeling both honored and bewildered, Lan Ling accepted. The Department Head immediately sent a message: "Lan Ling, did you attend the same university as Zhang Yu?"

Lan Ling's heart skipped a beat. "Yes," he replied.

"Myriad Laws University is making a documentary about Zhang Yu and needs to interview you."

Lan Ling was stunned. "A documentary about Zhang Yu?!"

Though he knew Zhang Yu had reached the finals of the Ten Greats League, he'd never believed Zhang Yu could defeat Kuang Tianqing. Due to his relentless overtime, he hadn't watched the recent finals. Now, a sudden thought flashed through his mind:

"Could Zhang Yu have..."

He quickly searched the Spirit Realm for information about Zhang Yu. A deluge of news articles poured in:

"Zhang Yu Transforms Kunxu!"

"The World Needs Zhang Yu!"

"The Future Lies in Zhang Yu's Hands!"

As he scrolled through the explosive headlines, Lan Ling felt disoriented and overwhelmed.

"What do I do? Do I have to admit I bullied Zhang Yu in high school?"
