# Chapter 429: Battling Heaven and Earth

Zhang Yu's Formless Spirit General suddenly opened its mouth and unleashed a blazing ray that swept through the air, sending a large contingent of the Yellow Turban Army tumbling over a hundred meters away.

Simultaneously, the Golden Jade Wall floated above the Formless Spirit General's head, unleashing waves of Blazing Sun Rays and Profound Cold Rays that annihilated approaching Yellow Turban Warriors.

However, a Yellow Turban Warrior over ten meters tall charged through the barrage of rays, its body armored with layers of armor several meters thick. Conventional ranged attacks were clearly ineffective against this behemoth.

Just then, the Formless Spirit General slammed its palm forward, unleashing a hurricane-force strike that crashed down upon the Yellow Turban Warrior with overwhelming force!

As the warrior attempted to dodge, the Earth-Suppressing Seal in the Formless Spirit General's palm activated, generating an invisible field that temporarily immobilized the massive warrior.

The giant palm crashed onto the Yellow Turban Warrior's head, unleashing a cataclysmic force. Yet, with precise control, the energy pierced through the warrior's layered armor, converging within its body to erupt in a series of violent explosions!

Amidst the thunderous blasts, the once-unstoppable Yellow Turban Warrior trembled violently before collapsing slowly to the ground.

Roar!

The Formless Spirit General opened its mouth and unleashed another blazing streak that tore through the sky like lightning, hurtling towards the distant Yellow Turban Army!

Thunderous shockwaves erupted across the battlefield.

Simultaneously, the Formless Spirit General twisted its body, unleashing layers of explosive force. It transformed into a living cannonball, hurtling towards the Yellow Turban Army with devastating momentum!

At that moment, Zhang Yu channeled his entire cultivation, his mastery of construction techniques, the power of his magical artifacts, and every ounce of his strength into the Formless Spirit General.

Under his control, the Formless Spirit General transformed into a savage, earth-shattering beast, sweeping through the surging Yellow Turban ranks and scattering limbs and debris across the battlefield!

Similar intense battles raged at other examination sites, some over ten kilometers away, others over twenty.

As the final wave of the Yellow Turban Army's assault crashed down, the pressure on the candidates skyrocketed.

Su Yanyang and another candidate were suddenly plunged into dire straits.

Only Ping Han, Zhang Yu, and Xiao Yunji maintained control, still possessing reserves of strength to safeguard the formation core.

Yet even this was not their most perilous moment.

As the final minute of the Military Certificate Examination ticked away, a transformation rippled through the Yellow Turban Army. Over a dozen colossal Yellow Turban Warriors converged, their bodies contracting and shifting before fusing into a single, multi-limbed monstrosity.

The Yellow Turban Monster resembled a massive mountain of flesh. Twisted arms sprouted from its back and chest, while spider-like legs formed its lower body. Its contorted joints and torso writhed like a nest of snakes.

Roar!

The heads of the dozen Yellow Turban Warriors pressed together, unleashing a unified, thunderous roar. Ironclad Divine Thunder erupted from their mouths like a metallic flood, tearing through the earth and gradually revealing Su Yanyang's Underground Palace.

Behind this creature, more Yellow Turban Warriors were completing their fusion, transforming into additional monsters.

On the Flying Boat:

Director Gao's gaze sharpened. "The final minute — the most critical moment — has arrived!"

Nearby, True Monarch Cloud Haven wore an intrigued expression. "Let's see what surprises these students have saved for last!"

True Monarch Celestial Elephant remarked, "These Yellow Turban Warriors must have been manufactured before the widespread development of magical artifact and Bionic transformation technology."

"The combination transformation technology is a bit crude, still relying heavily on laboratory methods from that era!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven nodded. "It's certainly not a standardized product, but after combining, the shared weapons and armor become significantly thicker, greatly enhancing combat capabilities."

"Its biggest flaw is likely its lack of durability. That's probably why these Yellow Turban Warriors never gained widespread popularity."

"Still, for this final minute of the exam, it's perfectly suited!"

True Monarch Celestial Elephant added, "In this last minute, these Yellow Turban Warriors will unleash their full power, pushing the candidates to their limits. Only then can we truly assess their capabilities!"

As the two judges exchanged remarks, the exam arena was already undergoing dramatic changes.

Su Yanyang's Underground Palace tomb was exposed like an opened skull, laid bare before the Yellow Turban monsters.

With earth-shattering tremors, waves of monsters surged downward, their mindless yet unstoppable violence tearing through Su Yanyang's defensive fortifications. They dug out Su Yanyang himself, along with the formation core.

Xiao Yunji, transformed into a high-speed train, repeatedly shattered the sound barrier, streaking across the battlefield like a white lightning bolt, piercing through the bodies of one Yellow Turban monster after another.

Just as Su Yanyang and another examinee were eliminated!

But soon, more and more Yellow Turban monsters swarmed her body, clinging to her vehicle like malignant tumors, relentlessly slowing her down.

Bionic Synchronization Rate: 80%... 79%...

Feeling her body increasingly weighed down by the Yellow Turban monsters, Xiao Yunji roared in agony, a heart-wrenching pain erupting from every fiber of her being!

"I must obtain the Military Certificate."

"I want to continue my studies."

"I don't want to work for a corporation."

Suddenly, her body shattered into five segments. The once-ten-meter-long high-speed train split into five sections, each hurtling outward in different directions, tearing through the surrounding Yellow Turban monsters!

As her body fragmented, her Bionic Synchronization Rate plummeted to 50%!

It hurts.

It hurts so much.

"Why are you still alive even after I've given it my all?"

Pain threatened to drown every nerve, driving Xiao Yunji to annihilate everything before her. She frenziedly slaughtered the Yellow Turban monsters, lost in a haze of fury.

But as her body recklessly tore through the battlefield, a Yellow Turban Warrior charged straight toward the formation core and launched an attack!

Upon receiving the notification that the formation core's integrity had dropped to 98%, Xiao Yunji roared furiously and charged wildly at the Yellow Turban Warriors. Her five bodies moved like colossal bolts of lightning, tearing the monsters to shreds!

"What a pity about Xiao Yunji!" True Monarch Cloud Haven remarked from the Flying Boat. "This setback has cost her any chance at the Military Certificate."

True Monarch Celestial Elephant shrugged casually. "What's there to regret? Ping Han's repeated breakthroughs have already surpassed all other candidates. It's no surprise Xiao Yunji couldn't secure the certificate."

"But Zhang Yu... he's quite the unexpected contender!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven nodded slightly. He hadn't anticipated Zhang Yu's ability to endure this far.

At that moment, only Ping Han and Zhang Yu remained with the formation core at 100% integrity.

Ping Han had fully activated his Bionics, his magical artifacts operating at full power, shaking the examination grounds as if heaven and earth were collapsing. He relentlessly suppressed the Yellow Turban monsters.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu controlled his Formless Spirit General, fighting like a berserk beast. Through countless desperate clashes, he stubbornly repelled the relentless onslaught.

Both candidates had pushed their fighting spirit, physical strength, and magical artifacts to their absolute limits, unleashing their hidden potential and reserves in a frenzy.

At this critical juncture, both had reached the peak of their combat prowess, locked in a white-hot struggle.

"Remarkable!" True Monarch Celestial Elephant exclaimed. "I thought Ping Han alone was astonishing, but to see Zhang Yu contend with him so fiercely is truly unexpected!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven watched the battlefield with anticipation. "Ping Han still seems to have the upper hand, but I wonder if either of them has any hidden cards left to play."

Meanwhile, Fifth-Rank Righteous God Gengchen Yi's mind raced with information and assessments of Ping Han and Zhang Yu.

One, Ping Han, had spent years cultivating his talents, already a prodigy in the Civil Engineering Department, only to plummet into despair after a cryptocurrency disaster. Yet he refused to be defeated, clawing his way back from the abyss. Now, wielding the power of the Transformation God Coin, he sought to harness the forces of heaven and earth, determined to sweep through the Military Certificate Examination and claim victory.

The other, Zhang Yu, possessed peerless talent, perfectly blending his mastery of civil engineering, magical artifacts, and martial arts. He pushed every ounce of his strength and potential to its absolute limit, now battling heaven and earth with his own might, confronting the Yellow Turban Monster Legion head-on.

At that moment, Gengchen Yi surveyed the battlefield, no longer seeing merely a clash between candidates and Yellow Turban monsters, but a fierce duel between Ping Han and Zhang Yu.

No, it was more than just a duel between Ping Han and Zhang Yu.

It was watching Ping Han roam freely through a world reshaped by the distant will of the Jade Liquid Divine Monarch, ten thousand miles away, while Zhang Yu struggled desperately beneath the same transformed heavens.

Geng Chenyi thought to himself, "Zhang Yu isn't just sparring with Ping Han right now. He's enduring the unintentional mental pressure from a Divine Monarch tens of thousands of miles away!"

Director Gao watched the intense battle unfolding in the examination hall, feeling a tension he had never experienced before.

"Zhang Yu has actually held out this long?"

"That kid... he must have planned this before the exam, right? To compete for the Military Certificate!"

Director Gao had believed he fully understood Zhang Yu's talent and potential, but the young man's progress over the past year had far exceeded his expectations.

"Who will win? Who will claim the Military Certificate?"

At that moment, Director Gao realized that no matter who emerged victorious, he would feel a pang of regret for the defeated student.

Beside him, Director Lin watched the battlefield with an icy expression. "Ping Han... Zhang Yu... How can the War Faction's stubborn minds produce such geniuses?"

Just then, True Monarch Celestial Elephant's gaze sharpened. "Only a few seconds left!"

He glanced at Ping Han's position and chuckled. "So Ping Han was holding back after all?"

Simultaneously, everyone's attention snapped to Ping Han's location.

As the earth trembled violently, a massive cloud of dust erupted into the sky, and the horizon began to slowly rise!
