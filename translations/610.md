# Chapter 610: The Power of Unity

The Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art could devour various attacks, but it could not devour matter.

This was the conclusion Zhang Yu had reached after recalling relevant intelligence and combining it with his own observations and reasoning.

Under the assault of ten thousand flying swords, Zhang Yu was confident that Kuang Tianqing would no longer be able to use the Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art to defend against the onslaught.

"Next is the Heavenly Demon Void Technique."

"This daoist art's body etherealization isn't a 100% full-body effect. Each etherealization can only affect a portion of the body, and even with the enhancement from a military-grade Bionic, it cannot exceed 90% of the body's tissues."

"Therefore, as long as we can blanket her entire body with attacks, we can inflict damage and wound her!"

The Heavenly Sun Radiance Roar erupted in a dazzling burst of flames, continuously detonating outward in all directions and unleashing streams of golden light, as if to ignite the entire battlefield.

"Three days was ultimately too short, but thanks to the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology, I managed to make a minor modification to the Heavenly Sun Radiance God."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "By activating the unstable state of the Eternal Sun Star Core within the puppet, the Eternal Sun Radiance Flame will generate explosive shockwaves, continuously emitting wide-area, omnidirectional fire shockwaves."

"Combine the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill to enhance the flames' combustion properties. Just a touch will act like a propellant, causing continuous burning and relentless high-temperature assaults..."

Flying swords! Flames! They surged ceaselessly toward Kuang Tianqing, threatening to engulf her.

But it wasn't enough!

In Zhang Yu's eyes, this was far from sufficient to defeat Kuang Tianqing.

So, while executing these maneuvers, he concealed twelve Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords among the tens of thousands other swords.

"Kuang Tianqing, these twelve Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords here are connected to the twelve Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords on the battlefield outside, forming the Sword Realm."

"Do you understand what this means?"

With a deafening roar, a Thunderfire blast erupted from within the sword formation.

This was the power of the defense towers outside the prison, channeled through the sword formation by Zhang Yu.

As if this were the opening strike, a torrent of thunderlight and sword qi followed.

Ye Xingli unleashed a strike at the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword before her, thinking, "Just try to survive, Junior Brother."

Wen Wuya manipulated his flying sword, slashing a stream of sword qi at a Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword. "Borrowing power, are you? Fine, take some of mine. Just don't die at Kuang Tianqing's hands."

Bai Zhenzhen unleashed a crimson sword qi, thinking, "Yu Zi... I believe in you. You can definitely do this."

Although the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation could transmit power within the sword formation, it required precise coordination between the participants and couldn't be done arbitrarily.

At this moment, through the connection between the inner and outer sword formations, Zhang Yu wasn't just leveraging the terrain to attack Kuang Tianqing; he was also drawing upon the combined strength of Bai Zhenzhen, Wen Wuya, and Ye Xingli. It was as if all four of them were simultaneously attacking Kuang Tianqing in a coordinated assault.

Barely a second after the battle began, Zhang Yu had already fully exploited every advantage: the terrain, magical artifacts, cultivation arts, and his teammates.

Kuang Tianqing was forced into a rapid retreat, her evasive maneuvers increasingly constricted. In the blink of an eye, she was cornered, with nowhere left to go.

The Soul Cultivators assisting in operating the magical artifacts trembled with excitement at the sight.

Zhao Tianxing grew ecstatic. "We can do it! We're stronger than her now!"

Hu Yuntao's excitement surged, his Spirit Realm signal flickering erratically. "This is our chance! She's got nowhere to run!"

Grandfather Yingxin urgently reminded them, "Don't lose focus! Concentrate! The opportunity is here!"

They seemed to already envision their victory over Kuang Tianqing, the moment they would achieve unprecedented success in the Ten Greats League arena, seizing the Soul Cultivators' chance to rise as true adults!

"How annoying," Kuang Tianqing muttered.

Facing an onslaught that threatened to engulf her in the next instant, Kuang Tianqing's face revealed only disgust. It was as if Zhang Yu's meticulous preparations, elaborate strategies, and the unwavering support of his teammates... all filled her with revulsion.

"Immortal Scum," she spat.

As the attack bore down, lines of massive characters projected above Kuang Tianqing's head:

"You think fighting me once means you understand me?"

"You think you've truly fought me at my full strength?"

"You truly believe you know how strong I am?"

In the next instant, Kuang Tianqing's Bionic armor abruptly lit up segment by segment as she chanted: "Heaven-Seizing Creation, Soul Transformation's Choice, Immortal Grade within the Bionic."

Immediately, a line of text illuminated across her chest: Cursed Heaven Myriad Demon Throne

Zhang Yu instantly realized, "Heaven-Seizing Creation is that Bionic company affiliated with Heavenly Demon University, right?"

He knew Heaven-Seizing Creation was a Bionic company on par with the Myriad Paths Artisan Sect, Vajra Profound Creation, and Heavenly Craftsman, but with a distinct Heavenly Demon style. It was rarely seen at Myriad Laws University.

"Is this a Bionic advertisement?" Zhang Yu's expression immediately turned grave. After all, any Bionic that would warrant Kuang Tianqing reciting an advertisement for it must be an extremely powerful one.

Indeed, that was the case. If the Bionic Kuang Tianqing had equipped during their previous battle had specialized in tracking, assassination, and stealth, then the one she wore today was purpose-built for combat.

The Bionic was called the Cursed Heaven Myriad Demon Throne, its full name being the Cursed Heaven Myriad Demon Throne Meridian System. Artificial meridians ran throughout Kuang Tianqing's entire body.

As the Cursed Heaven Myriad Demon Throne activated, Magic Power coursed through her meridians, enveloping her body in a black aura.

With a thunderous roar, the barrage of attacks slammed into Kuang Tianqing's body, but they were like waves crashing against a rocky shore — completely ineffective.

Ignoring the relentless stabs from tens of thousands of flying swords, Kuang Tianqing strode toward Zhang Yu, coldly remarking, "All this messy preparation makes it seem like you actually thought you could win."

"What support from teammates, advance preparations, terrain advantages, formations..."

"What good would any of that do for you?"

"You're far too weak."

"My individual strength far surpasses yours."

"With such a vast gap in individual power, everything you do is just a joke, understand? Immortal Scum."

The Soul Cultivators were stunned to see their meticulously prepared assault fail to even scratch their opponent.

Zhao Tianxing: "How is this possible?"

Hu Yuntao: "Completely unscathed? What kind of Bionic is that?"

After a long silence, Che Yufei couldn't help but say, "We can't even break through his defenses... Zhang Yu, should we consider retreating?"

Meanwhile, throughout the battle, Zhang Yu continued to live-stream the fight to the Four-School Group chat.

Watching this unfold, Ye Xingli's heart sank. "Even with all this combined power and Zhang Yu's meticulous preparations, they're still no match for Kuang Tianqing."

Wen Wuya sighed inwardly, "We've all underestimated Kuang Tianqing. That person... has been loaded with countless resources to support her pursuit of the championship. She can't be defeated by merely combining the strengths of a few people."

Zhang Yu's gaze was equally solemn as he frantically analyzed Kuang Tianqing's condition through the Bionic Eye, Heavenly Sun Radiance God, and Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation.

Simultaneously, the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology was running again, analyzing and modifying the design blueprint of the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword to find her weaknesses.

His dao heart level instantly burned to 19th grade (23%). Another activation of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology would likely cause it to drop below the 19th grade.

But the result was worth the risk.

"Good, it seems Master and I can decipher this thing after all..."

Gazing at the evolving design schematics, a flash of insight struck Zhang Yu. "The Cursed Heaven Myriad Demon Throne is essentially a meridian system. It connects the entire body into a unified whole, allowing any attack that touches a single point to be distributed throughout the body for defense."

"By combining this with the Heavenly Demon Void Technique, it can transfer attacks into the etherealized body, drastically weakening their impact..."

"But this isn't limitless."

"There must be a breaking point."

"Moreover, with his entire meridian system occupied in this state, she likely can't use many military-grade daoist arts or martial arts techniques."

"Now's our chance!"

Zhang Yu roared at the Soul Cultivators, "Don't be afraid! We still have our trump card!"

Thunderlight erupted from the pipes in the walls — the Sword Pills Zhang Yu had crafted alongside the flying swords.

"Though they're only accelerated by the simplified Primordial Magnetic Channels I built, after all this time, the accumulated momentum is finally ready to unleash its full power!"

In an instant, hundreds upon thousands of Sword Pills tore through the atmosphere like bolts of lightning, hurtling toward Kuang Tianqing under the Primordial Magnetic Channel's acceleration.

Combined with the earlier Myriad Swords Formation and the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's bombardment, this relentless assault finally left a faint, hairline scratch on Kuang Tianqing's body.

But the minute scratch didn't faze her. She merely curled her lip in disdain.

"I told you, my personal strength far surpasses yours."

"And don't think you were the only one preparing these past three days."

Kuang Tianqing pointed her finger forward, and with a thunderous shattering of her arm, a crimson glow suddenly blocked the incoming attack.

Immediately afterward, the shattered limb writhed and rapidly regenerated.

"During these three days, I borrowed power from other students through dual cultivation," Kuang Tianqing said with a smirk. "The Netherworld University's Disintegration Technique combined with the White Bone University's Regeneration Technique."

"However, my uses are limited. Let's see if I can finish you off within these few attempts."

In the next instant, Kuang Tianqing unleashed a relentless cycle of disintegration and regeneration, instantly breaking through the layered defenses and charging toward Zhang Yu.

Watching Kuang Tianqing wield destruction with one hand and regeneration with the other, charging against the torrent of countless flying swords and Sword Pills like a divine demon, the Soul Cultivators felt their minds grind to a halt, as if their souls were being gripped by her hand.

Zhao Tianxing's heart sank. "She's too strong... the gap is too vast..."

Hu Yuntao said anxiously, "We were preparing, but Kuang Tianqing was also preparing. Her combat power is even greater than it was three days ago."

Che Yufei felt a chill run down his spine. "Three days ago, she wasn't even using her full strength. Now, she's merely wielding borrowed power, and she hasn't even unleashed her true ultimate techniques yet. Even with just this, she's already shattered all our strategies."

Zhang Yu felt unwilling to accept it, but he had to admit, "This is simply the difference in individual ability."

"Even if I could perceive her weaknesses and pinpoint her most vulnerable moments, my current individual strength still isn't enough to defeat her..."

Just then, a message flashed across Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye:

Dao Qiankun: I'll lend you my power.

Dao Qiankun: Try using my strength to compensate for your individual shortcomings.

In the next instant, under Kuang Tianqing's gaze, the Myriad Swords Formation was instantly enveloped in a surging sea of thunderlight.

The pulsating thunderlight seemed to come alive, transforming into serpentine dragon-like forms. Dao Qiankun's voice echoed from within them.

"Kuang Tianqing, our battle isn't over yet."

Kuang Tianqing snorted coldly. "You're here sooner than I expected."

From the moment Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing clashed, their fierce battle unfolded at lightning speed, a flurry of strikes exchanged in mere moments. Kuang Tianqing had gained an overwhelming advantage, but Dao Qiankun's reinforcement arrived just in time.

Watching the battle footage Zhang Yu had transmitted, Dao Qiankun thought to himself, "I didn't expect you to hold out this long. Then let my power help you endure a little longer."

With just a few more moments, Dao Qiankun would reach the battlefield.

Zhang Yu's resilience, combined with Dao Qiankun's intervention, immediately sparked a reaction within the Four-School Group.

Zhang Yu, whom everyone had initially believed would be instantly defeated, now appeared to be a worthy target for support.

"Brother Dao has intervened?" Yan Qianji said. "Then take my power too."

Cang Shenyu, Vajra University's top student, scoffed, "I didn't expect Zhang Yu to still be alive. Lending him some power won't hurt."

Tian Shengong, Immortal Armaments University's top student, chuckled. "Haha, take it and hold on!"

As the power of student after student flowed into the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation, Kuang Tianqing, who had been advancing relentlessly like a blade through butter, gradually slowed her pace.

"He's holding them off!" Ye Xingli exclaimed.

"With this much support," Zhao Tianxing declared, "even Kuang Tianqing can't break through!"

Che Yufei shouted, "Hold him off! Dao Qiankun is almost here!"

Just as everyone's spirits were rising, Kuang Tianqing coldly retorted, "I've already told you."

"Do you still not understand the gap in individual power?"

"Even with the support of all these people, how much power can your sword formation truly gather? How much of it can you effectively control? It all depends on your personal limitations."

"Your disadvantage lies in your very weakness."

As she spoke, Kuang Tianqing stroked her swelling belly and said indifferently, "Immortal Scum, this move was originally prepared for Dao Qiankun.

"To die by this move is a privilege. It's also enough to earn you a significant surge in popularity and attention."

In the next instant, Kuang Tianqing opened her mouth and spat out a pulsating mass of flesh and blood.

This was a Demonic Fetus she had cultivated within her own body, infused with Immortal Dao power borrowed from Netherworld University and White Bone University.

An earth-shattering surge of Magic Power erupted from it, throwing the surrounding Magic Power Circuits into chaotic disarray.

As the Demonic Fetus repeatedly disintegrated and regenerated, the forces of life and death converged within it, creating a cyclical loop of existence and destruction.

After nine consecutive cycles and nine explosions, the Demonic Fetus was finally annihilated.

A deafening roar reverberated across the entire battlefield.

The surrounding walls shattered and crumbled, layer by layer, dissolving into nothingness.

The entire prison ceiling was blasted open, revealing the sky to the combatants once more.

Gazing at the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, now half-destroyed, Kuang Tianqing sneered. With a lightning-fast movement, she seized the puppet and unleashed torrents of Gang Qi, tearing toward Zhang Yu within.

Kuang Tianqing aimed to swiftly subdue Zhang Yu before Dao Qiankun could arrive.

Meanwhile, the Soul Cultivators had descended into chaos.

Che Yufei: "Damn it! Zhang Yu's been captured!"

Zhao Tianxing: "What do we do? What do we do?"

Hu Yuntao: "They're going to humiliate Zhang Yu!"

Grandfather Yingxin said hoarsely, "We've exhausted all our preparations and plans, yet we're still no match for her..."

But just then, a sudden chill ran down Kuang Tianqing's spine, jolting her with a profound sense of impending danger.

Zhang Yu turned to the Soul Cultivators and said, "All of you, retreat now."

"This next move... I've been preparing it alone."

The Soul Cultivators were stunned. Another plan? How could they have known nothing about it?

Zhang Yu gazed coldly at Kuang Tianqing before him. "You're right," he said. "Your personal strength completely surpasses mine. Even with borrowed power, defeating you seems almost impossible."

Seeing the bleak expression on Zhang Yu's face, Kuang Tianqing felt a sudden unease. The next moment, she sensed his life force rapidly draining away.

"If I can't defeat you, then let's both lose together."

Kuang Tianqing's heart jolted. She lunged backward, but Zhang Yu was already upon her.

"Kuang Tianqing, the more I fight you, the more I realize... I have one advantage you lack in this battle."

"I can die, but you can't."

"Because you're too valuable."

"My life! I offer it to you!"

"In this round, you will be defeated!"

In the next instant, Zhang Yu unleashed the full force of his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. The entire prison structure shuddered and began to reshape itself, while Zhang Yu gradually transformed into a living stake, embracing Kuang Tianqing's position.

Simultaneously, the walls and armor plates, responding to Zhang Yu's will, converged from all directions, forming a colossal, towering beast poised to completely engulf both Kuang Tianqing and Zhang Yu.

"A Living Stake?!" Zhao Tianxing exclaimed. "Zhang Yu's throwing his life away?!"

Grandfather Yingxin said, "He's sacrificing his own life to trap Kuang Tianqing."

Amidst a thunderous roar, Kuang Tianqing bellowed, "You think you can trap me?"

"You can't stop me alive, and you certainly can't stop me dead!"

"Civil Engineering Holy Body, activate!"

As Zhang Yu gradually transformed into a Living Stake, his life nearing its end, his physical resilience surged to unprecedented levels.

Especially in his final moments, with the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon's ultimate activation, his body became a hybrid existence — half magical artifact, half human.

"Kuang Tianqing, this is my final strike..."

Fueled by the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, the walls erupted into countless colossal palms, amplified by the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon, crashing down upon Kuang Tianqing to imprison her completely.

As Zhang Yu gradually became one with the Living Stake, a sudden illusion surged through his mind — he felt as if he had become the entire prison itself, ready to devour Kuang Tianqing whole.

Ye Xingli, witnessing the scene, cried out in alarm, "Zhang Yu!"

Nine Heavens Liu murmured, "He's actually pushed himself this far?"

Yan Qianji exclaimed, "There's hope! It looks like Kuang Tianqing might actually..."

Yu Xinghan, watching the live broadcast, froze in place. "That Zhang Yu..."

Director Gao clenched his fists, muttering under his breath, "Swallow her whole."

In the laboratory, True Monarch Magnetic Pole halted her experiment again, her gaze fixed intently on the unfolding scene in the live broadcast.
