# Chapter 486: Confrontation Before the Divine Monarch (Thank you to "Mad Night Unending" for stuffing Zhang Yu with dog food!)

"That damned Feng Yuhuan!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole was furious with Feng Yuhuan's actions in the Research Department.

"Since when does he have the right to interfere in my laboratory?"

"Now he's meddling with even the most critical experimental subjects. Will he start monitoring everyone's chat logs? Will he start surveilling everyone's Bionic Eyes?"

"If he's already monitoring and reviewing everything, what's left for me to investigate?"

"As the project progresses and its importance grows, will he start controlling my schedule? Will he eventually meddle with the project's funding and personnel decisions?"

Of course, while True Monarch Magnetic Pole was deeply dissatisfied with Feng Yuhuan's actions and prepared to retaliate, she also understood that his actions had a rationale.

As the project's significance increased, stricter control over personnel and resources was inevitable.

"But this control must remain in my hands."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole knew she had to maintain control over the project's management. She would never relinquish it willingly.

Regarding Zhang Yu's situation, True Monarch Magnetic Pole saw both advantages and disadvantages to him leaving campus. She decided to ask Zhang Yu for his opinion, hoping to choose the path that would benefit him most.

Hearing her question, Zhang Yu pondered for a moment before sharing his thoughts.

In truth, he had already discussed the matter with Lady Fortune on their way back and reached a decision.

As his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power continued to purify, the Yin Artifact Experiment was attracting increasing attention. Leaving campus might indeed provoke action from rival universities.

However, staying in University City would mean a sharp drop in income and abandoning the Civil Engineering Competition he had been preparing for so long. It might even jeopardize his chances of transferring departments...

"If that happens, my progress will be hindered, and my chances of joining a Sect in the future will diminish."

"Moreover, if this precedent is set, might they further restrict me? Confine me to the Laboratory? Monitor me 24/7?"

Zhang Yu was vehemently opposed to such measures.

Compared to the escalating pressure he might face on campus, the risks outside seemed far less daunting.

As long as he maintained strict secrecy, his safety wouldn't be compromised.

If he could secure the support and protection of Myriad Laws, his safety would be further enhanced.

In the direst of emergencies, his sister, stationed in the Supreme Clarity Realm, could conceal his Spirit Realm information.

The Divine Spiritual Root copied from Bai Zhenzhen allowed him to conceal his presence.

The Azure Silk Flying Sword provided a direct link to the Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword network, enabling him to request immediate assistance from True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Director Gao at any time.

When True Monarch Magnetic Pole asked about his plans, Zhang Yu delivered his prepared response: "Teacher, I want to go out."

"I don't want to limit my Immortal Dao potential because of the experiment. I want to earn more money and advance further on the Immortal Dao path."

"As for the risks, I believe they are manageable..."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded slightly. "Your reasoning is sound, but some aspects require deeper consideration."

"Come with me to see Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations."

"We can discuss the specific strategies and their pros and cons along the way."

Zhang Yu exclaimed in surprise, "Go directly to see... the Divine Monarch?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "With the Divine Monarch's endorsement, we can bypass most obstacles and maximize the project's development."

University City, 666th Layer.

Since the completion of the 666th Layer, Zhang Yu had never set foot inside.

Whenever he passed by via the Anti-Gravity Passage or the Magnetic Pole Passage, he could only see the entire layer sealed off. He didn't even know where the entrance was.

Zhang Yu often wondered what lay hidden within this completely sealed 666th Layer.

A secret laboratory? A repository for vital data? A treasure vault for precious magical artifacts and Bionics?

Today, as he finally entered the 666th Layer and beheld the blue skies, white clouds, and boundless plains, Zhang Yu was astonished. "This is..."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "Virtual reality technology from the Spirit Realm. Reality and illusion intertwine, blurring the lines between what is real and what is not."

Director Gao, standing nearby, added, "When you meet Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations later, try not to be too surprised."

Zhang Yu had no idea what True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Director Gao had discussed, nor how they had summoned Director Gao. He only knew that Director Gao had joined them halfway to the 666th Layer.

Now, True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Director Gao led Zhang Yu across the plains. Before long, they came upon a village.

Mud-brick houses with rough thatched roofs lined the village, their walls eroded by rainwater into deep grooves. The ground was slick with mud left by the recent rain.

Zhang Yu listened to the clucking of hens scratching for food, the grunts of pigs in their pens, the sound of women drawing water, and the coughing from the kitchen. He watched villagers pass by, their waists cinched with straw rope belts, their clothes patched and faded, their feet shod in straw sandals.

For a moment, Zhang Yu felt a strange illusion, as if he had traveled back in time to an ancient rural village.

Yet throughout their journey, the villagers hadn't so much as glanced at them, treating Zhang Yu, Director Gao, and True Monarch Magnetic Pole as if they were invisible. This only deepened Zhang Yu's sense of unease.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole explained, "They're not True Persons. Don't mind them."

The trio stopped abruptly. True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Director Gao bowed slightly to a villager working in the fields, addressing him respectfully, "Divine Monarch."

Zhang Yu stared at the figure before him, his heart leaping in surprise. "Che Yufei?"

The Che Yufei standing before him possessed no Foundation Establishment Domain, no Spirit Realm Projection above his head. From outward appearance to inner essence, there was no trace of the Spirit Realm about him — he seemed like an ordinary mortal.

Che Yufei glanced at the three of them and smiled faintly. "Magnetic Pole, Greenwood, you've arrived?"

He turned to Zhang Yu and said casually, "You must be Zhang Yu. You seem to recognize this newly acquired body of mine?"

His gaze sharpened momentarily, as if countless images flashed through his eyes. Then he smiled again. "Ah, you're both from the Civil Engineering Department. You even worked on projects together and competed in the Civil Engineering Competition?"

"Don't worry, I have an unrestricted soul possession certificate. Che Yufei is just one of the recent bodies I've acquired."

Watching Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations' serene smile, Zhang Yu felt as if he were witnessing the Financial Storm, where countless lives had been devoured by this very being.

Zhang Yu quickly composed himself and bowed respectfully.

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations chuckled. "No need to be afraid. An unrestricted soul possession certificate isn't a free pass. It still costs money. I wouldn't bother possessing living people casually — that would be letting you off too easy."

He then turned to True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Director Gao, saying casually, "What's the matter? Speak your minds."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole tapped her fingertip, and a series of holographic images materialized instantly.

As she displayed scenes from the Civil Engineering League, she explained, "The rapid promotion of this project's achievements is due to Zhang Yu's participation in the Civil Engineering League."

"Allowing Zhang Yu to continue competing in the league would not only showcase our accomplishments but also further promote them, laying the groundwork for future product sales."

"The Civil Engineering League is an unparalleled promotional opportunity."

Director Gao, standing beside her, tapped his fingertip to switch the display to the league's information. Pointing to the final prize, he added, "Furthermore, the champion of this year's Civil Engineering Competition will receive the design blueprint for military-grade armor specifically tailored for construction applications."

Although Director Gao understood this was a common tactic used by higher authorities to intensify competition among universities, he couldn't deny the prize's allure.

He continued, "With Zhang Yu and Mo Shangjin competing this year, the Civil Engineering Department has an excellent chance of securing the championship. This victory would significantly enhance the reputation of Myriad Laws University's Civil Engineering Department and boost the stock prices of numerous affiliated companies."

Director Gao knew that the Civil Engineering Department held shares in many companies, and Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations indirectly owned significant stakes in several of them.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole added, "Military-Grade Armor can compensate for the Artifact Refinement Department's lack of accumulated expertise in armor. With slight modifications by our department, it can become another independently developed Military-Grade masterpiece for Myriad Laws University."

As she spoke, True Monarch Magnetic Pole waved her hand, displaying Zhang Yu's academic achievements.

Director Gao's eyes widened at Zhang Yu's meteoric rise in exam scores and rankings over his three years of university, his early acquisition of a Military Certificate in his Third-Year, and his cultivation of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. He straightened his chest slightly, feeling a surge of pride.

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations, however, saw more than just Zhang Yu's Civil Engineering accomplishments. He noted that Zhang Yu had completed and passed the first three years of the Artifact Refinement Department's curriculum, mastered various artifact crafting techniques, and planned to transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department in the future.

The Divine Monarch nodded slightly. "Zhang Yu is indeed a talented individual. Old Gao, you've done well."

Director Gao smiled. "It was no trouble at all. Everything is for the sake of the university."

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations laughed heartily. "It's rare to see such magnanimity. If all the teachers in our departments were as dedicated to the university's interests as you are, what would stop Myriad Laws from becoming Kunxu's premier university?"

Director Gao felt a strange unease at these words.

Before he could dwell on it, Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations continued, "While sending students out has its benefits, what about the risks?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "The risks are manageable..."

Just then, a voice interrupted her. "Magnetic Pole, don't spout nonsense. Who dares guarantee the risks are manageable?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole turned to see Feng Yuhuan's Spirit Realm Projection materialize beside them, his gaze cold and piercing.

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations smiled faintly. "I've also summoned Xiao Feng. Let's discuss these issues face-to-face. Once the reasoning is clear, there's nothing we can't negotiate."

Feng Yuhuan fixed his gaze on True Monarch Magnetic Pole. "Magnetic Pole, explain how these risks are manageable."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole snorted coldly. "With the university's resources, we can easily secure a few magical artifacts and talismans. Surely that's enough to protect a single student?"

"Besides, I'm always watching and ready to intervene. Didn't I protect Zhang Yu perfectly well at Heavenly Sword?"

Director Gao, who had been about to offer his own protection for Zhang Yu, opened his mouth but ultimately said nothing after hearing True Monarch Magnetic Pole's words.

"Good," Director Gao thought to himself. "Magnetic Pole's reputation carries more weight. Her words will be more effective."

Feng Yuhuan sneered. "A student? Is he just an ordinary student? He carries the Laboratory's research results — that makes him school property."

"And does mitigating risk require no further investment? The school's magical artifacts and talismans are being thrown into this just to nurture you Artifact Refinement Department people? Magnetic Pole! Is this the school's project or your own personal project?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole retorted, "Don't try to change the subject! We're discussing whether the risks are manageable! What's this about 'your people' and 'my people'? It sounds like someone's trying to seize the project for themselves and claim all the credit."

"Feng Yuhuan, don't pretend you don't know how you climbed to your position or how much you've skimmed from the accounts!"

"What the hell are you talking about?!" Feng Yuhuan roared. "I'm trying to protect the school's assets and minimize project risks, and you're maliciously slandering me? Is this how the Artifact Refinement Department conducts itself?"

The heavens and earth trembled slightly as Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations' voice slowly echoed, "Let's stick to the facts. We are all Teachers of Myriad Laws. There's no need for personal attacks."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "Feng Yuhuan, you claim it's too dangerous outside and forbid project members from leaving. But is the school truly 100% safe?"

"Protecting project members is the school's responsibility, of course. But does that mean we should confine every successful project to University City? Lock them in laboratories?"

"Participating in competitions would actually generate more publicity..."

Feng Yuhuan's gaze sharpened. "Fine, let's talk about competitions. Even if you, True Monarch Magnetic Pole, can protect Zhang Yu outside the school, what about in the arena?"

"If Zhang Yu is beaten to his knees in the Civil Engineering League, publicly humiliated and defiled before a crowd, and then harvested for materials, can you still protect him? Would that benefit the project's publicity?"

"Or do you want to keep pouring funds into Zhang Yu, forcing us to secure every competition for him in the future? Is this bottomless pit your investment?"
