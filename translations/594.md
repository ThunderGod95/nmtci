# Chapter 594: Arrival at the Floating Continent, Kuang Tianqing

Bai Zhenzhen: "I cultivate the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao precisely so that I won't accidentally harm Yu Zi in the future."

"I'm afraid that if my flying sword is too fierce, I might accidentally injure him when we face each other in the Ten Greats League."

Bai Zhenzhen gazed at the sword before her. "This flying sword is so quiet and peaceful. I think it's perfect."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said coldly, "If you want it, take it. Consider it a gift from me. You don't need to return it later — I never wanted it in the first place anyway."

Bai Zhenzhen paused slightly, a strange feeling creeping into her heart.

"Was Master... just angry?"

---

Just as the academic overachievers from various universities were preparing for the Ten Greats League, making their final preparations before the competition...

At Myriad Laws University...

Today was the day Zhang Yu was leaving University City to head to the Ten Greats League arena.

He was currently directing his assistants as they moved equipment and materials.

Liu Xiangqiao, standing nearby, asked in surprise, "Boss, are we taking everything?"

Zhang Yu nodded, his tone matter-of-fact. "Bring all the equipment and materials I've circled on the list. We can continue artifact refinement once we get there."

He glanced at the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor resting on the laboratory workbench.

The armor was composed of countless metal scales mimicking those of a Demon Beast, now hovering silently in the air like a shed beast hide.

Despite Zhang Yu's frantic efforts over the past few weeks — pouring in vast amounts of Spirit Coins and his entire focus, even expanding his laboratory team to seven assistants — time had still proven insufficient.

So far, he had only managed to refine the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor to Level 10.

"Just a little more... just a little more to reach Level 11..."

"At the very least, I need to advance the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor to the Foundation Establishment level."

To this end, Zhang Yu not only rented a Flying Boat like some others, but also leased equipment from the Artifact Refinement Laboratory, intending to move it onto the Flying Boat so he could continue his artifact refinement work en route to the competition venue.

After all, the Ten Greats League wasn't a one- or two-day affair; it could stretch for a month or two. Zhang Yu believed he would have plenty of time for cultivation and artifact refinement during that period.

In reality, the ten members of the school team each had different needs and circumstances, traveling to the Ten Greats League arena via various means of transportation and preparing their accommodations based on their individual requirements.

For example, to accommodate his experimental equipment, Zhang Yu rented a large Flying Boat this time, the price far exceeding that of an ordinary one.

First, there were the 200 Spirit Coins he spent cultivating the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon. Then came the investment in refining the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, the increased number of assistants, and now the rental fees for the Flying Boat and laboratory equipment.

Zhang Yu's savings had been dwindling steadily. His once massive fortune of over 700 Spirit Coins had dwindled to a mere 150 Spirit Coins.

"Sigh, artifact refinement really burns through money like water."

Yet Zhang Yu understood that this was largely due to his recent total immersion in self-improvement, leaving little mental bandwidth for earning. Had he focused more on wealth accumulation, his reserves would have been far more substantial.

Just then, several figures approached Zhang Yu.

"You guys..."

A look of surprise spread across Zhang Yu's face as he saw Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan, Shi Huaiyu, Xiao Qingxuan, Shi Yunxiang, Ying Xin, and the others standing before him.

"Weren't you all supposed to be working overtime?"

Yu Xinghan smiled. "We discussed it and decided to come see you off after all."

"We can work overtime any day," Xiao Qingxuan added.

"But an event of this scale — the Ten Greats League — might only happen once in a lifetime," Ying Xin said.

Le Mulan blushed slightly. "Zhang Yu, I brought you some potions."

She worried that Zhang Yu might now look down on the potions she had poured all her effort into refining.

Zhang Yu quickly took the items, saying, "Thanks, these will all be really useful."

Shi Huaiyu said, "President Zhang, once you bring back a good ranking, our company will be so busy we won't know what to do with all the work."

Shi Yunxiang warned, "Be careful when facing Celestial Monsters University students. You're already on their 'discrimination list' and 'must-defeat' list..."

Xiao Qingxuan added, "I've sent you some techniques for 'breakthroughs.' But remember, ancient methods differ from modern ones, so use them as a reference only — don't copy them blindly."

Ying Xin chimed in, "Grandpas, make sure you all listen carefully to the Boss! If there's work to be done, volunteer first! The leaders are watching, so you need to make a good impression!"

After bidding farewell to his colleagues one by one, Zhang Yu watched their departing figures and thought to himself, "These guys... they are usually afraid to work less overtime, yet they still came to see me off."

"They're all counting on me, their Boss, to carry them to success in the future, aren't they?"

Just as Zhang Yu boarded the Flying Boat, another figure appeared before him.

Zhang Yu's expression sharpened. "Teacher!"

Director Gao nodded at him. "Are all your preparations complete?"

Zhang Yu nodded. "Everything's ready."

Director Gao: "Do you know the assembly point? The competition grounds this time are quite extensive."

Zhang Yu replied, "Don't worry, Teacher. True Monarch Tranquility provided navigation."

After a series of final reminders, Director Gao leaned in close, avoiding the assistants nearby, and whispered, "Do you have enough money?"

Zhang Yu smiled. "Don't worry, Teacher. I have enough."

Director Gao patted Zhang Yu's shoulder and turned to leave, but Zhang Yu suddenly called out, "Teacher..."

Director Gao looked back. "Hm?"

Zhang Yu said, "At this year's Ten Greats League, I'll use Civil Engineering skills to defeat my opponents. This time, our Civil Engineering Department will truly shine."

Director Gao's figure stiffened slightly. He replied flatly, "Just focus on the competition and fight however necessary. Don't dwell on such frivolous thoughts."

As he watched the Flying Boat gradually recede into the distance, eventually becoming a tiny black speck, Director Gao thought to himself, "If he hadn't transferred departments..."

"Magnetic Pole?"

Director Gao glanced at True Monarch Magnetic Pole's projection beside him and said, "Since you're here, why not say hello to your student?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied calmly, "You were chatting with him so enthusiastically when I arrived. Besides, I can spend time with my student every day. A few minutes won't matter."

Director Gao opened his mouth to retort but ultimately let out a cold snort and turned to leave.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole chuckled. "Isn't it wonderful to see the Civil Engineering Department shining so brightly? It seems the boy still feels guilty about transferring."

Director Gao paused briefly before continuing, "If he hadn't transferred, he might have truly been held back."

"Zhang Yu needs a broader stage to achieve higher income, accumulate greater wealth, and ultimately generate more profit for us."

"For both him and us, this is the optimal choice."

Meanwhile, aboard the Flying Boat, Zhang Yu watched University City gradually disappear from view.

Within his Bionic Eye, a series of magical artifacts connected to him materialized: the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, twenty-four Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords, the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, and others such as the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill, Earthly Fiend Bottle, Golden Jade Wall, and Sun-Moon Sky-Piercing Bracelet — all brought to ensure he could give his all in the upcoming Ten Greats League.

At the same time, Soul Cultivators Zhao Tianxing, Mo Tianyi, Che Yufei, Hu Yuntao, and the Ying Clan Patriarch had taken refuge within various magical artifacts, accompanying Zhang Yu to the competition arena.

Zhao Tianxing was both excited and nervous: "I never... imagined I'd actually participate in the Ten Greats League someday."

Mo Tianyi mused inwardly: "Finally, I've gained a foothold in the Second Layer. Does this mean I've finally realized my high school dream?"

Che Yufei: "Who else on this ship could have imagined this, besides Zhang Yu?"

Che Yufei sighed: "Shi Yunxiang, who survived, is still working overtime at the construction site, while I, who died bankrupt, get to compete in the Ten Greats League."

Hu Yuntao mused inwardly: "I wonder if news of this will reach the First Layer."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu had already entered the Flying Boat's laboratory, continuing to refine the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor.

---

Even at the Flying Boat's speed, it took a full day and night to reach the competition venue for the Ten Greats League.

Before Zhang Yu, a massive floating island loomed, drifting silently in mid-air like a vast continent.

This aerial landmass boasted mountains, rivers, hills, and mountain ranges, creating a complete miniature world.

Zhang Yu knew that several universities had jointly constructed this arena specifically for the Ten Greats League.

The floating continent was not only vast enough for the Heavenly Chosen of various universities to freely showcase their skills without causing damage, but it also eliminated concerns about destroying property and facing compensation claims.

After consulting the map, Zhang Yu instructed the Flying Boat's pilot to head toward the rendezvous point provided by True Monarch Tranquility, located in the northern part of the floating continent.

Even from a distance, Zhang Yu could see a towering mountain peak piercing the sky like a sharp sword. Various Flying Boats and palaces hovered around its slopes, emanating Spirit Realm messages from various universities, Teachers, and Students — clearly the participants of the Ten Greats League.

Yet even from this distance, Zhang Yu could sense two overwhelming surges of Magic Power being recklessly unleashed.

With a leap, he activated the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power and rushed toward the commotion. There, he saw two groups locked in a tense standoff.

One side was led by Dao Qiankun, comprising students from Myriad Laws, Vajra, Heavenly Sword, and other prestigious universities. Zhang Yu noticed Bai Zhenzhen among them.

The other side was led by a woman, flanked by representatives from Heavenly Demon, Netherworld, White Bone, and other universities.

Staring at the woman leading the group, Zhang Yu froze momentarily. "Kuang Tianqing is supposed to be the strongest from Heavenly Demon, the one who could rival Dao Qiankun. Who is this woman...?"

In the next instant, the Spirit Realm information radiating from her body made Zhang Yu realize: "This woman is Kuang Tianqing?"

Dao Qiankun, observing the woman before him, seemed to voice Zhang Yu's own confusion: "Kuang Tianqing, have you taken up the Dual Cultivation Dao?"

Kuang Tianqing sneered coldly. "I merely sought further advancement. I attended special tutoring at Joyful Union University, receiving instruction from eight Divine Monarchs across the Four Great Colleges. I have mastered the essence of their techniques."

Under the astonished and envious gazes of the university students, she suddenly laughed, then declared condescendingly: "Immortal Scum, would any of you like to cultivate with me?"

"If you surrender and forfeit your competition slots, I might consider accompanying you in a cultivation session."

Her coquettish laughter sent tremors through the students' minds, stirring irresistible desires within their hearts.
