# Chapter 125: Pants All Torn

Gazing at Le Mulan inside the training room, Zhang Yu was at a loss for words.

"How are you going to fight dressed like that?"

At this moment, Le Mulan was swaddled in several layers of clothing, with thick gloves on her hands and a mask on her face, giving her a bulky appearance.

_She's sick,_ Zhang Yu cursed inwardly. _This mysophobia is way too severe._

And so, Zhang Yu said, "I disinfected when I entered the school. You don't have to be so dramatic, do you?"

Le Mulan waved her hand and said, "It won't affect anything. Let's begin."

After two months of training, Le Mulan believed her tolerance for Zhang Yu had improved by leaps and bounds.

But with two months having passed since their last sparring session, she still decided it was best to ease back into it—for instance, by starting with a few extra layers of clothes.

Zhang Yu shook his head helplessly, but she was, after all, a client paying twelve thousand an hour. He naturally had to agree to any strange requests she had.

_Ah, being rich is the best,_ Zhang Yu thought. _Hiring a genius high school boy like me as a sparring partner._

Le Mulan said, "Let's start with a normal fight. Try your best to drag me into a ground fight."

A few moments later, the two stood facing each other. As Le Mulan took a deep breath and beckoned to him, Zhang Yu charged forward ferociously.

With a series of explosive bangs, Le Mulan's sword qi and Zhang Yu's astral qi violently collided.

Le Mulan felt a terrifyingly immense force, suffused with vast mana, slam into her.

She was already weaker than Zhang Yu in terms of raw strength, and her body, bundled in multiple layers of clothing, was a beat slower. Zhang Yu's assault forced her into a steady retreat, and in an instant, he was within a meter of her.

The world spun around her, and with a loud thud, Le Mulan found herself thrown to the ground.

Then, she saw a pair of large hands reaching for her.

Watching Zhang Yu's large hands extend toward her, an instinctive look of disgust flashed across Le Mulan's face, and a silent 'Ugh~' seemed to echo in her mind.

She hurriedly raised her own hands to resist.

Although Le Mulan had learned many close-combat, grappling, and wrestling techniques over the past two months, she was still utterly powerless against Zhang Yu.

Seeing him lock her hands and his legs about to entangle her own, Le Mulan frowned and said, "Stop! Stop! Stop it!"

Zhang Yu stopped with a helpless look on his face and asked, "What is it now?"

Le Mulan quickly stood up, thinking to herself, _Just as I thought… I can tolerate it for a bit, but it's still so disgusting… a pauper's body._

But Le Mulan knew she had sought out Zhang Yu precisely to overcome this mental weakness and to be able to switch between her heart arts more freely.

Yet the thought of his pauper hands touching her all over during a fight filled her with an unbearable sense of nausea.

Especially after seeing Zhang Yu’s daily social media posts, she vividly remembered those hands touching all sorts of grimy bottles and jars, touching river water, touching food from roadside stalls, and touching Bai Zhenzhen…

_A pauper’s hands reaching out to touch me everywhere… This is so much more unbearable than the simple hand-to-hand contact last time._

_Indeed… I have to take this one step at a time._

So, after some thought, she said, "Next, you will defend with all your strength. I will try to control you in a ground fight, and you are not allowed to proactively attack me with your hands."

Zhang Yu nodded casually, thinking that the pay was the same no matter how they trained.

The next moment, the two were on the ground again, but this time it was Le Mulan on the offensive.

She reached out, wrapping her arms around Zhang Yu from behind and locking her hands toward his neck.

Her legs continuously tried to scissor around his thighs and abdomen.

But in the face of his strength, she felt as if she were trying to restrain a great dragon; a terrifying power coiled and surged between them, constantly resisting her control.

Compared to two months ago, the strength of both had grown to a point where they were in different leagues entirely.

Under the transmission of their combined force, even the high-quality fabric of Le Mulan’s clothes let out a ripping sound.

The several layers of pants she wore shredded one by one in their struggle, revealing a pair of long, fair, and powerful legs.

Zhang Yu's pants fared no better, and were similarly torn to pieces.

As they grappled, Zhang Yu could feel Le Mulan's thigh pressing and rubbing against his own. The cold, subtle sensation of their skin touching was a momentary distraction.

After all, this was completely different from his previous close encounters with a client (Song Hailong).

Le Mulan, also feeling the flesh of her thigh against Zhang Yu’s, had an expression of disgust so palpable it was almost a physical entity, and her legs subconsciously tried to shift away.

But this movement immediately created an opening for Zhang Yu to break free. Le Mulan hastily reminded herself, _Endure! You must endure! You must overcome this psychological weakness!_

Fortunately, Zhang Yu was also distracted. Not only did he fail to break free, but Le Mulan found an opportunity.

At this moment, Le Mulan's hands were hooked around Zhang Yu's neck while her legs were coiled around his waist. With a surge of power from her long, strong thigh muscles, she was like a great python, tearing a large chunk of Zhang Yu’s shirt to shreds with a rip.

Feeling the flesh of her thighs pressed tightly against Zhang Yu's waist and abdomen, Le Mulan felt as if she were clamping her legs around a bag of garbage.

However, despite the revulsion in her eyes, she ultimately persevered and endured it.

Yet in the next moment, as Zhang Yu blocked her chokehold with one hand, his other hand reached for her thigh, intending to break her leg-lock.

With a slap, his hand landed on the flesh of her thigh.

Le Mulan's physical body was incredibly strong; when she exerted her power, her skin and flesh were definitely harder than ordinary bricks and stones.

But at this moment, under the immense power of Zhang Yu's hand, Le Mulan's thigh suddenly felt fleshy, sinking in slightly with his squeeze.

It was this very squeeze that caused Le Mulan's body to tense up abruptly, as if it were about to go completely rigid.

_His hand…_

In that instant, a series of images flashed through Le Mulan's mind like a revolving lantern, all scenes she had seen on his social media feed.

This was the hand that had touched public buses, ridden the subway, grabbed synthetic food, used the bathrooms at Songyang High School, a hand brimming with a pauper’s genes, a hand that had touched that other pauper, Bai Zhenzhen, countless times…

And now, it was squeezing her thigh?

The nightmare from the arena two months ago seemed to surge through Le Mulan's mind once more, clashing violently with the heart art in her thoughts.

Le Mulan bit her lip hard, feeling the spot on her thigh ache more and more from the pressure, fighting to keep the tears from falling.

As for Zhang Yu… while he was defending against Le Mulan’s assault, he noticed the fragrance in the air growing stronger and stronger.

_What’s that smell?_

It wasn't until Le Mulan locked him in another chokehold and his face became slick with a layer of sweat from her arm that he understood.

_What the hell! Is Le Mulan’s sweat… fragrant?_

_No… something's not right. This sweat seems to be…_

As their struggle intensified, Zhang Yu's body temperature rose rapidly, making Le Mulan feel as if she were grappling with a red-hot poker; her legs, chest, and abdomen grew hotter and hotter.

And although Le Mulan's body remained cool to the touch, Zhang Yu could feel a constant secretion of sweat from her hands, wetting his entire face.

_This isn't sweat at all. It reeks of medicine… This has to be Purple Cloud Supplements!_

_Is it because of that super-metabolism surgery? Does it excrete the medicinal residue from her body as sweat?_

Inhaling the medicinal scent emanating from her body, Zhang Yu felt the qi and blood in his own body surge ever more violently, and his neural responses began to grow excited.

_This is bad. Who knows what kind of potent drugs this medicine pot of a girl has in her system? I can't let it affect me…_

Zhang Yu knew that if a master from the drug-using faction were here, they might even lick it to taste the ingredients.

As a proponent of natural body tempering, Zhang Yu would never consume drugs recklessly. He quickly clamped his mouth shut and held his breath, trying his best to avoid being affected by the sweat on Le Mulan's body.

As the sweat covered Le Mulan's entire body, particularly her thighs, it gradually took on a greasy feeling, making Zhang Yu's hand feel slippery…

The next moment, having finally gained complete control of Zhang Yu, Le Mulan felt a surge of joy. _I've finally locked him down!_

However, the instant after her success, she released him like a bolt of lightning and, with a whoosh, rolled back more than ten meters away.

Zhang Yu lay on the ground, his face flushed red. On the floor was a large, vaguely human-shaped puddle of sweat, still emitting wisps of steam.

Le Mulan asked, "Why couldn't you exert any strength at the end? You weren't holding back, were you?"

Zhang Yu shot her an irritated glance and said, "You sweat way too much. Your legs and hands were so slippery and greasy, and that smell was everywhere. I had to hold my breath the whole time."

As he spoke, Zhang Yu's gaze swept over Le Mulan. He saw that although her top was somewhat damaged, it was mostly fine, still covering the majority of her body.

In contrast, the pants on her long, straight legs had been almost completely shredded in the fight, and a large, dark handprint was visible on her right thigh.

Seeing the handprint, Zhang Yu asked, a little embarrassed, "Is your leg okay?"

Le Mulan was still pondering what Zhang Yu had just said. Hearing his question, she glanced at the bruise on her leg and said nonchalantly, "It's just a minor injury. My body has its own healing agents; it will recover in a little while."

"What you just said, why did you have to hold your breath?" Le Mulan asked, puzzled. "The super-metabolism surgery gives me an exceptionally strong ability to absorb and break down supplements."

"And I use only the highest-grade elixirs daily. After I absorb them, the liquid excreted from my skin… is residue to me, but for ordinary students, it perfectly meets normal drinking standards, non-toxic and with no side effects."

"You could even drink it directly, so there's no need to hold your breath."

"However…" Le Mulan said with a frown, "you are not to touch me with your tongue."

Zhang Yu raged internally. _You have got to be kidding me… I’m a practitioner of natural body tempering! Who gives a damn about your medicinal residue!_
