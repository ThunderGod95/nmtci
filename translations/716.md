# Chapter 716: Contacting the Ten Universities, Quasi Soul Transformation?

Inside the Research Association, Ye Xingli silently worked on her assigned tasks for the day.

Ever since Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole brought her into the Research Association's experimental team, Ye Xingli had diligently worked and studied, absorbing artifact refinement knowledge like a sponge.

However, as Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and the other Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs waged war on the Kunxu Fifth Layer, the Research Association's workload gradually decreased.

Initially, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole could remotely assign tasks and oversee the Research Association and laboratory through the Spirit Realm Network.

But with the firmament of the Fourth and Fifth Layers sealing again, the Spirit Realm Network was severed. The Research Association and laboratory completely lost Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's guidance, becoming somewhat leaderless.

Especially as Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs began disappearing from the Fifth Layer's battlefield, the Ten Great Universities descended into chaos, and the Research Association's atmosphere grew increasingly oppressive.

A sense of impending crisis filled the air, like a storm brewing over a tall building.

Ye Xingli could sense her colleagues' minds drifting from their work, their discussions increasingly focused on whether to hold their ground or evacuate.

Just then, a wave of complaints arose.

True Monarch Nine Refinements exclaimed angrily, "Why has our budget been cut again?"

Ye Xingli knew that True Monarch Nine Refinements had once been an elite instructor. After the Great Upheaval, he had smoothly advanced from Golden Core True Person to Nascent Soul True Monarch and, having earned the favor of True Monarch Magnetic Pole, was recruited into the laboratory to conduct cutting-edge research on Spatial Technology.

Yet now, True Monarch Nine Refinements wore an expression of deep dissatisfaction, and not merely because the Research Association had slashed their funding and supplies once more.

If it were merely a matter of cuts, the cultivators, including True Monarch Nine Refinements, wouldn't be so disgruntled, considering the current state of the war.

But when they compared their meager resources to the lavish, even excessive, supplies allocated to Zhang Yu's team, it was difficult for them to accept the situation.

Of course, Zhang Yu was Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's disciple, so Ye Xingli knew they wouldn't dare voice their complaints openly. But she was certain their hearts were filled with silent resentment.

True Monarch Nine Refinements, a doctoral graduate of Myriad Laws University's Artifact Refinement Department, had achieved Golden Core at the age of fifty, successfully remained at the university, and steadily climbed the ranks to the Research Association's laboratory. His path had been one of meteoric ascent, making him a true Heavenly Chosen of Myriad Laws.

Yet, thinking of Zhang Yu's treatment next door, he still felt a surge of resentment: "Now is the critical moment for the survival of the Ten Great Universities! Our laboratory's research into Spatial Technology is the most vital and crucial technology, the most likely place to turn the tide of the war."

"Shouldn't they be pouring resources into top-tier laboratories like ours, urging us to break through in Spatial Technology? Even at this critical juncture, they're still cutting funding and prioritizing the cultivation of Soul Transformation disciples..."

Recalling how the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation Experts had been defeated due to infighting over battlefield gains, True Monarch Nine Refinements couldn't help but sigh: "The culture of the Ten Great Universities is rotten to the core. Money and resources can't flow to where they're most needed. Their defeat was well-deserved."

Just then, everyone present received a message from True Monarch String Tone.

As the Department Head of Artifact Refinement at Myriad Laws University, True Monarch String Tone also held a position within the Research Association. When Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole was absent, he served as the acting administrator of the laboratory.

Upon reading the message from True Monarch String Tone, the group exchanged puzzled glances.

One of them wondered aloud, "Prepare the assembly hall? Is someone coming to inspect the Research Association's work? Who would visit at this late hour?"

True Monarch Nine Refinements sighed inwardly. "We have to go to the Research Association's main gate? Are we welcoming someone? This is absurd. At a time like this, they're still indulging in such formalities."

Ye Xingli frowned slightly. "Everyone has to go? Even those with urgent tasks?"

Someone exclaimed in shock, "Stop working to go? What's going on?"

Putting aside one's work... At Myriad Laws University, this was an absolute top-priority directive. Since enrolling, Ye Xingli had never encountered such a demand to abandon her current tasks. Even during the principal's inspections, such a requirement had never been imposed.

The group hurried to the main gate, but after waiting for over half an hour, nothing happened.

True Monarch Nine Refinements shook his head repeatedly, his heart heavy with despair. "I fear both Myriad Laws and the Ten Great Universities are beyond saving..."

Just then, banners formed by Spirit Realm Projections lit up, displaying the message: "Warmly welcome True Monarch Blazing Light! Your guidance is the driving force behind our progress."

Moments later, a group of figures descended from the sky in the distance.

"True Monarch String Tone, True Monarch North Sea, True Monarch Silent Abyss, True Monarch Ember Lamp, True Monarch Thunder Pole..."

True Monarch Nine Refinements was stunned as he recognized the names of these True Monarchs from the Artifact Refinement Department.

These Nascent Soul True Monarchs, revered figures in the artifact refining world, renowned for their virtue, wealth, and influence, were all gathered around a single person.

That individual moved with the authority of an emperor inspecting his domain, slowly descending toward the Research Association's entrance, accompanied by the department leaders of the Artifact Refinement Department.

"Zhang Yu!" True Monarch Nine Refinements exclaimed in astonishment. "He's the one we've been waiting for?"

Zhang Yu glanced at the crowd gathered at the entrance, then smiled at True Monarch String Tone beside him. "True Monarch, did you arrange this?"

True Monarch String Tone smiled. "True Monarch Blazing Light, your upcoming plan requires the collective effort of all faculty and students across the entire university, indeed, all ten universities. The Research Association is the starting point. I thought it best for them to receive your guidance first, so they understand what needs to be done."

Zhang Yu nodded. "Perfect. I was planning to convene a meeting with everyone at the Research Association anyway. We might as well seize this opportunity."

The group was led to a conference room True Monarch String Tone had already prepared, where Zhang Yu began explaining the Heaven-Piercing Plan.

"The magical artifact I've designed is called the Heaven-Piercing Cone."

"The core concept behind the Heaven-Piercing Cone is to enable every person in Kunxu — whether from the Vocational College, the Upper and Lower Schools, or the Ten Universities, whether human or monsterfolk — to wield it and pierce the firmament..."

"Mass production of the Heaven-Piercing Cones will begin in numerous factories soon. Your role will be to guide these factories, assisting them in establishing and adjusting their production lines..."

The audience below was stunned by Zhang Yu's rapid-fire announcements, their minds reeling.

"The Heaven-Piercing Cone? Designed by Zhang Yu?" True Monarch Nine Refinements, like many cultivators from the Research Association, instinctively felt disbelief.

But as they examined the design blueprints and listened to Zhang Yu's explanations, their shock only deepened.

"We're so far behind..." True Monarch Nine Refinements murmured inwardly. "We're worlds apart from Zhang Yu. How did he even conceive of this design?"

"And this familiar style... it's clearly the True Inheritance of Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole..."

True Monarch Nine Refinements stared intently at the design blueprint projected from his Bionic Eye, the widening gap between their capabilities filling him with despair.

He had originally believed that his work at the Research Association, in the laboratory established by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, placed him at the forefront of spatial technology research.

But now, as he studied Zhang Yu's design blueprint, he felt as if he had been struck by lightning, awakening from a dream.

"The cost reduction is staggering... The spatial unlocking mechanism is utterly miraculous... How did this guy even come up with this?"

With each page he examined, True Monarch Nine Refinements felt his despair deepen, making his years of artifact refinement seem utterly futile.

Ye Xingli, too, watched Zhang Yu on the stage with surprise. This former Junior Brother had unknowingly grown to a height that now made her look up to him.

Meanwhile, True Monarch String Tone listened to Zhang Yu's explanation from the audience, inwardly marveling, "Zhang Yu's plan involves producing a massive quantity of Heaven-Piercing Cones, which will then be activated simultaneously by a large number of cultivators to breach the Fourth and Fifth Layers of the firmament."

True Monarch String Tone understood that if this plan succeeded, it would not only support the Soul Transformation experts and potentially turn the tide of the war, but also unlock immense profits.

"Who will manufacture these massive quantities of Heaven-Piercing Cones? Who will handle their distribution? The various components, subcontracting, assembly, and distribution channels... all represent vast fortunes in Spirit Coins."

The power to distribute these massive profits lay entirely in Zhang Yu's hands.

True Monarch String Tone thought to himself, "Zhang Yu's mastery of Spatial Technology is likely unmatched among the Ten Universities. He created the design blueprint for the Heaven-Piercing Cone, and only he can modify it. Everything depends on his sole decision."

"With a mere flick of his finger, he can determine the profit distribution of the Heaven-Piercing Cone, deciding the life or death of countless companies and factories."

"This is the absolute power granted to him by his mastery of cutting-edge Immortal Dao Technology."

When the meeting concluded and Zhang Yu returned to his Meditation Chamber, he found a complete set of Bionics laid out before him.

"From head to toe, including bones, internal organs, meridians, Dantian, nervous system, and more — a total of 333 Level 40 Bionics."

Zhang Yu knew that as a cultivator's Cultivation Realm and Magic Power increased, the number of Bionics they could equip also grew exponentially.

By the Nascent Soul Cultivator stage, Bionics had been miniaturized to the point where every tiny bone, meridian segment, and even strand of hair could be replaced with a complete Bionic.

However, Zhang Yu had only recently broken through to the Nascent Soul Realm and was preoccupied with cultivation and advancing his Immortal Sect Technique, leaving him no time to acquire Bionics.

Especially... if he were to refine his entire flesh and blood into a custom-made Bionic, it would be akin to using his physical body as raw material to forge a magical artifact. To do so... he would have no time left to cultivate Immortal Sect Daoist Arts.

The 333 level 40 Bionics sent by True Monarch String Tone, though not custom-made, were all high-quality general-purpose Bionics. The vast majority were of top-tier corporate-grade standards, while a few were even military-grade Bionics from the Artifact Refinement Department.

Zhang Yu had long possessed the certification for military-grade Bionic magical artifacts. The value of these 333 level 40 Bionics was comparable to the total assets of many small companies.

This was a natural consequence of the exponential growth in wealth as cultivators advanced through the Immortal Dao Realm and their cultivation levels increased.

Zhang Yu flipped through the user manuals for the entire set of 333 Bionics.

The complete set, named Platinum Emperor, primarily enhanced two fundamental attributes of Nascent Soul Cultivators: physical strength and Magic Power capacity. The remaining capabilities, such as invisibility, flight, martial arts integration, Talisman integration, and Spirit Realm defense, were not Zhang Yu's primary focus.

"The enhancement to my foundational stats is exactly what I need right now."

The Platinum Emperor's boost to foundational stats is particularly effective for cultivators whose physical strength and Magic Power haven't reached the Nascent Soul Realm's limits.

Even after a cultivator's foundational stats reach the Nascent Soul Realm's limits, the Platinum Emperor can still provide further enhancements, though the effects become less pronounced. It can help cultivators slightly surpass the Nascent Soul Realm's limits.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "This is a Bionic that can be used from the early Nascent Soul Realm all the way to the Nascent Soul Peak."

Of course, Zhang Yu didn't plan to use this Bionic constantly. He still needed to temper his physical body, so he intended to use it only when necessary.

Next, Zhang Yu turned his attention to the items sent by True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter and the others.

"A level 40 armor?"

The armor sent by True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, in Zhang Yu's opinion, resembled a miniature mecha. In terms of size, it was much bulkier than Iron Man's armor but considerably slimmer than a Gundam.

The Heaven-Shattering War God Armor, as it was called, was a complete set of military-grade armor specifically designed for combat, also known as a personal combat platform.

The armor itself possessed not only astonishing defensive capabilities, but could also be equipped with various magical artifacts, connected to different Bionics, and even provide the wearer with additional Magic Power output.

Zhang Yu mentally calculated that if he donned the Platinum Emperor armor and then wore the Heaven-Shattering War God Armor, his Magic Power reserves would likely temporarily surge to 80,000, far exceeding his current level of 38,000.

In peacetime, the price of this armor might not even match that of the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

But during wartime, Zhang Yu believed the Heaven-Shattering War God Armor was no less valuable than the Platinum Emperor armor on the other side, equivalent to the total assets of several small companies.

Zhang Yu couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "This is Kunxu. As long as you have money and power, there are endless ways to enhance your combat prowess."

Observing True Monarch String Tone and True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter presenting their gifts in succession, Zhang Yu naturally understood their intentions.

"True Monarch String Tone represents Teacher Magnetic Pole's faction and the Artifact Refinement Department. These are the talents I'll inevitably need to execute my plans, my core foundation. I can't afford to treat them poorly."

"True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter and True Monarch Miraculous Hand represent the original withdrawal faction. Having just been subdued, they need to be properly appeased..."

As Zhang Yu pondered this, Tu Lishan approached with a gift: a complete set of level 40 Seven Absolutes Bionics.

While Zhang Yu was speaking with Tu Lishan, he noticed new messages from Yu Xinghan, Bei Wufeng, Ying Xin, and others.

Artifact Refinement Department, Security Department, Medical Department, Civil Engineering Department, his own company, his own laboratory...

At that moment, Zhang Yu felt like he had suddenly become the head of a large family, with each child clamoring for milk, each with their own valid reasons, emotional appeals, and justifications...

He could only repeatedly allocate resources, ensuring the Heaven-Piercing Plan would proceed smoothly.

Just then, Zhang Yu received a message from True Monarch String Tone.

"We offered them the Heaven-Piercing Cone's copyright for free, but they refused?"

"Heavenly Demon University thinks it's a scam?"

"Netherworld University believes the Research Association is using this as an excuse to request more funding?"

"Immortal Armaments University wants us to provide the blueprints directly for their review before agreeing?"

"Still no response from Celestial Monsters University?"

Seeing the responses from the other nine universities, Zhang Yu couldn't help but laugh in anger. "Damn it... a bunch of vermin."

Just then, True Monarch String Tone advised, "True Monarch Blazing Light, I understand you're considering the bigger picture, but the idea of not making a profit is simply unacceptable to most people. It goes against common sense and public morality, and will inevitably invite criticism and suspicion..."

Zhang Yu nodded. "I understand. Then tell them it's a free trial version. If the trial version works well, we'll charge them later..."

But the next moment, Zhang Yu shook his head. "Why should we make it sound like we're begging them?"

"They should be the ones coming to us, and the sooner, the better."

Looking up at the Soul Transformation Battlefield in the sky, Zhang Yu knew that every delay could lead to more unpredictable variables.

With this in mind, Zhang Yu's gaze shifted. "True Monarch String Tone, please arrange for the Research Association's relocation."

True Monarch String Tone asked in surprise, "Relocation?"

Zhang Yu nodded. "Yes. Leak the news to them that I'm withdrawing the Research Association and moving everything back to Myriad Laws."

True Monarch String Tone immediately understood. Zhang Yu intended to use this false information to quickly draw the Ten Universities' experts to them.

Heavenly Demon University.

True Monarch Precise Attainment is currently one of the ruling cultivators at Heavenly Demon University, responsible for external communications and investments.

In his youth, a fortune-teller had predicted he would become a king, but True Monarch Precise Attainment dismissed it.

Later, he entered the courier industry and gradually built a company that spanned the second to fifth layers of Kunxu. Only then did he realize the fortune-teller had been right — he was indeed destined to become a man who would unleash a storm in the courier world.

After the Great Void Cloud Repository emerged, he actively embraced new technologies, becoming one of the first courier companies to adopt Spatial Technology, once again placing himself at the forefront of the era.

Unlike the self-reliance faction represented by Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, True Monarch Precise Attainment had always advocated for collaboration over independent development within Heavenly Demon University.

But now, as the Soul Transformation War gradually turned against them, the skies of the fourth and fifth layers seemed to collapse, pressing down on True Monarch Precise Attainment's heart with anxiety. The on-time delivery rates of his company plummeted daily, and even his employees struggled to focus on their work.

It was under these circumstances that he received a message from the Research Association.

"Zhang Yu? He wants us to help him break through the firmament? And he's offering the patent rights to his magical artifacts for free?"

Zhang Yu, a cultivator who had only recently broken through to the Nascent Soul Realm, claiming to possess a plan to shatter the firmament? True Monarch Precise Attainment naturally didn't believe it.

The offer to freely provide the copyright for a magical artifact only deepened True Monarch Precise Attainment's suspicions.

"Is this a scam targeting me?"

Especially considering the recent cuts to the Research Association's funding from Heavenly Demon University, True Monarch Precise Attainment grew increasingly convinced that this was a deliberate ploy to swindle funds.

After all, he had witnessed countless similar schemes over the years: fabricating grand projects as a pretext to siphon funds.

But soon, True Monarch Precise Attainment received new intelligence.

"Zhang Yu is organizing a team to empty the Research Association?"

Upon seeing this, True Monarch Precise Attainment erupted in fury.

The Research Association was jointly funded by the Ten Universities, with Heavenly Demon University contributing the lion's share. How could he possibly allow Zhang Yu to pilfer its assets and claim them for himself?

"Unable to scam funding, he resorts to outright theft?"

"Very well, Magnetic Pole is gone, and no Soul Transformation expert protects you now. Does Zhang Yu still think everyone will defer to him?"

True Monarch Precise Attainment immediately contacted Zhang Yu, projecting his Spirit Realm Projection into the cultivator's office.

True Monarch Precise Attainment glared at Zhang Yu, who sat calmly in his office chair. "Zhang Yu, how dare you! Who gave you the authority to seize the Research Association's assets?"

Zhang Yu didn't argue. He simply replied, "Please wait a moment. I'll explain everything once the others arrive."

Precise Attainment's gaze swept the room, noting that besides himself and Zhang Yu, True Monarch String Tone of Myriad Laws University and representatives from Immortal Armaments University and Vajra University were already present.

Just then, a flash of spiritual light materialized another projection before Zhang Yu — True Monarch Heavenly Struggle from Netherworld University.

This True Monarch was renowned as the highest-paid Nascent Soul cultivator among the Ten Universities, his work ethic, wealth-generating abilities, and cultivation level widely admired by his peers.

True Monarch Heavenly Struggle wasted no time. "I've reviewed the Research Association's accounts for the past few months and found glaring irregularities," he declared.

He fixed Zhang Yu with a cold stare. "Blazing Light, you've been repeatedly diverting experimental funds for your personal cultivation, purchasing vast quantities of Immortal Dao materials unrelated to your projects. The scale and variety of these acquisitions are truly shocking."

"Such blatant misuse of the Ten Universities' resources is utterly audacious!"

"Everyone," True Monarch Heavenly Struggle said loudly, addressing the representatives from the other universities, "I believe we should immediately expel Zhang Yu, recover the embezzled resources, and entrust the Research Association to a more reliable, wealthier, and more powerful cultivator."

The university representatives nodded in agreement.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Precise Attainment had been added to a small group chat. Upon joining, he saw that representatives from all universities except Myriad Laws University were already present.

The representative from Immortal Armaments University stated directly, "Everyone, such a crucial position within the Research Association should no longer be haphazardly controlled by Myriad Laws University."

The representative from Vajra University said, "Expelling Zhang Yu and String Tone is fine, but who will lead the Research Association after they're gone?"

The representative from White Bone University suggested, "Let's just dissolve it. I don't see the point in continuing the Research Association. We can simply divide the remaining resources among ourselves and be done with it..."

True Monarch Precise Attainment quickly scanned the chat history and realized the representatives had conflicting agendas. Some wanted their own people to lead the Research Association, others wanted to withdraw funding entirely, while still others remained neutral, waiting for others to offer them benefits...

After True Monarch Precise Attainment also expressed his intention to manage the Research Association, True Monarch Heavenly Struggle pulled him into another small group, where everyone was plotting to seize control of the association.

True Monarch Heavenly Struggle declared, "First, let's drive out Myriad Laws. We can discuss how to divide the management rights later."

Instantly, tens of thousands of messages flooded the small group, exchanged at breakneck speed.

As Vajra, Heavenly Sword, Heavenly Demon, and Netherworld formed their own alliances, True Monarch Precise Attainment was pulled into a separate group exclusively for Heavenly Demon and Netherworld.

The exchanges, disputes, and bargaining continued relentlessly.

True Monarch Precise Attainment actively participated in the schemes, regarding Zhang Yu beside him as nothing more than meat on a chopping block, unworthy of further attention.

Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye twitched slightly as he observed the projections frantically flashing with signal lights. He thought to himself, "They're probably plotting how to seize power and profit, aren't they?"

"This is Kunxu... Even as the great edifice crumbles, even until the very moment of its destruction, the endless struggle for power and profit will never cease."

Seeing that the representatives from all Ten Universities had arrived, Zhang Yu slowly extended a finger. In the next moment, Spirit Realm Projections cascaded down around them.

His current assets, stocks, funds, copyrights, and patents materialized one by one.

These included not only his personal wealth but also the fruits of the power transfer he had received from Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood before their departure.

As True Monarch Precise Attainment gazed at the terrifying expanse of Zhang Yu's financial empire, his expression grew increasingly shocked. "How can he be so wealthy? How could Zhang Yu possibly possess such vast wealth? This is no longer wealth that a Nascent Soul Cultivator could control... This is wealth that only a Soul Transformation Expert could command!"

True Monarch Heavenly Struggle now looked at Zhang Yu, his gaze completely devoid of the slightest contempt, replaced by pure respect. "With assets of this scale, Zhang Yu can already be considered... a Quasi Soul Transformation Expert!"

Noticing the respectful gazes of the university representatives, Zhang Yu spoke slowly, "Esteemed representatives, what I am about to say concerns the very survival of your universities. It will determine whether you end up bankrupt or remain wealthy individuals. I urge you to listen carefully."
