# Chapter 526: Zhang Yu's Bottom Line

"True Monarch Magnetic Pole doesn't fully understand laboratory management, school property security, or the nature of our work," Feng Yuhuan said. "But I can't ignore her oversights."

As Feng Yuhuan spoke, Zhang Yu's consciousness pierced through the layers of the Spirit Realm, directly entering the Supreme Clarity Realm.

Sensing this, Zhang Yu was astonished. "The Supreme Clarity Realm can bypass the blockade? My sister's Dao Seed is truly unfathomable."

Initially, Zhang Yu had believed the Great Purity Talisman was as powerful as Bai Zhenzhen's Azure Lotus Sword Embryo. Now, he increasingly felt that the talisman's potential far surpassed even the sword embryo's terrifying power.

"Hmm?" Zhang Pianpian's eyes snapped open in the grand hall. "You've been blocked?"

After Zhang Yu explained the situation, she chuckled softly. "No need to contact anyone. Just return directly."

"Shouldn't we inform True Monarch Magnetic Pole about this?" Zhang Yu asked, puzzled.

"What kind of person do you think Magnetic Pole is?" Zhang Pianpian replied. "Feng Yuhuan has been watching her laboratory like a hawk. How could she not anticipate this move?"

"The moment your Sun-Moon Sky-Piercing Bracelet lost contact, she likely noticed. She's probably already observing you and Feng Yuhuan from the shadows."

"If you use the Supreme Clarity Realm as a channel to report this now, you'll reveal your trump card."

"Just go back."

High in the sky, Director Gao gazed down at Zhang Yu and Feng Yuhuan below, sighing, "Magnetic Pole, aren't you going to intervene? How long do you plan to watch?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "Isn't this a perfect opportunity to test our disciple's mettle?"

Director Gao shook his head. "You're too fond of testing human nature. It can't withstand such trials."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole chuckled. "How can I trust someone who hasn't endured rigorous trials?"

"Of course, I know everything in this world has a price."

"Only by understanding a person's psychological price point can I confidently utilize them."

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu regained his senses, Feng Yuhuan's voice reached his ears again.

"Once you entrust your vital organ to my safekeeping, True Monarch Magnetic Pole can apply to me for experimental use."

"And as I said, this is a good thing for you."

With that, 300 Spirit Coins materialized at Feng Yuhuan's fingertips, causing profound celestial phenomena to manifest.

"The school is willing to pay 300 Spirit Coins to acquire the full rights to your organ."

After saying this, Feng Yuhuan's face was filled with confidence.

He believed that no Foundation Establishment student would refuse 300 Spirit Coins for their organ.

As Zhang Yu gazed at the celestial phenomena triggered by the 300 Spirit Coins — the balance flickering in the air and the murmurs of Soul Cultivators echoing from the depths of the Spirit Realm — he felt a moment of hesitation.

Especially since he was about to begin refining the prototype machine for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, a project that would require significant funding.

Although he had received some project support from the Artifact Refinement Department recently, Zhang Yu had simultaneously mastered ten artifact refinement techniques, which had drained his resources. His bank account now held only fifty-odd Spirit Coins.

With the additional 300 Spirit Coins, his upcoming plans would undoubtedly be greatly facilitated.

Feng Yuhuan said calmly, "You don't need to worry about losing access to the experiments after handing over the organ."

"I'll store them. Whenever you and True Monarch Magnetic Pole wish to conduct experiments, simply submit an advance request to me."

"As the laboratory's property security officer, I hope you understand, Student Yu..."

Zhang Yu firmly shook his head. "I won't sell it unless Teacher approves."

Feng Yuhuan frowned. "You recently applied for a project loan from the school, didn't you? The project description seems to be a prototype machine for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God?"

"Your loan application arrived in my office yesterday."

"But if you refuse to cooperate with our work, I don't think you deserve the school's loan."

Faced with this threat, Zhang Yu shook his head again. "Teacher guided me step by step to where I am today. Every piece of flesh and blood on my body belongs to him. I won't sell any of it without his consent."

High above.

Hearing Zhang Yu's words, True Monarch Magnetic Pole burst into laughter and turned to Director Gao beside her. "Old Gao, what do you think?"

Director Gao's expression was complex. "It seems he truly adores his Master."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole countered, "I suspect this kid is putting on a show. Could he have guessed we were nearby?"

Director Gao sighed. "Magnetic Pole, you're too suspicious. It's time to act."

In the next instant, as Director Gao unleashed a palm strike, the terrifying Earthly Fiend Gravity surged like boiling water.

Zhang Yu felt everything before him violently stretch, twist, and distort, as if the entire world were being dragged into a massive void.

"This is... Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power?" Zhang Yu thought in shock. "Golden Core level? No, this is at least Nascent Soul level Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power!"

Under the heavily distorted sunlight caused by the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, the world seemed to darken.

Simultaneously, the chains Feng Yuhuan had just deployed shattered into pieces.

Feng Yuhuan looked up at Director Gao descending from the sky and sneered. "Gao Chongguang, you're meddling in the Artifact Refinement Department's affairs? You spineless fool, are you so willing to be manipulated by Xiao Yurong? Running errands for him?"

Xiao Yurong was True Monarch Magnetic Pole's original name, and this was the first time Zhang Yu had ever heard anyone address his master by it.

Gao Chongguang replied calmly, "Our affairs are none of your concern."

As the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda faintly materialized in the Spirit Realm, Feng Yuhuan scoffed coldly and gradually retreated.

"True Monarch Magnetic Pole, my actions stem from pure public interest."

"With the Ten Greats League approaching and the situation dire for all schools, my approach is the safest course."

As Feng Yuhuan departed, True Monarch Magnetic Pole appeared before Zhang Yu, nodding at him. "Are you alright?"

Before Zhang Yu could even exhale in relief, True Monarch Magnetic Pole continued, "However, Feng Yuhuan's words do carry some truth."

"Joyful Union University has never ceased causing trouble, and they'll likely make moves during the upcoming Ten Greats League."

"For your safety, it's best if you entrust the item to me for safekeeping."

Zhang Yu paused, a troubled expression crossing his face.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole added, "Would I ever let you suffer a loss? If Feng Yuhuan offered you 300 Spirit Coins, I'll match it."

Yet Zhang Yu remained unmoved.

He recalled his arrival in Kunxu, remembering his reaction upon first hearing the condition for enrollment: sterilization.

Back then, Zhang Yu had felt nothing but revulsion for such conditions.

But over the years, under Kunxu's relentless pressure, he had repeatedly lowered his standards, selling off pieces of himself one by one.

First his time, then his labor, then his blood and sweat, then his life seed... Now, was he finally being asked to sell his very organs?

After years of studying, Zhang Yu felt as if he had been transported back to Songyang High School.

The interviewer's question flashed through his mind: "Have you been sterilized?"

This time, Zhang Yu refused to comply.

"For survival, to keep living, I can accept partial assimilation into Kunxu."

"But I refuse to be completely assimilated. I refuse to become a Kunxu person through and through..."

In that moment, a sudden realization struck Zhang Yu. From the moment he had entered high school, the question of sterilization had become an anchor in his heart, a point of distinction that separated him from the native Kunxu.

In his mind, the Four-Headed White Bull roared repeatedly, as if echoing Zhang Yu's resolve.

Zhang Yu raised his head and looked at True Monarch Magnetic Pole. "Master!"

"What need have I for 300 Spirit Coins? Anything on my person that pleases you, Master, is yours to take."

"But I humbly suggest that if you wait until I have mastered body refinement and achieved a breakthrough to the Golden Core or even Nascent Soul Stage, I can offer you something of far greater quality."

Though Zhang Yu had resolved not to let Kunxu breach his final defenses and to maintain his mental anchor, he understood that proper methods were essential.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled and said, "If you don't want it, that's fine."

"Let's head back together."

As they hurried back to University City, True Monarch Magnetic Pole privately messaged Director Gao: This kid refused 300 Spirit Coins just for a root?

Director Gao stroked his chin, a faint smile playing at the corner of his lips. It's been a long time since I've seen a student like this.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole chuckled and replied: You used to be like that too.

Director Gao's expression darkened. Why are you dragging me into this?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: I was just thinking, weren't all the disciples we took in centuries ago like this when they were alive?

After a moment of silence, Director Gao replied: Hmm.

Back at Myriad Laws University City, True Monarch Magnetic Pole grabbed Zhang Yu and headed straight for the laboratory to continue artifact refinement.

Glancing at Director Gao, who was watching them, True Monarch Magnetic Pole asked, "What? Want to come watch?"

Director Gao: "It's just artifact refinement. Nothing to see."

"Then Zhang Yu and I will be off."

With that, True Monarch Magnetic Pole hurried Zhang Yu to the laboratory, leaving Director Gao to silently watch their retreating figures.

Another month passed in the blink of an eye, bringing the calendar to early September.

During this time, Zhang Yu continued to study magical artifact blueprints, propelled by the blessings of the Supreme Clarity Realm and his innate talent as an Artifact Refinement Prodigy. He made rapid progress, unconsciously mastering nearly half of the prerequisite artifact blueprints required for refining the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu watched True Monarch Magnetic Pole use Biomimetic Technology to create the Yang Artifact Bionic. After countless revisions, she finalized the design and systematically advanced the Yang Artifact Bionic to level 30, just one level short of the requirements for replicating a Dao Seed.

Amid these fulfilling days, Zhang Yu sensed a growing tension enveloping University City.

The new season of the Ten Greats League was about to begin.

From Zhang Yu's observations, the conflicts between universities in this year's Ten Greats League seemed more intense than ever before.

Amidst this fierce competition, under the watchful eyes of countless spectators, and with most completely unprepared...

A financial crisis struck.
