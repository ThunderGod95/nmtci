# Chapter 426: Displaying Divine Powers, Breakthroughs in Battle

True Monarch Cloud Haven turned his gaze to Ping Han on the other side, his admiration growing stronger.

On the screen, Ping Han's construction progress far surpassed the others. Channeling his cultivation through the Grand Formation beneath his feet, each palm strike shook the earth and shattered mountains, swallowing swathes of Yellow Turban Warriors whole.

"He has the most resources, the deepest cultivation, and the highest efficiency in civil engineering among all the candidates," True Monarch Cloud Haven remarked. "Old Gao, your Civil Engineering Department has produced another outstanding disciple."

"After the examination, make sure to have a proper talk with him. Don't let this opportunity go to waste."

Director Lin watched the scene coldly, while Director Gao nodded helplessly, acknowledging the instruction.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Celestial Elephant observed Zhang Yu's performance with surprise. "While Zhang Yu can't match Ping Han's brilliance, his efforts are still commendable!"

On the screen, Zhang Yu's palm techniques shifted, continuously using the Minor Threefold Combination to gather mud and sand from the battlefield, filling the earth giant's shattered body.

This transformed the earth giant into an undying behemoth, its form repeatedly breaking and reforming as it ferociously countered the Yellow Turban Warriors from all directions.

At the same time, surging Gang Qi coursed through the earth giant's body, flowing like newly forged muscles and meridians, circulating endlessly within its earthen frame.

With each circulation of Gang Qi, the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force within Zhang Yu's earth giant absorbed the explosive force and shockwaves from the incoming attacks.

This allowed the earth giant to execute a profound technique of using an opponent's strength against them. As it endured the relentless bombardment, it unleashed surging waves of Qi energy, sweeping toward the Yellow Turban Warriors before it.

Behind Zhang Yu, the Golden Thread Jade Wall floated, continuously emitting crimson Blazing Sun Rays that detonated distant Yellow Turban Warriors one by one.

Meanwhile, Azure Heaven Sand poured endlessly from the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch into the earth giant's body, enhancing the conductivity of Gang Qi and minimizing its consumption.

The Earthly Fiend Bottle and Earthshaking Seal activated simultaneously, unleashing either a torrential mudslide to engulf the Yellow Turban Warriors or a vast field of energy that froze approaching enemies in place, allowing the earth giant to stomp them into the ground.

At the same time, Great-Grandfather Yingxin manipulated his magical artifacts while reassuring Zhao Tianxing and Mo Tianyi.

Great-Grandfather Yingxin: Don't be nervous. Boss Zhang's strength is overwhelming. As long as we follow his plan, we'll be fine.

Zhao Tianxing: Senior, were you also a graduate of Myriad Laws University?

Great-Grandfather Yingxin: Haha, a hero doesn't dwell on past glories!

Great-Grandfather Yingxin: I'm just a Soul Cultivator now, just like you.

Great-Grandfather Yingxin: "I envy you. You've only been dead for a few years, right?"

Great-Grandfather Yingxin: "The first five years after death are crucial. The jobs you take and the resumes you polish during this time will determine your future income!"

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's mind raced as he precisely controlled every ounce of power he unleashed. He felt these forces gradually merging under his guidance, erupting with waves of increasingly formidable might!

"The Martial Dao Holy Body enhances both the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force and the Minor Threefold Combination!"

"It grants me Martial Dao Micro-Control, amplifying the power of my martial techniques and enhancing my ability to parry, redirect force, evade, destroy, control range, increase attack speed, raise attack frequency, and improve the penetrating power of my strikes!"

"When I combine the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force and the Minor Threefold Combination on this earth giant, their effects synergize!"

At that moment, Zhang Yu could sense his Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force Gang Qi coursing through the earth giant's entire body, granting it astonishing parrying and force-redirection capabilities!

Empowered by the Martial Dao Holy Body, the earth giant not only moved with the force of the Minor Threefold Combination but also continuously accumulated the redirected power from the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force!

This transformed the earth giant into a divine force, growing stronger with each clash!

With a deafening roar, the earth giant took a single step. The combined weight of a small mountain, the momentum of the Minor Threefold Combination, and the rebounding force borrowed from the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force shattered the ground into pieces. Yellow Turban Warriors and their horses were sent flying in all directions!

At that moment, Zhang Yu had yet to fully unleash the power of the Minor Threefold Combination. After all, he had only nominally been cultivating the Imperial Scholar Divine Transformation, the Third Absolute of Earth and Wood, for less than two months!

---

True Monarch Cloud Haven observed Zhang Yu's performance, his gaze flickering slightly. "Zhang Yu's control range over the Minor Threefold Combination is limited, but the destructive force he unleashes is astonishing!"

True Monarch Celestial Elephant beside him commented, "His mastery of the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force is also flawless. Whether borrowing momentum or unleashing explosive power, every strand of Gang Qi and every ounce of strength is perfectly synchronized with the Minor Threefold Combination!"

"Achieving such immense power with limited resources — every ounce of strength maximized for lethal effect — this is a true prodigy of the Martial Dao!"

Yet even such a prodigy only warranted a passing glance from True Monarch Celestial Elephant.

After all, this was not an era for Martial Dao prodigies. True Monarch Celestial Elephant was far more interested in prodigies of civil engineering, cryptocurrency trading, or those whose immense wealth qualified them as geniuses with Innate Dao Physiques.

True Monarch Cloud Haven nodded slightly, inwardly assessing Zhang Yu's potential as "promising."

True Monarch Cloud Haven was more concerned with something else entirely than Zhang Yu's remarkable talent in the Martial Dao.

While reviewing Zhang Yu's records using his authority as Vice Principal, True Monarch Cloud Haven discovered a hidden piece of information:

"Zhang Yu used the privilege granted by passing the Foundation Establishment exam to designate True Monarch Magnetic Pole as his mentor!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven couldn't help but glance at Director Gao, who was intently observing Zhang Yu's performance.

Does Old Gao even know that his nominal disciple has chosen someone else as his mentor? he wondered.

True Monarch Cloud Haven couldn't be certain. If Zhang Yu had any sense, he would have consulted True Monarch Magnetic Pole first and obtained her consent before officially designating her as his mentor, even with the privilege to do so.

How did Zhang Yu, a Civil Engineering student, manage to get involved with True Monarch Magnetic Pole?

Old Gao, on the other hand, has known her for centuries!

And Zhang Yu's a martial arts prodigy — perfect for artifact crafting!

In his mind, True Monarch Cloud Haven imagined Old Gao leading Zhang Yu to meet True Monarch Magnetic Pole, then ushering his disciple into her office.

True Monarch Cloud Haven sent a message: Old Gao, your disciple is developing well!

"Director Gao, it's all thanks to the school leaders for creating such a conducive environment!"

"Old Gao, you're becoming more magnanimous!" True Monarch Cloud Haven replied. "As for disciples, out with the old, in with the new. Don't take it too hard!"

Director Gao stared at True Monarch Cloud Haven's message, momentarily puzzled. He didn't immediately grasp the meaning.

But then it clicked. "He's talking about Ping Han, isn't he?"

"He wants me to talk to Ping Han, persuade him if I can, but not dwell on it if I can't?"

A hint of helplessness crept onto Director Gao's face. The more he watched Ping Han's domineering performance on the field, the more he felt a pang of regret.

Meanwhile, the battle dynamics shifted once more.

Yellow Turban Warriors with twin wings sprouting from their backs soared into the sky, launching aerial assaults.

Zhang Yu's heart skipped a beat. "Did they really spend this much on the exam?"

The other candidates also stiffened, bracing themselves for the new threat.

Just then, Su Yanyang noticed a flurry of notifications flashing in his Bionic Eye. He finally couldn't resist clicking to check.

"The Jade Nectar Coin has risen to 15?"

Su Yanyang's heart bloomed with delight as he witnessed the scene. He burst into laughter, "Perfect timing!"

He immediately allocated more Calculation Pool resources to his Soul Cultivators, further enhancing the power of the tomb and the Grand Formation.

Defensive structures rose from the ground, operated by the Soul Cultivators, to intercept the swarm of Yellow Turban Warriors descending from the sky.

---

Meanwhile, Xiao Yunji calmly announced, "Your turn!"

"Complete this task well, and you won't be disappointed!"

The six magical artifacts on her six arms each swapped out for a new batch of Soul Cultivators.

These Soul Cultivators came from her family's Ancestor's construction company. Not only were they experienced builders, but they also possessed unique talents and motivations.

Some were nearing the end of their lives and desperately needed life-extending resources. Others had worked in monotonous jobs for years, their minds dulled, and saw this as a rare opportunity. Still others had no descendants to support them and relied entirely on their own efforts.

"Each has a reason to fight desperately, each burns with fierce determination, and each races against death itself!"

Xiao Yunji had personally selected these individuals to maximize her combat power during today's Military Certificate Examination.

---

On the other side, as the number on Ping Han's chest increased, his imposing aura seemed to grow proportionally.

It wasn't just Ping Han's own imposing aura that intensified; even his magical artifacts, bionic, and the formation beneath his feet seemed to grow fiercer as the price of the Jade Nectar Coin soared.

This was because, under Ping Han's guidance, all his Soul Cultivators had invested in the coin.

With the coin's value skyrocketing, these cultivators advanced rapidly, not only enhancing their Calculation Pool resources but also becoming fiercely motivated, their fighting spirit reaching new heights.

Ping Han immediately upgraded the network services for his magical artifacts and bionic from standard to gold membership, unleashing even greater power.

As for Ping Han himself, he felt his Dao Heart becoming increasingly flawless and complete.

"For the past two years, I endured humiliation and exercised endless patience, all for this day when the Coin Dao would reach its zenith!"

"Today, it is finally my turn, Ping Han, to soar to the heavens!"

With a palm strike, a vast wave of mud and sand coalesced into a colossal hand. Empowered by his bionic and magical artifacts, its strength surged violently. The hand shot skyward, crushing the entire swarm of Yellow Turban Warriors in a single grasp!

Boom.

---

Zhang Yu's figure had already sunk into the earth giant's body!

With each step of the earth giant, massive amounts of Yellow Turban Warrior remains were swept into its body and delivered to Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu's figure then underwent a sudden, explosive growth, enlarging his physique before devouring the remains and beginning to digest them.

Although he currently possessed the Martial Dao Holy Body, retaining only 10% of the University Holy Body's effects, his formidable foundation, combined with the Martial Dao Holy Body and the Earth Devouring Divine Art, granted him extraordinary digestive capabilities.

Furthermore, the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill now converged within his digestive system, forming a protective layer like armor around his stomach and intestines, further enhancing his ability to break down and grind food. This was amplified by the cold-heat fluctuations of the Cold and Blazing Sun meridians, as well as the power of cultivation arts such as Spring and Autumn Endless Zen and the Battle Demon Life-Shattering Art.

At that moment, Zhang Yu's digestive system functioned like a colossal furnace, continuously refining the remains of the Yellow Turban Warriors into various high-strength materials.

True Monarch Cloud Haven's gaze swept across the examinees, his voice filled with admiration. "Excellent, excellent! Each displays their unique Divine Powers and peerless skills. Every one of them is capable of breaking through during battle. Truly worthy of being the prodigies of Myriad Laws!"
