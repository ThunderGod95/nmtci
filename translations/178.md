# Chapter 178: Successful Hunt of the Evil God

Meanwhile.

Below the apartment building.

At the distant intersection.

Song Xu and the others were speeding toward the building's direction.

_Hmph,_ Song Xu thought to himself. _Big trucks are only for running people over._

_When it comes to actually rushing somewhere, we have one top-tier courier and two top-tier deliverymen. Both their speed and carrying capacity are astonishing._

At this moment, Song Xu and the two other believers from the construction site were each being carried on the backs of the two deliverymen believers and the one courier believer. Their bodies traced a series of afterimages as they swiftly weaved through the flow of traffic.

Seeing the incessant urgent messages still coming from Huoshan, Song Xu replied: Hold on, we have arrived.

---

Inside the apartment.

Huoshan heard the other person's sigh, thick with unwillingness, and watched as his figure finally departed. He let out a small breath of relief.

Then, seeing Song Xu's message that he had arrived, he was mostly reassured.

_I'm finally safe._

A moment later, seeing Song Xu walk in from the door, Huoshan was overjoyed and immediately opened the interlayer to rush over. "You brat, you're finally here!"

But when he saw the face that turned toward him, Huoshan suddenly felt that something was wrong.

_Why is this guy's face a bit stiff…_

_This guy seems…_

_He's not Song Xu?_

Huoshan looked at the man's pants and suddenly realized, _Damn it, isn't this the same guy from before? He changed his facial features to disguise himself as Song Xu? This guy has Song Xu's information and even knew Song Xu was coming up?_

The person who had walked into the room at this moment was none other than Zhang Yu, who had circulated his Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi to alter his facial features according to Song Xu's file, thereby disguising himself as Song Xu.

But in truth, this disguise was very crude; if Huoshan had observed carefully, he would have quickly realized that Zhang Yu was not Song Xu.

However, in his state of panic, Huoshan failed to notice the discrepancies with Zhang Yu in the first instance.

Seeing Zhang Yu walking toward him with a smile, Huoshan let out a shriek and tried to retreat.

But with a flash of his figure, Zhang Yu had already seized Huoshan in his hand.

"Finally caught you," Fu Ji laughed. "Zhang Yu, quickly use the method I taught you to suppress him! Don't let him move around!"

Zhang Yu's palm shot out, fiercely slapping the teddy bear's body and causing Huoshan to vibrate violently.

According to Fu Ji, while evil gods like them possessed great supernatural power when performing rituals, their physical bodies were not strong; otherwise, they would be unable to evade the detection of righteous gods.

For instance, although this teddy bear appeared to be just a toy, physical attacks on it could still inflict damage upon the evil god.

Furthermore, because its consciousness was hidden within and possessed a complete sense of perception, strong vibrations could disrupt the evil god's awareness through its sensory faculties.

According to Fu Ji, it was just like motion sickness.

Seeing Huoshan immobilized after a bout of shaking, Zhang Yu grabbed the black pearl that was Fu Ji's transformed state and pressed it fiercely onto the teddy bear's head.

With a surge of evil god power, Fu Ji had temporarily suppressed the teddy bear's consciousness.

In an instant, Fu Ji swiftly searched the power of the rituals within its body and cheered, "Haha, it worked, Zhang Yu! I've temporarily suppressed this fellow."

One after another, ritual records flashed before Fu Ji's eyes. Fu Ji muttered, "Let me take a look first and see what rules he has set for his believers."

Just then, a series of sounds of something tearing through the air approached, as if six figures were streaking across the night sky, rapidly closing in on the room's location.

Bai Zhenzhen: Yu-boy! Why the hell aren't you down yet! They're already on their way up!

Zhang Yu had no time to read the message Bai Zhenzhen sent. Hearing the ever-nearing sound of tearing air, he understood that they were about to arrive at the door.

---

Song Xu's group of six arrived at high speed, rushing through the broken-down door, only to see the entire room filled with all sorts of smashed objects.

And the teddy bear was sitting upright on a chair, with a person kneeling before it, who from the side appeared to be Li Quan.

Seeing the teddy bear was unharmed, all six members of Song Xu's group let out a slight sigh of relief.

However, a question arose in Song Xu's mind, _Li Quan is back so soon? Did he pay the fine and bail money and hurry back over?_

And upon seeing everyone's arrival, Li Quan let out a cold snort and said, "What took you all so long? Do you have any idea how frightened the master was?"

"As believers of an evil god, is this how you protect the master's safety?"

"Kneel down at once!"

At the same time, the teddy bear on the sofa was seen to vibrate and emit a cold snort, seemingly in displeasure at their attitude.

Although the evil god's believers still harbored various questions in their hearts, upon seeing this, they all hurriedly knelt before the sofa and began to apologize to Huoshan.

"We're sorry, Master, we arrived late."

"Master, we already rushed here at full speed…"

"Master, we will definitely help you get revenge!"

Yet, the more Song Xu looked at Li Quan, the more something felt wrong. The more he looked, the more he felt that the person's appearance was actually different from Li Quan's.

It was just that Huoshan commanded them remotely most of the time, and Song Xu rarely saw Li Quan on a daily basis, which was why he had not recognized the imposter at first glance.

Thus, with a flash of his figure, Song Xu directly blocked the exit, then his gaze hardened as he said, "You are not Li Quan!"

Feeling the gazes of everyone at the scene turn to him in unison, Zhang Yu's face changed slightly. As his Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi circulated, he had already transformed into another unfamiliar appearance.

"That's right, I'm not Li Quan."

"Which means you have revealed your identities as believers of an evil god…"

Hearing these words, the expressions of the group changed drastically, and then they felt a wave of searing heat roll through their bodies, as if flames were about to erupt from within them.

"This is bad!" Song Xu exclaimed in alarm. "Get him! Kill him!"

Unlike Zhang Yu, who had been abandoned by Fu Ji at the beginning and later managed to suppress her, these six believers of Song Xu had always been under Huoshan's control, bound by a whole series of vows, such as not to harm Huoshan and not to reveal their identities as evil god believers.

Looking at the agitated state of the six, Zhang Yu's mind flashed back to the memory of watching Zhou Tianyi self-immolate to death in the abandoned building.

At that time, Zhou Tianyi, as a believer of an evil god, had self-immolated precisely because he had accidentally revealed his identity.

Later, Zhang Yu had asked Fu Ji about this matter and only then learned that many evil gods would proactively establish such vows to prevent being tracked by righteous gods.

Once a believer discovered that their identity had been exposed—whether it was exposed actively or passively—it would trigger the backlash of the ritual.

And just moments ago, after Fu Ji had checked Huoshan's ritual records, this point was further confirmed.

Looking at the increasingly red skin of the six people at the scene, Zhang Yu thought to himself, _What a truly moronic ritual._

At the same time, Song Xu felt the power of the ritual within his body begin its countdown. He let out a roar and charged toward Zhang Yu.

"Kill him before the backlash is complete! Then it won't count as leaking information, and we still have a chance to survive!"

The other five also showed expressions of drastic change, and one by one, they mustered all their strength, about to launch a fatal attack on Zhang Yu.

At this moment, Song Xu, plus five experts at the peak of Qi Refinement—six individuals—swept toward Zhang Yu with a ferocious killing intent born of desperation and a willingness to die. The immense pressure was something Zhang Yu had never encountered before.

The surging streams of power compressed the atmosphere, seeming to bring the very air in the room to a boil.

Palm force, fist force, leg force… six great experts, six killing techniques simultaneously blasted toward Zhang Yu, looking as if they would tear him to shreds in the very next instant.

But in the face of such terrifying pressure, Zhang Yu merely smiled faintly, lunged forward, and grabbed the teddy bear on the sofa to use as a shield before him.

_Do not harm the evil god!_

Seeing the teddy bear in front of Zhang Yu, the six believers were all shocked and had to alter their moves, no longer daring to strike forward.

This abrupt change of technique under full power made the six masters so frustrated they could have coughed up blood, their qi, blood, and magic power churning within them.

And Zhang Yu, seizing this momentary opportunity, charged forward instead. Astral qi surged from his entire body, and the black Formless Cloud-Astral Qi had already completely engulfed everyone.

"What is this stuff!"

Feeling his vision completely obscured, Song Xu reacted with extreme speed. He thought it was this astral qi blocking his sight, so he let out a furious roar and swung both palms, scattering the sky-filling, black cloud-like Formless Cloud-Astral Qi.

The other five also moved with swiftness, tearing the vast expanse of astral qi to shreds as if ripping through clouds and mist.

The Formless Cloud-Astral Qi that Yu Xinghan couldn't completely dispel even after half an hour, now under the joint assault of these six great experts, did not even last for half a second.

But just as they dispersed the astral qi in an instant, they heard a bang as the nearby window shattered.

Looking at the broken window, one of the deliveryman believers, being the fastest, moved like a flash of lightning and was the first to leap out, intending to chase after Zhang Yu.

The remaining five, feeling the ritual's power within them growing hotter and hotter, also leaped out of the window without hesitation.

A fall of a mere few floors was not enough to kill them.

At this moment, they were filled only with a sky-high killing intent and the resolve not to rest until Zhang Yu was dead.

But when they saw the stool that had smashed the window and was now plummeting downward, their eyes filled with a mixture of shock and rage.

_Was it that stool that just smashed the window and fell? Not the person who jumped out?_

Meanwhile, inside the apartment room, Zhang Yu remained hidden within a patch of black shadow, the very shadow formed by the Great Sun Qi Sea absorbing light.

Just now, he had first used the teddy bear to force the six to alter their attacks, buying time to use the Great Sun Qi Sea in conjunction with the Formless Cloud-Astral Qi to obscure their vision. Then, he had grabbed a stool and smashed the window, while he himself slipped into this patch of shadow.

At this moment, Zhang Yu stood within this darkness, as if he had become one with the shadows in the corner of the room, appearing utterly natural.

Zhang Yu listened to the roars of anger and screams of agony from outside the window and lamented, "The information gap, ah, the information gap."

With that, he picked up the teddy bear from the floor and turned to walk out of the apartment.

At the same time, six human torches roared as they soared into the sky, leaping toward the apartment's window, but they soon turned to ash both inside and outside the apartment, dissipating into the night sky.

Several minutes later, a large number of constables arrived at the scene and sealed off the entire apartment floor.

Not long after, under the reverent gazes of the many constables, the Songyang City Patrol Team arrived and began to investigate the incident.

And on the other side, after Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen retrieved the surveillance footage from the abandoned building in the suburbs, the two returned to their apartment, looked at Fu Ji with great anticipation, and said, "Hey, can you raise our potential now?"
