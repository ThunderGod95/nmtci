# Chapter 598: Dual Swords United, Enjoy the Blessing

After being selected for his university's Ten Greats League team, Zhang Yu naturally gained access to extensive information about the league and its competing universities.

Among this data, the military-grade combat capabilities of each institution were of particular interest to him.

The moment he saw Ying Yufan transform from his human form into a colossal dragon, Zhang Yu immediately recognized the cultivation art being used.

"The Celestial Monster Myriad Transformations Technique," he thought, "a daoist art that refines one's bloodline power, allowing for true shapeshifting into other living beings, starting from flesh, blood, and Magic Power."

"After transformation, not only does one's physical attributes change, but they also gain new daoist abilities..."

As these thoughts raced through his mind, Zhang Yu unleashed a punch imbued with surging Gang Qi, amplified by the immense power of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. His fist collided violently with the dragon's claw.

With a thunderous boom, Zhang Yu felt a massive force slam into his body, sending him flying backward.

Meanwhile, the dragon form of Ying Yufan merely recoiled slightly before lunging forward again in pursuit.

"As expected," Zhang Yu mused inwardly, "his transformed physical strength far surpasses the limits of an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator."

"This isn't human strength anymore; it's the power of a dragon."

Zhang Yu realized that the Celestial Monster Myriad Transformations Technique had truly altered his bloodline, race, and physical attributes. Since different species have inherently different body types, their corresponding physical attributes naturally vary as well.

The Immortal Dao system established by the Ten Great Sects, including its numerical standards for physical strength, was based on the human body as a blueprint. This explains why the system uses convenient whole numbers for calculations.

However, certain races among the monsterfolk sometimes surpass these numerical limits.

Zhang Yu mused inwardly, "To achieve such power, the opponent must also be using a military-grade Bionic."

He knew that the Celestial Monsters University's Monster Studies Department possessed a military-grade Bionic specifically designed to complement the Celestial Monster Myriad Transformations Technique. This Bionic greatly amplifies the diverse transformations granted by the cultivation art while further reducing the strain on the user.

As they spoke, the dragon had already pursued Zhang Yu like a black lightning bolt, batting him back and forth like a rubber ball. In the blink of an eye, they had covered several miles.

Ying Yufan coldly sneered, "Scum, can you only run?"

Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "Monster, the test is complete. You..."

Zhang Yu opened his mouth and spat forth a torrent of flames.

"You're worthy to be my prisoner."

Seeing the flames rushing toward him, Ying Yufan roared, unleashing a bolt of lightning that instantly shattered the flames.

But the next moment, as he watched the shattered flames scatter in all directions, Ying Yufan realized they hadn't been destroyed at all — they had merely split apart, encircling him while evading his attack.

"Heavenly Sun Radiance God?"

At the same moment, Ying Yufan felt his dragon body tense as clusters of gravitational force temporarily restrained him.

Undaunted, he snorted coldly and spat forth a torrent of water, clashing violently with the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's flames.

In an instant, a shockwave of superheated steam swept across several miles, instantly obliterating countless plants and trees.

Ying Yufan roared, and a long banner materialized from the Spirit Realm — the Monster Summoning Banner, a military-grade magical artifact.

Tens of thousands of phantom Demon Beasts emerged from the banner, lunging at Zhang Yu with tearing claws and fangs.

"An offensive artifact spirit refined from the living souls of Demon Beasts..." Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened as he summoned twenty-four sword shadows, forming the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation, which slashed out with devastating force.

Ying Yufan immediately sensed that not only was his Monster Summoning Banner blocked by the opponent's Sword Realm, but the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power and Heavenly Sun Radiance God, under the sword formation's orchestration, had become even more unpredictable, striking from every conceivable angle and gradually inflicting wounds across his dragon form.

In the blink of an eye, Ying Yufan realized that this youth before him possessed not only a myriad of combat techniques but also lightning-fast reflexes, always reacting correctly at crucial moments. Every military-grade power at his disposal was being wielded with astonishing effectiveness.

"And..."

Sensing an unknown shift deep beneath the earth, Ying Yufan knew his opponent was still preparing some kind of lethal move.

"Boy, it seems I underestimated you."

In an instant, the colossal dragon surged skyward, its flesh and blood violently transforming as it morphed into a roc.

"I originally intended to take a captive back..."

Zhang Yu smiled. "Monster, are you trying to escape?"

The roc narrowed its eyes slightly, letting out a cold snort. "Boy, do you know how many people are watching our battle right now?"

"Openly discriminating against monsterfolk on the live broadcast won't just anger me."

"Let's settle this next time we meet."

In the next instant, amid a thunderous roar and blinding flashes of lightning, the roc vanished into the distant horizon.

"That thing sure can run," Zhang Yu muttered, frowning slightly. "Those who cultivate the Celestial Monster Myriad Transformations Technique are indeed tricky to catch."

Simultaneously, he slowly withdrew the power of his Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon, which had been extended underground, and the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

As these two forces receded, the vast quantities of mineral veins that had been temporarily transformed into a magical artifact gradually reverted to their normal state.

"Did he sense my preparations?" Zhang Yu wondered. "These high-level monsterfolk are even more perceptive than I anticipated."

Shaking his head, Zhang Yu, having withdrawn his power, accelerated again, heading swiftly toward his destination.

For the next several dozen kilometers, he encountered no further resistance, though he did observe signs of intense combat in the distance.

Zhang Yu refrained from intervening, knowing this was not the moment for full-scale engagement.

While reviewing the competition rules, Zhang Yu had realized one crucial fact.

"In this team competition, the number of advancing members is determined by the team's ranking. Only the first-place team can advance all members to the second stage."

"The criteria for selecting advancing members will undoubtedly be based on individual performance."

Zhang Yu took a deep breath, thinking to himself, "I must demonstrate sufficient strength in this team competition. Even if Myriad Laws doesn't secure first place, this will greatly increase our chances of advancing."

"Fortunately, the team competition lasts three full days."

"Over these three days, if I can leverage the abundant resources of the floating continent to establish a base, deploy formations, and construct defenses, my combat prowess will skyrocket."

"That will be my moment to truly shine in this battle..."

Thus, Zhang Yu focused intently on advancing, and before he knew it, the terrain had gradually transitioned from dense forest to sprawling grasslands.

Suddenly, a distant sword cry pierced the air.

Just as Zhang Yu was about to bypass the ongoing conflict by taking a wide detour, his expression abruptly changed, and he charged directly toward the clash.

A familiar crimson sword qi soared skyward, radiating a world-shattering Sword Intent that seemed poised to tear heaven and earth asunder.

When Zhang Yu saw the familiar figure at the source of the sword qi, his heart leaped with joy: "It's A-Zhen, just as I thought!"

Bai Zhenzhen was currently besieged by two opponents, her sword qi raging wildly as she brutally shredded everything around her to pieces.

Xue Jiuyou, ranked sixth overall at Netherworld University and a student in the Biology Department, watched the scene lazily. "Does her sword qi not consume any Magic Power? That's just cheating."

Bai Luxiang, ranked fifth overall at White Bone University and a student in the Medical Department, said coldly, "This woman holds immense research value. Capture her, and she's yours as a prisoner, but I'll need samples of some of her organs."

Xue Jiuyou laughed heartily and threw a punch, letting the sword qi shred his right arm. Instantly, a fresh arm sprang from a nearby blood pool, replacing the shattered limb and channeling surging vital energy into an even stronger burst of power.

This Netherworld University student seemed utterly indifferent to his physical body, recklessly activating self-destruction mode. While unleashing terrifying power, he fought with suicidal abandon, constantly breaking through the sword qi and leaving a trail of wounds across Bai Zhenzhen's body.

Meanwhile, Bai Luxiang, though not attacking directly, casually gathered severed limbs and body parts from the ground. In an instant, he repaired them and submerged them in the blood pool, ready for Xue Jiuyou to use again.

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened as he observed the scene. "Xue Jiuyou is using the Netherspring Disintegration Great Art," he thought. "In ancient times, this cultivation art was a one-time self-detonation technique, renowned for its invincibility among those of the same cultivation realm. While it's no longer invincible in the modern era, students at Netherworld University have combined it with other military-grade Immortal Dao Technologies, allowing it to be used at will."

Zhang Yu's gaze shifted to Bai Luxiang. "This doctor is also troublesome. With him nearby providing healing, Xue Jiuyou's stamina and power are greatly enhanced."

With this thought, Zhang Yu erupted in a soaring blaze, hurtling directly toward Bai Luxiang's position.

"Hmm?" Sensing the surging heatwave, Bai Luxiang whirled around to face the incoming Zhang Yu.

"Another one?" Xue Jiuyou sneered. "It's that Civil Engineering brat from Myriad Laws! Deal with him first!"

Even as Zhang Yu clashed with his two opponents using the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, twenty-four flying swords had already encircled a thousand-meter radius, deploying the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation.

"A-Zhen... you understand what I mean, right?"

"Yu Zi, I understand."

Bai Zhenzhen smiled faintly, and in the next instant, a stream of sword qi slashed toward the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword before her.

*Boom!*

Seeing the sudden surge of sword qi, Bai Luxiang's gaze sharpened, and he moved to dodge aside.

But immediately, a surge of Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power swept toward him.

At the same time, two streams of sword qi, channeled through the sword formation, struck from both his front and back.

Then, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen flanked him, launching a coordinated assault on Bai Luxiang.

Meanwhile, Xue Jiuyou was temporarily held back by the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

As Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen closed in, Bai Zhenzhen's sword qi erupted with even greater ferocity, slashing relentlessly at the Bai Luxiang like a raging river.

"What?"

Bai Luxiang tried to evade, but Zhang Yu clung to him relentlessly, dragging him toward the storm of sword qi.

As Zhang Yu drew closer, Bai Zhenzhen's sword qi intensified further, surging forward like an unstoppable tidal wave.

"These two...", Bai Luxiang's heart jolted. "Zhang Yu is channeling sword qi to Bai Zhenzhen, and she's using him to amplify her Sword Intent..."

Xue Jiuyou: "It's more than that. This guy..."

Watching Zhang Yu fiercely battling the Bai Luxiang amidst the raging sword qi, Xue Jiuyou mused inwardly, "How can he trust Bai Zhenzhen, that madwoman, not to casually kill him? And how can she, that lunatic, trust Zhang Yu enough to let him channel her sword qi, yet maintain such a merciless assault?"

"Does this mean she trusts Zhang Yu won't die by her sword?"

In the next instant, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen vanished without a trace. Not only their figures, but the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, the flying sword, and the sword qi all disappeared completely.

Only the flames, searing heat, and destructive force of the sword qi continued to batter Xue Jiuyou and Bai Luxiang.

Xue Jiuyou and Bai Luxiang were both shaken to the core. "Is this even possible?!"

"Bai Zhenzhen's Divine Spiritual Root can protect her teammates too?"

Xue Jiuyou's resolve faltered. "Their coordination is flawless — their minds seem perfectly synchronized, and their abilities complement each other perfectly..."

Bai Luxiang thought grimly, "I can't continue fighting them."

In that instant, both men finally decided to retreat, bolting away in opposite directions.

Xue Jiuyou split his body into dozens of bloody shadows, scattering and vanishing from sight.

Unable to pursue Xue Jiuyou, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen focused their assault on Bai Luxiang.

Under their relentless assault, Bai Luxiang was soon drenched in blood, collapsing to the ground with his hands raised in surrender. "I surrender! I surrender! Take me prisoner!"

With a smile, he added, "Take it easy on me, you two. Come to the hospital later and I'll give you a discount."

Zhang Yu let out a sigh of relief and turned to Bai Zhenzhen beside him. "You take him."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded, preparing to completely neutralize Bai Luxiang's resistance, but suddenly froze. Bai Luxiang had vanished before her eyes.

At the same moment, Zhang Yu realized that his bionic eye could still see Bai Luxiang, while his natural eye could no longer detect him.

He immediately realized what had happened. "Someone's attacking my Bionic Eye!"

"But I can still see him with my natural eye!"

Zhang Yu abruptly activated his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, lunging to seize the fleeing Bai Luxiang. But as he reached out, Bai Luxiang's form was swept away by Earthly Fiend Gravity and dissipated into thin air.

"Another illusion?"

"Not just my Bionic Eye — is even what my natural eye sees a hallucination?"

As Zhang Yu stood there, stunned, a hand gently pressed down on his shoulder, pushing him to the ground.

"Heh heh, I've been studying the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao since I got back."

"These outdated concepts like defilement, humiliation, and forced swordsmanship... they're actually quite intriguing."

A sickly sweet scent wafted past Zhang Yu's ear.

"Seeing you all here suddenly made me think: what if I were to brutally defile you right now, in front of Bai Zhenzhen?"

Amidst a crackling explosion, Zhang Yu felt a sudden chill as his clothes vanished completely.

"I want her to watch me forcibly wield you, right before her eyes!"

"Let her watch helplessly, feeling her own powerlessness, her utter worthlessness..."

"How would her Extreme Emotion Sword Dao react then?"

"How would it react, Bai Zhenzhen?"

"Hahahahaha!"

As Kuang Tianqing's maniacal laughter echoed, her tongue lightly licked Zhang Yu's earlobe, followed by a soft chuckle. "Enjoy this. It's my gift to you. The next three minutes will be the most unforgettable bliss of your life, Immortal Scum."
