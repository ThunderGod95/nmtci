# Chapter 729: Cultivating Clones, Confronting the Evil Gods

Watching Zhang Yu release Gang Qi to envelop his body, True Monarch Celestial Elephant couldn't help but ask, "True Monarch Blazing Light, what are you doing?"

Zhang Yu's calm voice emerged from within the Gang Qi. "After these successive battles, I've gained some faint insights. This is the perfect opportunity to seize the moment and cultivate."

True Monarch Celestial Elephant watched, a sense of admiration stirring within him. "No wonder Zhang Yu progresses so quickly. Even after being captured, he still seizes every single second to cultivate. With such determination and mindset, even if he were reduced to poverty, he'd probably outlive everyone else by years."

Mu Qiansi, observing from the side, felt a similar surge of respect. "As expected of the strongest undergraduate. This mentality... I can't compare."

Meanwhile, within the layers of Gang Qi, Zhang Yu had already begun cultivating the Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art.

Of course, the Gang Qi barrier was merely a cover for his true actions.

"The Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art is a Daoist art for refining clones. It features three types of clones: the Illusionary Body, the Manifested Body, and the True Body."

The details of the Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art flowed through Zhang Yu's mind. "The Illusionary Body is a phantom clone. It can interfere with various detection methods and create lifelike duplicates, but it lacks a physical form and has almost no combat power."

"The Manifested Body is a clone with a physical form. It's created by projecting a portion of my power, granting it some actual combat capability."

"And the True Body..." Zhang Yu thought inwardly, "...is a True Clone, formed by truly dividing my own body."

"Each True Clone is a genuine part of my body, controlled by my consciousness. They can even cultivate alongside me."

Zhang Yu couldn't help but marvel. "True Monarch Heaven Devourer must have mastered the martial arts of so many different schools by using True Clones to cultivate simultaneously."

"Each additional True Clone doubles my cultivation efficiency."

"A Level 40 Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art allows for 16 True Clones. Including my original body, that's 17 times the cultivation efficiency."

At this thought, Zhang Yu grew even more eager to cultivate the "Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art".

However, cultivating the Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art presented a major hurdle: the need to refine various different Monsterfolk Bloodlines.

"Fortunately, I've already built up experience in this area from cultivating the "Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture"."

Now, as Zhang Yu reflected on the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture, he saw its deep connection to the Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art. Combining the two would unlock countless wondrous effects, allowing him to create ever-changing, infinitely profound clones.

"It's not just the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture that can be integrated..."

"If I add my Desolate Bull's Soul-Quelling Heart Manual, I can suppress the pain from a clone's death or injury."

"And with the Remnant Ox's Self-Sacrifice Heart Sutra, each True Clone can revitalize its flesh and accelerate regeneration."

"Plus, by incorporating the Immeasurable Heart Inner Dharma Body, I can split my consciousness into 16 streams to control the clones, unleashing even greater versatility and combat power..."

Zhang Yu calculated in his mind that if he could advance the "Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art" to Level 40, its power and effects would surely far surpass those of True Monarch Heaven Devourer.

Within the swirling mist, layers of Gang Qi rippled and pulsed as Zhang Yu cultivated. From time to time, roars like those of Demon Beasts echoed, as if a wild, monstrous power was being unleashed from within his body.

After a long while, the Gang Qi around Zhang Yu gradually settled. He had successfully completed the first cycle of the "Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art", achieving initial mastery.

"Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art" Level 1 (0/10)

Visions of light and shadow flashed through Zhang Yu's mind. He felt as if he had comprehended the "Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art" over and over again, finally achieving true enlightenment.

The next moment, a figure slowly emerged from Zhang Yu's body and sat cross-legged beside him.

The figure was completely naked, possessing a physical body identical to Zhang Yu's but without any Bionic equipment. This was the first True Clone he had created.

In that instant, he felt the True Clone was like an external organ that had grown outside his body — still under his complete control, yet providing an entirely separate physical form and set of senses.

"Nearly half my Magic Power has been diverted."

"My physical strength has also declined."

"It did inherit some of my Physical Divine Abilities, though."

"It has a Spiritual Root, Golden Core, and Nascent Soul, but they're all significantly weaker."

"From the looks of it, while the True Clone can use all the martial and daoist arts I've mastered, its combat power is definitely inferior to my main body."

"Hmm, and then there are Bionics, magical artifacts, and the like. If I want to boost the True Clone's combat and production capabilities, I'll need to prepare these items for it in advance."

As Zhang Yu silently assessed the situation, he retracted the True Clone back into his body, then released it again.

"At Level 1 of the "Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art", the clone's control range and the speed of its release and retraction are very limited. I need to keep leveling it up..."

The next moment, Zhang Yu released the True Clone once more, and it immediately began cultivating the "Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art" alongside him.

Soon after, both of Zhang Yu's bodies completed a full cultivation cycle. Boosted further by the Nascent Soul Sacred Body, they achieved a combined 6x cultivation efficiency.

"Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art" Level 1 (6/10)

Seeing this, Zhang Yu rejoiced inwardly. "Excellent! This speeds up my cultivation efficiency significantly."

With this thought, he wasted no time. Following the requirements of this daoist art, he applied the Monsterfolk Bloodline he had previously refined, aiming to cultivate a second True Clone as quickly as possible and further accelerate his progress.

At the same time, he mused, "It's a shame I was so focused on breaking through to new realms or mastering Immortal Sect techniques before. I never really pushed my progress with the "Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture", so I didn't collect more Monsterfolk Bloodlines."

"At this rate, I'll probably only be able to advance the "Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art" to around Level 20 today."

Soon after, another True Clone emerged from Zhang Yu's body and joined the cultivation session.

Nearby, True Monarch Celestial Elephant watched Zhang Yu, observing the swirling clouds of Gang Qi. He couldn't shake the feeling that the aura within had changed since he last looked.

"It feels like something's been added..." True Monarch Celestial Elephant wondered silently. "Speaking of which, what cultivation art is Zhang Yu practicing? Why does he need to conceal himself like this, preventing others from seeing?"

Suddenly, a chill ran down True Monarch Celestial Elephant's spine. He felt as if something was watching him.

Within the swirling clouds of mist, Zhang Yu gazed in True Monarch Celestial Elephant's direction and thought, "Perhaps I can refine some Monsterfolk Bloodline from True Monarch Celestial Elephant."

---

Outside the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map, when True Monarch Junior College saw Zhang Yu circulate his Gang Qi and begin cultivating diligently, he stopped paying him any mind.

"Hmph, false composure."

True Monarch Junior College refused to believe that after being captured, Zhang Yu could truly be as calm and serene as he appeared.

"He's so wealthy and influential, with such a promising future."

"Now that he's being forced to join the Righteous Qi Alliance, how could he not be panicking? How could he not be terrified?"

"He's just bluffing, trying to stall for time in a desperate struggle."

With this thought, True Monarch Junior College decided to ignore Zhang Yu completely.

He knew that in such situations, ignoring the captive was the most effective strategy.

"Trapped within the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map, the more I ignore him, the more he'll feel time slipping away in confinement. This will erode his psychological defenses, making it easier to recruit him as an Evil God Worshipper later."

Thus, True Monarch Junior College ceased all communication with Zhang Yu and led his subordinates to accelerate toward the Herald God's location.

To ensure the mission's success, he refrained from live-streaming any part of their subsequent journey, a decision that secretly astonished his subordinates.

True Monarch Junior College thought to himself, "According to True Monarch Immortal Slayer's instructions, I'm supposed to wait until we reach the Herald God, secure Zhang Yu's surrender, and are about to convert him into a believer before starting the stream."

"Sigh, if I stream the entire journey, it could easily expose our location."

"What if it attracts experts from the Ten Universities to attempt a rescue, or worse, leads them straight to the Herald God? That would create unnecessary complications."

Despite this reasoning, True Monarch Junior College couldn't help but feel a pang of resentment.

After all, he had long coveted the popularity and traffic Zhang Yu commanded. Now that he had finally suppressed his target and was about to recruit him and convert him into an Evil God Worshipper, what better material could there be? Not being able to stream it felt like he was losing a fortune for no reason.

"Maybe... just a short stream? A quick one mid-journey? I'm high in the sky; they won't be able to pinpoint my exact location from the video, right?"

Just as True Monarch Junior College was about to give in to temptation, True Monarch Immortal Slayer's words suddenly echoed in his mind.

"You people... you're always like this. Trying to be clever, showing off, stealing credit. That kind of personality will cause trouble sooner or later. Remember this: from now on, when I give you an order, do not act on your own initiative."

Recalling True Monarch Immortal Slayer's murderous warning, True Monarch Junior College sighed inwardly and ultimately decided against starting the livestream.

Of course, while the stream was off, the recording continued. His subordinates still circled him, filming every moment.

True Monarch Junior College planned to upload the full video of the process to the Dark Spirit Realm after everything was over. It should still attract a considerable amount of traffic.

In the blink of an eye, the land below blurred past as True Monarch Junior College drew ever closer to his destination.

Just then, he noticed a battle erupting ahead. Two Nascent Soul True Monarchs were locked in a fierce fight, and the one from the Righteous Qi Alliance was clearly on the verge of defeat.

"Should I intervene?" True Monarch Junior College's gaze flickered as he once again recalled True Monarch Immortal Slayer's warning.

But as he looked at the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map in his hand, he couldn't resist the urge to show off.

When True Monarch Immortal Slayer had given him the map, he had also sent over a basic instruction manual detailing how to use it to capture opponents.

Now, with the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map in his hand, the capture technique fresh in his mind, the cameras rolling beside him, and an ally about to be defeated right before his eyes...

"Who could possibly resist this?" True Monarch Junior College thought.

"Besides, I'm just reinforcing the battlefield and helping an ally suppress an enemy. What's wrong with showing off a little while I'm at it?"

"The Fifth Layer's battlefield is crawling with Nascent Soul cultivators from both sides locked in massive, earth-shattering battles. How could I possibly avoid them all?"

"And I haven't even started the livestream."

With that thought, True Monarch Junior College unfurled the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map. In an instant, the world itself seemed to warp and change color...

---

Inside the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map.

Zhang Yu, who was cultivating, suddenly looked up, sensing an abrupt shift in the spatial structure of the area.

The next moment, a figure descended from the sky, landing before Zhang Yu and the other two.

Staring at the newcomer, True Monarch Celestial Elephant exclaimed, "True Monarch Heavenly Intellect from Vajra University? How did you end up here too?"

True Monarch Heavenly Intellect, his body encased in golden bionic armor and towering like a giant, forced a bitter smile. "I ran into that True Monarch Junior College from the Righteous Qi Alliance. I don't know what kind of magic he used, but he just sent me right in here."

True Monarch Celestial Elephant began to explain their situation, but before he could finish, another figure dropped in — a Nascent Soul True Monarch from Celestial Monsters University.

True Monarch Celestial Elephant sighed. "True Monarch Desolate Tiger?"

"True Monarch Vengeful Ox, don't panic. I'll explain everything slowly."

"Mystic Fox, you're here too?"

After that, figures continued to fall into the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map one after another. In the end, besides Zhang Yu and True Monarch Celestial Elephant, six more Nascent Soul True Monarchs had arrived, three of whom were from Celestial Monsters University.

True Monarch Celestial Elephant gave another bitter smile. He hadn't expected that before they could even be rescued, True Monarch Junior College would capture so many more people.

True Monarch Celestial Elephant wasn't surprised that three of the six newcomers were monsterfolk. After all, the battlefield he'd been fighting on was under the jurisdiction of Celestial Monsters University, so encountering a few Monsterfolk True Monarchs was perfectly normal.

Nearby, True Monarch Desolate Tiger had been pacing restlessly ever since he was trapped, letting out occasional roars.

This True Monarch Desolate Tiger was a Nascent Soul True Monarch from the Dao Techniques Department of Celestial Monsters University. In the past, True Monarch Celestial Elephant had always felt a step below him whenever they met.

Since Zhang Yu was solely focused on his cultivation, True Monarch Desolate Tiger had naturally become the de facto leader of the monsterfolk after they were trapped in the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map.

"Now that there are so many of us," True Monarch Desolate Tiger declared, "let's combine our power and try to shatter this Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map again!"

Although they had each tried countless times before, always ending in failure, the Nascent Soul True Monarchs decided to give it another shot.

After failing once more, True Monarch Desolate Tiger couldn't help but turn to Zhang Yu. "True Monarch Blazing Light, aren't you going to join us?"

Zhang Yu's calm voice replied, "There's no need. The few of us don't have enough power to break this Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map by brute force alone."

True Monarch Desolate Tiger urged, "How will we know if we don't try? Or perhaps, True Monarch Blazing Light, you're an expert in Spatial Technology? Help us find a way out. We'll do whatever you say."

Zhang Yu replied calmly, "The time is not yet right. We should wait."

"Wait?" True Monarch Desolate Tiger's tiger-like eyes widened in disbelief. "That True Monarch Junior College plans to deliver us to the Evil Gods to be converted into Evil God Worshippers! I still have so much wealth tied up with the Ten Universities! What will happen to it if I'm turned into a Worshipper?"

As he glared at Zhang Yu, True Monarch Desolate Tiger couldn't help but recall various rumors.

"They say Zhang Yu discriminated against monsterfolk even during his Foundation Establishment days, even leading attacks on them at construction sites..."

The thought made True Monarch Desolate Tiger suspect Zhang Yu's uncooperative attitude stemmed from his prejudice against monsterfolk.

At True Monarch Desolate Tiger's words, the other cultivators' faces darkened, especially when they considered their unspent fortunes. Would their fellow cultivators from the same universities end up inheriting it all?

Zhang Yu remained silent, simply resuming his cultivation. Soon, another True Clone emerged from his body.

With the Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art reaching Level 20, Zhang Yu now possessed four True Clones, boosting his cultivation efficiency to five times its original rate.

It was at this moment that Zhang Yu felt his Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art gradually hitting a bottleneck.

He thought to himself, "Is it because I haven't refined enough monsterfolk?"

With this thought, Zhang Yu instinctively glanced at the other Monsterfolk Nascent Souls within the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map.

After a moment's consideration, Zhang Yu recalled all his True Clones into his body. Then, he turned to True Monarch Celestial Elephant and said, "True Monarch Celestial Elephant, please come here. I need your help with something."

With a swirl of Gang Qi, Zhang Yu enveloped True Monarch Celestial Elephant in layers of mist.

Nearby, True Monarch Desolate Tiger watched Zhang Yu with suspicion, wondering what he was up to.

The next moment, True Monarch Desolate Tiger's nose twitched as the sudden scent of blood filled the air. His gaze hardened as he recalled the rumors of Zhang Yu's prejudice against monsterfolk. With a loud bang, he charged into the cloud of mist where Zhang Yu was.

"Celestial Elephant!"

With a thunderous boom, True Monarch Desolate Tiger was violently thrown back out of the mist just as he entered.

At the same time, True Monarch Celestial Elephant's voice emerged from within: "I'm fine! I'm just helping True Monarch Blazing Light with something."

True Monarch Desolate Tiger stared at the swirling Gang Qi, his expression a mixture of shock and uncertainty. In the instant he was repelled, he felt as if there were far more than two people inside the mist — it was like a group had ambushed him, sending him flying.

"What in the world is Zhang Yu doing?"

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu refined the Monsterfolk Bloodline from True Monarch Celestial Elephant's body, a jolt of excitement ran through him. "Excellent! The bloodline of a Monsterfolk Nascent Soul is indeed far more potent than any I've refined before. A single portion contains more power than many previous batches combined."

He calculated silently, "With the Monsterfolk Nascent Souls currently in the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map, I might be able to advance the Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art to Level 40."

While Zhang Yu was making rapid progress in his cultivation within the map, True Monarch Junior College had also reached his destination. His voice now traveled across vast distances through the Dark Spirit Realm, reporting to the Herald God.

After listening to True Monarch Junior College's report, the Herald God replied, "I'm currently overseeing the upgrade of the Evil God Register and don't have time to deal with Zhang Yu myself. However, I'll send another Evil God to preside over the ritual. Just hand Zhang Yu over to them when they arrive."

With that, the Herald God sent a message to the Evil God group chat, asking who was interested in taking on a mission.

Almost instantly, the Auspicious God's avatar popped up.

"I'll do it!" the Auspicious God declared enthusiastically. "No one in the entire Righteous Qi Alliance knows Zhang Yu better than I do! I have the most extensive experience dealing with him. Who else is more qualified for this task?"

---

Just as the Auspicious God was volunteering himself to the Herald God, the Joy God had already rushed to True Monarch Junior College's location at top speed.

"Hmph, that Auspicious God," the Joy God scoffed. "He drones on about past events at every meeting. If we let you capture Zhang Yu, you'll be completely insufferable!"

The Joy God gazed at the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map in True Monarch Junior College's hands, thinking, "Since this was my mistake, I'll be the one to clean it up."

"True Monarch Junior College..." the Joy God began, his eyes fixed on Zhang Yu within the map. "Hand Zhang Yu over to me for now. I've already spoken with the Herald God, and he has agreed. I'll be responsible for Zhang Yu until the Auspicious God arrives."

After confirming this, True Monarch Junior College handed the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map to the believer standing behind the Joy God. He then added, "True Monarch Immortal Slayer wants me to confirm Zhang Yu's conversion into a believer, especially the final ritual. He's requested that I livestream it."

The Joy God nodded. "No problem."

The next moment, the Joy God looked at the numerous Nascent Soul Cultivators within the map and exclaimed in surprise, "Besides Zhang Yu, there are so many others?"

True Monarch Junior College smiled faintly. "Just some stragglers I picked up along the way."

"To master this Immortal Sect Magical Artifact so quickly... True Monarch Junior College, your methods are truly impressive," the Joy God remarked.

True Monarch Junior College simply smiled without replying, already thinking about the videos of himself using the Immortal Sect Magical Artifact to subdue the Nascent Soul True Monarchs. He would definitely upload them to the Dark Spirit Realm later.

---

Within the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map.

The Joy God's voice suddenly descended from the sky.

"Zhang Yu, I am the Joy God. I am responsible for converting you into a believer..."

Hearing the Joy God's voice, Zhang Yu replied while continuing his cultivation, "Bring your leader. I don't speak to small fry."

For Zhang Yu, the primary target in his hunt for Evil Gods was naturally the Herald God. According to the intelligence he had gathered from the Righteous Qi Alliance, the Herald God was the leader of all the Evil Gods in the alliance and the keeper of the Evil God Register.

Hearing Zhang Yu's words, the Joy God's voice faltered slightly before he coldly retorted, "The leader you're looking for is me. I am the highest authority here."

Without giving Zhang Yu a chance to interrupt, the Joy God quickly continued, "Zhang Yu, I hope you understand that I am offering you a chance — a chance to achieve true financial freedom and cultivation freedom. An opportunity you could never obtain under the Heavenly Court's rule..."

Just then, True Monarch Desolate Tiger snorted coldly. "Hmph, joining you means destroying all our foundations in the Ten Universities. Do you really think we would agree?"

The Joy God sneered. "Foundations? What use are they? As long as you live under the rule of the Heavenly Court and the Immortals, no matter how powerful, talented, or wealthy you become, there will always come a day when you are eliminated."

"Because the Immortals will forever drive the world forward, forcing everyone to climb upward, risking life and limb. You must constantly strive, constantly seize, with no rest. The moment you slow down, you are discarded."

"Even if you never stop, always advancing, the changing times and technological progress will still render you obsolete."

"Throughout all of Kunxu, who besides the Immortals is not subject to this fate?"

Hearing these words, the Nascent Soul True Monarchs felt a deep resonance, and for a moment, no one could refute him.

Although no one argued, the True Monarchs remained unwilling to join the Evil Gods.

Just then, the Joy God sighed deeply. "Did you know that even our leaders, the Evil God Kings, are Ancient Gods who were cast aside by the Immortals?"

True Monarch Celestial Elephant was stunned. "Ancient Gods?"

The Joy God said, "Yes, the Ancient Gods — born of heaven and earth, divine from their very creation — were just such beings. But the Immortals deemed them insufficiently useful, insufficiently obedient, and insufficiently efficient, and ultimately replaced them all with the New Gods of today."

"Even the old faiths were systematically purged."

"If even gods like these can be replaced, what use are your foundations? Your elimination is merely a matter of time."

Hearing the Joy God's words, Zhang Yu's heart stirred. He recalled collecting antiques for Lady Fortune. When he had reviewed the information on those artifacts, he had sensed they were used in ancient rituals to worship deities. Now it seemed the Evil Gods and Ancient Gods were indeed connected in many ways.

The Joy God continued, "Only by joining the Evil Gods can you achieve financial freedom, where your passive income covers all cultivation expenses. Only then can you achieve cultivation freedom, where your passive cultivation keeps pace with the average speed of your peers."

"This is the only way to achieve lasting peace, to secure your Dao once and for all. You will no longer be bound by arduous labor — no overtime, no work, no toil... That is what it means to be an Immortal."

True Monarch Desolate Tiger snorted coldly. "No work, no overtime, no toil... and you can earn money? You can get stronger? Who are you trying to fool?"

In True Monarch Desolate Tiger's view, even Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, even those in the Finance Department, even sect members — all had to constantly learn, work, and advance. The only difference was the nature of their work, the content of their studies, and where they focused their efforts.

Get stronger without effort? True Monarch Desolate Tiger simply didn't believe it.

The Joy God smiled faintly. "Of course, there's a way. By harnessing faith, by leveraging the attention and thoughts of the masses, you can make them work for you, make them cultivate for you..."

True Monarch Desolate Tiger snorted again. "You've said so much, but your so-called Evil God Kings have already been eliminated and are hiding in the lower levels of Kunxu. Why should I believe you?"

The Joy God smiled serenely. "Though the Evil God Kings have stepped down from their divine positions, they have found a more important role. With the support of the Reincarnation Immortal Emperor, they now oversee the operation of the Reincarnation System."

"There, the Evil God Kings not only control the past and future of Kunxu's countless billions of beings but also suppress numerous entities defeated by the Immortals — beings of immense value who are barred from reincarnation..."

True Monarch Desolate Tiger said, "Impossible! How could a mighty Immortal Emperor possibly support you?"

The Joy God laughed heartily. "What's impossible about it? Use your heads and think carefully. Who do you think are the high-level existences who most want to see the wealthy fall, the great powers of the sects die, and the Immortals perish one by one?"

"It's the faction that controls reincarnation, the faction that governs life and death. And among the Ten Immortal Emperors, the Reincarnation Immortal Emperor is the supreme leader of this faction."

"The entire Reincarnation System has been waiting for this for a very, very long time."

"Only by completely drawing Kunxu's wealthiest and the highest Immortals into the cycle of reincarnation can the Reincarnation System truly be complete. The profits contained within would even surpass the entire current Reincarnation System."

"Do you understand now? The power, influence, and goals behind us, and the future profits they entail, are all far beyond your imagination."

"The strength of the Evil God Kings has never been inferior to that of the Eight Divisions Great Gods."

Hearing the Joy God's words, the Nascent Soul True Monarchs within the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map fell silent, unsure whether they were stunned by the content of this revelation or simply disbelieved the intelligence.

The Joy God continued, "Zhang Yu, all of you, consider this carefully. The chance to join us at this moment might be the greatest opportunity of your lives, a tailwind like never before..."

Just then, Zhang Yu interrupted, "Even if I were to consider this, I would only negotiate with the highest-ranking Evil God here... Are you truly the highest-ranking Evil God of the Righteous Qi Alliance? For some reason, you don't seem like it to me."

The Joy God snorted coldly upon hearing this. "I've already answered that question. And I hope you understand the situation: we are offering you an opportunity, not inviting you to make demands."

Zhang Yu pressed on, "Are there any other Evil Gods besides you? Even when looking for a job, both sides have to interview and screen each other. How much more so for something as significant as becoming an Evil God Worshipper?"

The Joy God replied icily, "Then you can just wait here until this great battle is over, until we've divided up all your assets. Then you can choose..."

At that moment, the Auspicious God's voice rang out: "I think Zhang Yu has a point. When becoming a believer, one should indeed choose a master carefully and compare the benefits. It would be foolish to blindly follow a useless boss."
