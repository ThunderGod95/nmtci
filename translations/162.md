# Chapter 162: Zhang Yu's Digestive Power!

Another minor god commented, "This Meng Tao eats very fast, but without the support of his Gluttony spiritual root, his body alone can't digest it all. He'll only get slower and slower."

Huang Zichou said, "Indeed. This trial requires you to digest as you eat. Eating fast is useless; the key is who can digest the fastest."

As he spoke, Dai Xingzhi suddenly stood up, rubbed his bulging stomach, and asked, "Examiner, where is the restroom?"

A beam of light illuminated a previously inconspicuous area on the side of the examination field, revealing the doors of more than a dozen restrooms.

Dai Xingzhi took a deep breath, and in the next moment, the muscles all over his body tensed as he shot toward the restrooms like an arrow.

In the first second, he rushed into the restroom.

In the second second, a series of loud noises echoed from within.

In the third second, he was already walking out, fastening his pants.

He had completed the entire process in just three seconds.

Such astonishing speed, powerful gastrointestinal strength, and digestive ability instantly shocked many students present.

To be able to go that quickly, what kind of powerful physique was that?

Looking at his rank of 10th place, Dai Xingzhi returned to his seat, picked up a large barrel of synthetic food, and began to eat voraciously again.

He thought to himself, _Hmph, many students don't seem to have realized that eating capacity represents a cultivator's metabolism and digestive ability._

_And digestion... is not just about eating the food._

Not far away, Meng Tao watched this scene with a jolt of alarm. "Crap."

As a long-time user of the Gluttony spiritual root, Meng Tao was the type of student who could grow stronger even from eating shit.

In order to become stronger, he spent a great deal of time eating every day.

This had given him a digestive system more adapted to massive food intake, allowing him to swallow more food in a short period.

But without his Gluttony spiritual root, he couldn't digest food as quickly as usual.

In fact, because he relied so heavily on his spiritual root, he discovered that his own digestive abilities were underdeveloped, possibly even weaker than other students.

Seeing several other students rush towards the restrooms while his own stomach felt nothing, Meng Tao grew increasingly anxious.

_Damn it!_

_Right now, I don't even feel the slightest urge to go to the restroom._

_How am I supposed to win like this?_

_How can I possibly win?_

Watching his rank drop to 5th place in an instant and then start to fall towards 6th, Meng Tao felt a wave of helplessness.

At the same time, another person on the field felt this sense of urgency.

Zhang Yu frowned and thought to himself, _Damn it, the rich have stronger bodies... are they even faster at using the restroom than the poor? This world is so unfair!_

By circulating his Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, Zhang Yu's digestive tract acted like a giant millstone, rapidly grinding down every mouthful of synthetic food he swallowed.

Although eating the synthetic food made him want to vomit, he had still magic powerged to climb to a good position at 17th place.

But as more and more food residue accumulated in his stomach and his digestive efficiency decreased, Zhang Yu's eating speed also began to slow down.

Not only did he drop to 18th place in an instant, but he was also getting closer and closer to 19th.

Seeing his ranking in jeopardy and feeling the mounting pressure, Zhang Yu did not panic. Instead, he decided to observe what his opponents were doing.

He turned his head to look at the 19th place contestant behind him, wanting to see what they were up to.

He discovered it was number 36, Li Tongyun, who had competed with him in the previous round.

As Li Tongyun gulped down the synthetic food, a layer of milky-white, viscous substance began to appear on her skin, which then quickly evaporated under her body heat, leaving behind white marks.

Huang Zichou commented, "Is that a digestive system modification surgery? It allows her to metabolize waste through her sweat glands."

Another minor god added, "Normally, it shouldn't excrete such a milky-white substance."

"In its current state, the protein content in her sweat is probably too high, even creating surface tension and making it look very viscous."

Huang Zichou said, "Simply put, she can't digest this much protein and is in a state of indigestion."

"So, to continue eating, she has chosen to excrete the waste before it's fully digested, which is what you would call..."

Deng Bingding finished, "Diarrhea."

Did diarrhea count as cheating? All the gods present looked at Deng Bingding, awaiting the chief examiner's ruling.

Deng Bingding pondered for a moment before saying, "It can be considered a form of bodily control. Let's just go by the rankings."

After finishing a large barrel of synthetic food, Li Tongyun looked at her rank, now 18th, and felt a surge of excitement.

She thought to herself, _It's a good thing I got this digestive tract modification surgery when I had the money. I should be able to rank in the top twenty in this round._

_If I keep this up and focus on eating without worrying about going to the restroom, I should be able to climb a few more spots, step by step._

Watching Li Tongyun having diarrhea while she ate, Zhang Yu knew he couldn't learn that trick.

At the same time, dropping to 19th place made him feel even greater challenge and pressure.

But he still didn't rush or act impulsively. Instead, he continued to observe the other contestants, looking for inspiration and solutions.

_What the hell is wrong with Zhen?_

Seeing Bai Zhenzhen's wildly expanding stomach, Zhang Yu was momentarily stunned, then he realized, _That girl's Thunderclap True Body has tempered her body to be extremely resilient to adapt to high speeds._

_Is she just stuffing herself with food, relying on that astonishing resilience? Has she given up on rapid digestion?_

Looking at her rank of 20th place, Zhang Yu felt worried for her but could do nothing.

Next, Zhang Yu looked at Yu Xinghan in 16th place and noticed his stomach was pulsating, emitting a croaking sound.

Huang Zichou said in the righteous gods' network, "Is this Yu Xinghan using the Great Toad Qi? He even cultivated a technique specifically for digestion?"

Deng Bingding commented, "He is a Golden Core disciple, after all. Although this Yu Xinghan isn't outstanding in any particular area, he is well-balanced with almost no weaknesses. Take eating, for example. Many students don't pay much attention to it, thinking that just eating well is enough."

"But in reality, having a body tempering cultivation technique that specifically aids digestion allows one to gain more nourishment from each meal, putting them slightly ahead of others."

"Over time, this accumulates into a terrifying gap."

Zhang Yu couldn't understand what Yu Xinghan was doing, so he simply swept his gaze towards the second-ranked Yun Jing, wanting to see what this top high school student from the Immortal Capital was doing.

He saw that while Yun Jing was continuously pouring food into the large hole in his chest, his entire body was bright red, and the air around him was slightly distorted by the high temperature.

Amidst waves of heat, puffs of black smoke continuously spewed from his mouth and the pores of his skin, leaving Zhang Yu dumbfounded.

Huang Zichou said, "This Yun Jing's digestive system is very impressive, like an alchemy furnace. All the food he swallows is refined by the high temperature in his stomach, and the impurities are expelled as black smoke."

"If he wanted to, he could keep eating until he runs out of stamina."

"As expected, these top-tier students don't need to use the restroom."

Another minor god beside him said, "That's not necessarily true. Look at Ye Lingxiao."

Ye Lingxiao was still in his initial eating state. As a small giant, he was gulping down the synthetic food from the barrel, showing no change at all, not even his stomach had gotten any bigger.

The minor god said, "The Ye clan's perfect bloodline allows for almost perfect absorption of food. Very little food residue is left after each meal."

"It's said that they only need to use the restroom once a year."

"The sheer amount of stamina and time saved is the envy of countless people."

"Hehe, I wonder how many people want to study the miraculous properties of their bloodline each year."

Zhang Yu couldn't understand Yun Jing's smoke-spewing technique, but seeing Ye Lingxiao's still and silent eating state gave him an idea.

_Even though his body has gotten bigger, the amount he's eaten has clearly far exceeded the size of his stomach... could he be holding it in?_

The more Zhang Yu thought about it, the more plausible it seemed. Especially under the immense pressure, he felt his mind racing, and inspiration struck.

_If he can hold it in, so can I._

So, Zhang Yu forcefully contracted his stomach and intestines, trying to compress the volume of the food residue to make more space to continue eating.

At first, this seemed to work, and Zhang Yu felt a slight sense of excitement.

But soon, as he ate more, he found that the newly created space was quickly being filled up again.

_It's not enough... the power of my stomach and intestines alone is not enough._

_Then..._

Zhang Yu suddenly slapped his own stomach. With a loud thud, the terrifying force of his palm penetrated his skin and stomach wall, directly striking the food he had swallowed.

Dragon-Elephant Mountain-Shattering Palm, Level 10 activation!

At this moment, Zhang Yu was striking his own body with palm after palm, intending to use the Dragon-Elephant Mountain-Shattering Palm to aid his digestion!

This scene quickly caught the attention of the other students around him.

Meng Tao, who had fallen to ninth place, was stunned at first, then a flicker of joy appeared on his face. _There's a way like this?_

He quickly followed suit, striking his own stomach with one palm after another.

At first, the force of the palm strikes did indeed pulverize and compress the food, speeding up his eating.

But soon, he felt a dull ache in his internal organs and found it difficult to continue.

_I can't go on..._ Meng Tao couldn't help but turn to look at Zhang Yu. _Just how tough are this guy's internal organs? Can he really keep this up?_

But Zhang Yu was now completely immersed in tempering his own body.

Under his full concentration, every piece of flesh, every bone, and every organ in his body was crystal clear to him.

With each palm strike, his body moved as if countless masters were coordinating, constantly guiding, shifting, and dissipating the force, transferring the vast majority of the impact to the food inside him.

At this moment, it was as if palm prints appeared on the walls of his intestines and stomach, fiercely striking the food he had swallowed.

_Pulverize... compress..._

_Pulverize again... compress again..._

One after another, Level 10 martial arts, combined with the bodily control he had gained from past breakthroughs... Zhang Yu was now using all of it against himself.

_Hmph, in terms of magic power control, I haven't made much progress in a long time._

_But when it comes to physical control techniques, even among these young masters from the Immortal Capital... there probably aren't many who are stronger than me._

At this moment, with his powerful control over his body, Zhang Yu had elevated his digestive ability far beyond the limits of his physical strength.
