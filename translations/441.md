# Chapter 441: Zhang Yu, What Makes You Think You Can Compete with Me?

Though the arena appeared empty, the Spirit Realm and live streams had drawn countless spectators, their collective consciousness converging on the event.

Su Yanyang watched the competition, thinking to himself, "This clash between the Coin Dao's two Heavenly Chosen will come down to who has deeper pockets. Either way, it's sure to drive more people to buy Jade Nectar Coins."

His gaze shifted to Ji Yuanshu, standing beside Ping Han. "No wonder he wants to transfer to the Finance Department," Su Yanyang mused. "He's got the perfect gambling spirit."

Just then, Su Yanyang overheard Zhang Yu and Ping Han's conversation. As Zhang Yu once again denied trading coins, a flicker of doubt crossed Su Yanyang's face. "Is he telling the truth, or is this just another act?"

Behind Ping Han, Ji Yuanshu stood with his four teammates. Watching Ping Han confront Zhang Yu, Ji Yuanshu had briefly considered leaving the team after Ping Han joined. But he quickly realized something: "The outcome of this battle no longer matters!"

Both sides had invested in Jade Nectar Coins. Regardless of who won, the conflict would only fuel the fire, making the Jade Nectar Market even more popular within Myriad Laws University.

Realizing this, Ji Yuanshu immediately spent every last coin he had, leveraging it all into a 100x margin position on Jade Nectar Coins.

Having exhausted his last reserves of Immortal Dao potential, Ji Yuanshu knew he couldn't switch to another team. He simply didn't have the money to buy a substitute position on another squad.

"It doesn't matter," he muttered. "As long as I make a fortune on this Jade Nectar Coin surge, I can slowly catch up in the overall rankings."

"The Competition is held every year, but opportunities like this to make a killing don't come around often!"

Many shared this sentiment, until Zhang Yu spoke to Ping Han and declared he wouldn't invest in the coins.

Zhang Yu himself was growing weary of the rumors circulating these past few days.

"Who the hell started this rumor that I'm trading Jade Nectar Coins with 100x leverage?!"

Remembering Director Gao's instructions, Zhang Yu raised his voice and shouted, "The value of Jade Nectar Coins is unstable! It relies too heavily on market confidence and is overly concentrated in the hands of Joyful Union University, making it easily manipulated!"

"I wouldn't touch such a high-risk investment!"

"Ping Han, I advise you to cash out while you're ahead and avoid bankruptcy again!"

"The longer Jade Nectar Coins keep rising, the greater the risk becomes!"

Ping Han hadn't even responded to Zhang Yu's outburst when the Spirit Realm erupted in chaos.

Someone immediately spent spirit stones to project lines of text above Zhang Yu's head:

"You didn't warn us when the Jade Nectar Coin was fluctuating for years, but now that everyone's making money, you suddenly issue a warning?"

"If you don't trade coins, what are you blathering about? Can't you keep your mouth shut about things you don't understand?"

"How did someone like that even get a Military Certificate? It's a disgrace to Myriad Laws University."

"The Seven Emotions Coin skyrocketed without any warnings about risks, but you're warning us about the Jade Nectar Coin after it's only been rising for a short time?"

"Will Zhang Yu dare to reveal his own holdings?"

If the students watching earlier had been laughing and chatting, the Spirit Realm now resembled a raging storm. Countless streams of malice converged on Zhang Yu, as if determined to tear him to shreds.

Zhang Yu glanced at the lines of text floating above his head and the streams of information pouring from his Bionic Eye, shaking his head helplessly.

Lady Fortune chuckled, "You're bound to get roasted for hitting the brakes now!"

Zhang Yu shrugged. "Whatever. Director Gao told me to issue the warning, so I did. Their insults can't hurt me anyway."

In stark contrast, Ping Han raised his hand, and the torrent of abuse in the Spirit Realm instantly subsided.

Pointing to the coin price charts above his head with one hand and the Jade Nectar Coin price display on his chest with the other, Ping Han declared, "While Zhang Yu was spouting nonsense, our Jade Nectar Coin gained another 0.01 Spirit Coins!"

"Oh..."

A thunderous roar of cheers erupted in the Spirit Realm!

Ping Han spread his arms wide, as if embracing the void, and declared with unwavering confidence, "Everyone, when the Jade Nectar Coin was at 0.1 Spirit Coin, some doubted it would ever rise!"

"When it reached 1 Spirit Coin, they predicted its downfall!"

"Even at 10 Spirit Coins, many urged me to cash out!"

"But as proven by reality, they were all wrong!"

"We've triumphed thus far, and our winning streak will continue!"

As Ping Han spoke, the projection displaying the entry method for his Investment Guidance Group behind him glowed brighter!

The cheers in the Spirit Realm intensified!

Above Ping Han, a torrent of text materialized, projected by spectators throwing virtual currency:

"Jade Nectar Coin to 10,000 Spirit Coins!"

"Ping Han, crush that loudmouth!"

"I want to see Zhang Yu brought to his knees!"

In an instant, the tide turned. The audience's support for Ping Han mirrored their fury toward Zhang Yu!

Soon, the attacks against Zhang Yu broadened to target the entire Competition Team!

Che Yufei, Shi Yunxiang, and others watched the rapidly scrolling information in their Bionic Eyes.

In that instant, both teams felt the fury and hostility of countless spectators.

Shi Yunxiang's head buzzed. "Why did Zhang Yu have to provoke them?" he wondered.

Yu Xinghan surveyed the Spirit Realm, noting, "There's definitely a lot of astroturfing going on here."

The referee's signal sent both teams, who had been waiting at the entrance, surging onto the field.

To cut costs as the competition's intensity escalated, the original two-round format had been condensed into a single round.

Both teams would simultaneously construct their structures while defending against each other's attacks. The team with the most complete structure at the end would win.

Upon reaching the construction site, Ping Han turned to Ji Yuanshu and the other three teammates. "You four stay here and build. I'll handle the rest myself!"

Without waiting for their response, he vanished in a blur, streaking toward Zhang Yu's position.

Ping Han had no interest in leading his team. He wanted to crush Zhang Yu personally, and if possible, take down Zhang Yu's entire team in the process.

He wanted those experts, professors, and university leaders to open their eyes and see clearly: he was the most deserving recipient of this year's Civil Engineering Department's Military Certificate!

Meanwhile, as he watched the constant stream of group join notifications in his Bionic Eye, he realized this was an excellent opportunity to promote himself and his Investment Guidance Group.

"Zhang Yu, thank you for criticizing the Jade Nectar Coin!"

The more you attack it, the faster it will grow — and the faster I will grow!

On the other side, Ji Yuanshu watched Ping Han's retreating figure, feeling the surging Qi Luck of the world. It was the growing support of the masses!

He marveled inwardly, "I'm merely Ping Han's teammate, yet I'm already benefiting from this much Qi Luck. How much more would a true Fusion-type prodigy or someone like Divine Monarch Jade Nectar gain every moment?"

---

When Ping Han arrived at the arena, he found Zhang Yu standing alone.

"Just you?" Ping Han asked coldly.

"One is enough," Zhang Yu replied calmly.

Zhang Yu understood this was Director Gao's intention as well.

If Zhang Yu needed his teammates' help to defeat Ping Han, how could he prove the true value of his Military Certificate?

As Zhang Yu faced Ping Han, he guessed his opponent had a similar plan.

Knowing many were watching the live broadcast, Ping Han deliberately raised his voice and shouted, "Zhang Yu! They say you won against me in the Military Certificate Examination Field because you killed more enemies!"

"Today, we won't compete in construction. Let's see who's the better fighter!"

With that, Ping Han clasped his hands together and unleashed a devastating palm strike.

The earth beneath his feet surged like a tsunami, a massive wave of mud and sand surging toward Zhang Yu.

Facing Ping Han's attack, Zhang Yu shifted his palm technique and countered with the Minor Threefold Combination.

His downward palm strike met the oncoming torrent of mud and sand as if struck by an invisible giant hand. With a thunderous boom, the earth exploded, sending plumes of smoke and dust billowing skyward, spreading in all directions.

The clash between the two began with a direct confrontation of their Minor Threefold Combinations.

The ground trembled, mud and sand soared into the sky, and deafening explosions shook the battlefield. At the center of the conflict, it was as if two colossal beasts were tearing at each other, unleashing endless sandstorms that plunged the world into chaos.

"Good."

With a thunderous roar, Ping Han abruptly dispersed the swirling dust and smoke that filled the sky.

"It wasn't for nothing that I specially prepared this for you!"

"This money wasn't wasted!"

Several streaks of light pierced through the dust cloud, hurtling directly toward Ping Han's position.

Amidst crackling explosions, the luminous figures revealed a dazzling metallic sheen. They coiled around Ping Han's body like living entities.

"Armor?" Zhang Yu's eyes narrowed as he recognized the object encasing Ping Han.

Armor was an ancient type of equipment that had existed since time immemorial. Though Zhang Yu knew of it, it was exceedingly rare in Kunxu.

This was because armor was a specialized magical artifact designed solely for combat, its narrow application making it irrelevant to most people in Kunxu.

Ping Han said coldly, "Correct. This Heavenly Abyss Armor was specially prepared for this battle!"

Ping Han was now completely covered in thick black armor. The armor's surface glowed with the patterns of the celestial sphere, corresponding to the thirty-six major meridians of the human body. As Ping Han's Magic Power flowed through his body, streams of Gang Qi erupted from the armor.

At the armor's joints, intricate dragon-like patterns of vital energy channels faintly emerged, radiating waves of heat. Zhang Yu, observing this spectacle, understood that every structural detail of the armor — its greater volume and heavier weight — represented superior Magic Power reserves, more modular functions, and a higher Immortal Dao output, advantages far beyond the capabilities of a mere human-sized Bionic!

Whoosh.

With a deep breath, Ping Han exhaled streams of scorching air that raised the surrounding temperature significantly.

Simultaneously, the coin prices and trend charts previously projected onto Ping Han's body now shifted to the armor's exterior.

As the price of 16.88 flashed once more on Ping Han's chest, cheers erupted in the Spirit Realm. Countless voices rallied behind Ping Han, rooting for the Jade Nectar Coin!

"Zhang Yu," Ping Han declared, "the Immortal Dao thrives on currency. Without trading coins, your innate earning potential is inferior to mine, and your ceiling for Immortal Dao potential is lower. What makes you think you can compete with me?"
