# Chapter 502: The Strongest Civil Engineering Student

A deafening roar shook the earth as Zhang Yu was slammed into the ground. Xiang Shan tore through the earth and stone, relentlessly pursuing him underground.

The two clashed repeatedly in the subterranean depths. As Zhang Yu struggled to withstand Xiang Shan's relentless assault, Xiang Shan sneered, "Still waiting for your teammates to build a Formation for you?"

"Don't bother waiting."

"With every strike, every tremor in the earth, I've amplified the vibrations to their maximum. They won't have a chance to build anything."

After another collision, Zhang Yu's form faltered, then exploded into fragments.

During their fierce exchange, Zhang Yu had secretly switched to using Humanoid Gang Qi to mimic the Mountain-Moving Warrior.

This was possible because the Mountain-Moving Warrior he manifested was a scaled-down version, not much larger than his own body, allowing him to split off a significant portion of his Gang Qi to create the clones.

Xiang Shan scoffed, "Think that will help?"

In the next instant, he whirled around and struck Zhang Yu, who had launched a surprise attack from behind.

Throughout their relentless struggle, Humanoid Gang Qi clones were repeatedly shattered by Xiang Shan's blows, each sacrifice providing cover for Zhang Yu's true form.

Unbeknownst to them, their fierce battle had carved out a massive cavern beneath the earth.

Suddenly, the entire cavern trembled violently. Countless earthen and stone fragments coalesced into colossal arms, each clenched into fists or spread into palms, converging upon Xiang Shan in a deadly encirclement.

Mountain-Shifting Nine Heavens! Thousand-Handed Sacred Martial!

Drawing upon the Mountain-Shifting Divine Power as its foundation, supplemented by the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force's absorbed energy, the technique unleashed its full might in a single, devastating surge.

In that moment, Xiang Shan seemed to be besieged by countless formidable warriors.

Yet facing the hundreds, even thousands, of colossal arms, Xiang Shan met each blow with his own fists, shattering them one by one with brute force.

"Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!"

With each furious roar, Xiang Shan's skin erupted with even more ferocious counterattacks as he was struck, transforming him into a rampaging behemoth determined to tear apart everything before him.

Beneath this savage exterior, however, his mind remained ice-cold. He continuously released fiend energy from his trunk, saturating the entire battlefield with its toxic aura.

"Fiend energy... is an environment saturated with toxins and pollution."

"For me, who has lived in such conditions since birth, it's like a fish in water."

"But for you humans, it's an unbearable negative impact..."

"Construction is impossible in this constantly shaking environment, and the suffocating pollution is an even greater burden."

Xiang Shan said calmly, "The environment is becoming increasingly hostile to you."

"Your combat capabilities have been completely crushed by me."

"How much longer do you think you can survive by hiding and dodging like this?"

As he spoke, Xiang Shan's elephant ears perked up. He continued, "Do you hear that? The entire arena is cheering for my victory!"

"Behind me stand the hopes of countless Monsterfolk, and the clinking of countless... Spirit Coins!"

With a thunderous roar, numbers began to float above Xiang Shan's head.

5.56 Spirit Coins!

12.34 Spirit Coins!

22.79 Spirit Coins!

Xiang Shan roared, "See that? These are the rewards given to me by countless Monsterfolk watching live and online!"

"This is the bond of our Monsterfolk!"

"My teammates sacrificed for me, my kin burned for me, my classmates are throwing money at me..."

"In combat prowess, environmental adaptation, and backing support... you're all inferior to me. What the hell are you even fighting for? How much more money are you planning to waste?!"

Simultaneously, messages from the Spirit Realm began to materialize above the arena.

"Don't worry about post-match medical or maintenance fees! We've got you covered!"

"Change Celestial Monsters! Today's the day!"

"Devour them all!"

In the next instant, Xiang Shan roared and crushed another Humanoid Gang Qi into dust.

Pressuring his opponents with verbal taunts during combat was a common tactic for Xiang Shan.

Though he appeared arrogant, his mind remained calm as he relentlessly sought Zhang Yu's weaknesses.

"Found you."

Xiang Shan's gaze sharpened as a massive wave of Elephant Monster Soul Cultivators from the Spirit Realm surged toward Zhang Yu's Bionic.

Driven by hopes of changing Celestial Monsters, securing Xiang Shan's place on the school team, and realizing dreams of lower Reproduction Taxes and higher incomes, they frantically charged into Zhang Yu's Seven Absolutes Bionic.

But moments later, they began to show surprise.

Xiang Shan asked, "Why hasn't the opponent's Bionic been paralyzed yet?"

The Soul Cultivators replied: "They've thrown an insane amount of Spirit Coins at this. They're fighting like their lives depend on it. We need more time."

Xiang Shan: "Fighting like their lives depend on it? More than you guys?"

In the Spirit Realm:

Zhao Tianxing roared inwardly: "To hell with some stupid clan, university, or major... I'm fighting for my job!"

Mo Tianyi: "We finally found a good company! A good job! Don't you dare ruin this for us!"

Ying Xin's Grandfather: "What bullshit school team... We're joining the Artifact Refinement Department with Zhang Yu! All you Civil Engineering dogs can die!"

Che Yufei: "We're Soul Cultivators working for the Artifact Refinement Department!"

Hu Yuntao: "We finally found a human company that doesn't discriminate against Monsterfolk! Get out of our boss's way, you filthy monsters!"

Meanwhile, on the other side of the arena, at the construction site:

A vast expanse of earth floated silently a few inches above the ground, like a floating island, untouched by the earthquake.

Massive amounts of earth and stone were continuously being added to this floating island construction site, powered by Zhang Yu's Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

Simultaneously, Xiao Yunji, transformed into a train on the floating island, swiftly transported the earth and stone Zhang Yu had remotely delivered to every corner of the site.

Su Yanyang and Shi Huaiyu worked together, employing the Minor Threefold Combination to continuously construct the framework and refine the overall structure.

"Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!" Shi Huaiyu shouted. "Zhang Yu can't hold out much longer!"

Xiao Qingxuan, surrounded by streams of dragon-shaped Gang Qi, transformed into countless workers, meticulously completing the steel reinforcement and concrete work within the structure.

The long-accumulated ashes of the Ying Family were scattered throughout the floating island, permeating every corner.

Shi Huaiyu snapped, "Su Yanyang! Move faster!"

---

On the battlefield, Zhang Yu's Gang Qi grew increasingly faint in Xiang Shan's perception.

Simultaneously, in the Spirit Realm, the Soul Cultivators were advancing rapidly, poised to cripple Zhang Yu's Seven Absolutes Bionic.

Sensing all this, Xiang Shan coldly remarked, "It's time to end this."

But in that instant, he abruptly looked up to see a colossal floating island hurtling toward him from the sky.

Xiang Shan's gaze sharpened. "A floating island? An Anti-Gravity Formation? This scale... So, while battling me, Zhang Yu was remotely supporting the construction site?"

"No wonder he mostly just took hits without retaliating."

At the same moment, the sky-obscuring island, carrying earth-shattering force, crashed down upon Xiang Shan.

As Xiang Shan tried to evade, he felt an irresistible gravitational pull dragging him down.

"You!" Xiang Shan's eyes widened in surprise as Zhang Yu, in the final moments before his Seven Absolutes Bionic was crippled, unleashed the Eternal Calamity Abyss he had long been preparing, temporarily immobilizing Xiang Shan.

With a thunderous crash, the entire floating island plummeted to the ground.

The moment Xiang Shan broke free from the Eternal Calamity Abyss, he was relentlessly forced deeper into the earth.

He roared, straining his arms to tear apart the floating island before him, but encountered astonishing resistance.

The entire floating island pressing down on him felt like countless layers of armored structures stacked upon each other, far exceeding the durability of ordinary earth and stone.

Xiang Shan frowned. "Overengineered construction, reinforced by multiple defensive Formations, and... some kind of bone ash? Blood sacrifice?"

Despite his immense strength, only a small portion of the structure shattered before him, allowing him to pierce into the floating island like a needle.

With another roar, he spread his arms wide, relentlessly destroying layer after layer of the structure.

Meanwhile, the Soul Cultivators returned, reporting their battle results.

"The Seven Absolutes Bionic has been paralyzed."

"But Zhang Yu voluntarily disengaged from the Bionic."

---

Above the floating island, the Myriad Laws Team members worked in unison, continuously pouring layers of reinforced concrete and channeling Spirit Veins using the power of the Minor Threefold Combination.

Su Yanyang, sensing the situation below, exclaimed in alarm, "He's too fast! Xiang Shan is breaking through too quickly! We can't hold him back!"

*Slap!*

Shi Huaiyu slapped Su Yanyang on the head, snarling, "Stop spouting nonsense! Where's your fighting spirit? Hold on!"

Su Yanyang took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, and clasped his hands together. The ground beneath his feet surged under the influence of the Minor Threefold Combination, molding layers of reinforced concrete into shape.

"Faster! Faster!" Xiao Yunji's figure flickered as she teleported materials at high speed across the floating island.

Xiao Qingxuan frowned deeply, sensing Xiang Shan's relentless advance within the island. His breakthrough speed far outstripped their construction rate.

Just as everyone was on edge, the sky suddenly darkened.

Zhang Yu appeared, temporarily using golden Gang Qi as limbs to remotely seize massive quantities of earth, stone, and Living Stakes, bringing reinforcements from afar.

"After Zhang Yu detached from the Seven Absolutes Bionic..." Su Yanyang's eyes lit up. "Did he transport the soil, rocks, materials, and Living Stakes from Celestial Monsters University?"

With Zhang Yu's transportation support and the Living Stakes being driven into the earth, the efficiency and quality of the entire construction site surged dramatically.

Xiang Shan, trapped within the floating island — or rather, the floating mountain — gradually sensed something was amiss.

The mountain's structure grew increasingly rigid and heavy.

Despite breaking through hundreds of meters, he still hadn't reached the end...

"No! I can't be trapped here!"

Xiang Shan roared furiously, channeling all his strength into another desperate advance.

But at that moment, he suddenly realized... his Military-Grade Bionic offered absolutely no assistance in demolition or construction.

Meanwhile, the construction site above grew even more frenzied.

"Steel!" Xiao Qingxuan bellowed, slamming massive steel bars into the modules.

With Su Yanyang's Bionic operating at 100% capacity, torrents of concrete erupted like a mountain flood, engulfing the steel reinforcement.

"Hold on! He's slowing down!" Shi Huaiyu excitedly manipulated the Spirit Vein, constantly adjusting the mountain's external structural supports in response to the internal destruction.

In the sky, earth and rock from the entire battlefield flew toward Zhang Yu, drawn by his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. Some of the material transformed into construction materials and fell into the construction site, while the rest visibly rushed to fill the gaps in the mountain.

Xiang Shan felt the weight pressing down on him grow heavier, his movements slowing.

His Military-Grade Skin Bionic, designed for combat, couldn't improve his efficiency in demolishing the mountain. Instead, it drained his Magic Power at an alarming rate.

A sudden realization flashed through his mind: "In direct combat, I surpass them. The logic is simple, like a basic math problem... Two Military-Grade powers are greater than one."

"But when it comes to construction efficiency, like modifying the mountain right now..."

Xiang Shan's face twisted with frustration, his eyes burning with resentment. "Could I actually be inferior to them? The Calamity Flow Bright King Type Four isn't a construction Bionic; it's a combat Bionic... Absorbing power and countering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power — none of that helps me demolish this mountain... Could I...?"

"Impossible!" Xiang Shan roared. "After sacrificing so much? How could I fall here? How could I possibly fall here?!"

The mountain trembled violently as the internal structure collapsed under the relentless struggle between the two sides, while the exterior was continuously reinforced and filled in.

When light finally flooded his vision, Xiang Shan's hands found empty air. He had finally breached the entire mountain and emerged into the outside world.

But before a smile could even form on his face, the competition's end notification flashed across his Bionic Eye.

Competition Ended

Myriad Laws University Completion Rate: 43%

Celestial Monsters University Completion Rate: 0%

Just before the deadline, Zhang Yu had used his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to shift the construction materials into their designated positions, securing an overwhelming lead in completion rate.

Meanwhile, the Celestial Monsters University's construction site had been utterly destroyed during Zhang Yu's material transport operations.

Xiang Shan froze for a moment, then watched as the Myriad Laws students cheered and embraced each other.

Around them, the Living Stakes crafted by the Monsterfolk stood silently on the earth, just as they had for countless years.

A wave of resentment surged through Xiang Shan's heart as he glared at Zhang Yu.

He had sacrificed his teammates and his clansmen, yet now he could only watch helplessly as Zhang Yu and his companions ascended to the victor's throne.

Meeting Xiang Shan's gaze, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Xiang Shan... you may indeed have reasons to win, even if it means sacrificing your comrades to achieve your goal."

"But I can't betray the trust of my employees and teammates. I want to lead them forward."

Lady Fortune chuckled, "Kunxu is just like this — it gathers all those desperate to fight, then the weak fall and the strong prevail. Isn't that exactly the law of the jungle these Monsterfolk believe in?"

In the Spirit Realm's spectator stands, Director Gao watched the scene unfold and remarked calmly, "Xiang Shan has already strayed from the Righteous Path of Civil Engineering. By relying on a Military-Grade Bionic to enhance his combat power, even if he surpasses Civil Engineering and joins the school team... what does that have to do with Civil Engineering? What does it have to do with construction?"

"After other departments obtain their certifications, can't they also wear Military-Grade Bionics like yours?"

Director Gao then turned his gaze to Zhang Yu, nodding in satisfaction. "Zhang Yu has fully grasped the essence of Civil Engineering. He can truly be considered the current... strongest Civil Engineering student."

Mo Shangjin sent Zhang Yu a message: Where's my Seven Absolutes Bionic?
