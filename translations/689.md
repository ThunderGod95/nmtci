# Chapter 689: Magnetic Pole: This Child Resembles Me

Divine Monarch Tranquility: "Greenwood, do you still have the World-Piercing Cone? Should we protect it together?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood: "I've already placed the World-Piercing Cone in a secure location. There's no need to worry."

Divine Monarch Tranquility gazed at Divine Monarch Greenwood, a hint of admiration creeping into his eyes.

"Greenwood actually managed to borrow the World-Piercing Cone from that stingy Magnetic Pole... That's true skill. He's far more capable than I am in this regard."

"There's much I can learn from him."

In Kunxu, wealth equates to power, prestige, and influence. The source of that wealth is irrelevant.

Whether through dual cultivation, leeching off family, coercion, or exploitation... as long as one acquires wealth and benefits, the Kunxu People consider it a demonstration of competence and a mark of strength.

As a Soul Transformation cultivator, Divine Monarch Tranquility understood this deeply and had always been willing to learn from others' strengths.

In Divine Monarch Tranquility's eyes, Divine Monarch Greenwood's ability to borrow the World-Piercing Cone was a testament to his power — a feat Tranquility himself couldn't achieve.

If possible, Tranquility would have asked Greenwood how he managed to secure such favorable treatment and extract so many benefits from Principal Magnetic Pole.

"If I were to transform myself to resemble Greenwood, would it be easier to obtain funding from Principal Magnetic Pole?"

The saying goes, "What the superiors favor, their subordinates will pursue with fervor." To Divine Monarch Tranquility, this was perfectly natural.

Since Divine Monarch Greenwood could secure advantages under Principal Magnetic Pole's leadership, Myriad Laws University would inevitably see a rise in Greenwood imitators, leading to shifts in etiquette, aesthetics, and customs.

Tranquility understood that this was the radiation emanating from the most powerful figure in the organization, a subtle yet pervasive influence that would reshape the entire group. To climb the ranks or maintain his high position, he needed to adapt to these changes and align himself with this influence.

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Cloud Haven's face was wreathed in smiles, showing no trace of the anger he had displayed earlier when trying to dissuade Divine Monarch Greenwood. He began inquiring about the World-Piercing Cone: "Greenwood, has the World-Piercing Cone been fully repaired? Will it be mass-produced now?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood shook his head. "Let Principal Magnetic Pole announce the specifics."

Divine Monarch Cloud Haven continued, "Will we be able to borrow the World-Piercing Cone in the future? We're willing to pay — how about 1,000 Spirit Coins per use?"

Behind the three Divine Monarchs, Zhang Yu nearly blurted out, "Deal!"

But recalling his experiences on the battlefield that day, he shook his head and suppressed the impulse.

"Soul Transformation..."

The sheer gulf between his current Nascent Soul Realm and the Soul Transformation Realm was evident in their fundamental stats.

For instance, the maximum Magic Power for the Nascent Soul Realm was 100,000, while the Soul Transformation Realm boasted a staggering 1,000,000. Zhang Yu currently possessed just over 30,000 Magic Power, and even with the temporary boost from "Boundless Magic Power," his limit barely exceeded 40,000.

The absolute disparity in Magic Power alone left Zhang Yu utterly defenseless against the Soul Transformation experts' relentless assault.

Recalling the overwhelming power of the Soul Transformation cultivators on the battlefield today, Zhang Yu felt a chill run down his spine.

"Just a few exchanges drained my Magic Power completely."

"Each of these Soul Transformation experts possesses a unique ultimate technique. In addition to their military-grade cultivation arts honed over decades, they also wield Immortal Sect Techniques as their trump cards."

"Facing them now, my only option is to rely on Kunlun in the Palm and the Immortal Descendant's resilience to endure their attacks."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "If it weren't for Teacher Gao's foresight in deploying a concealment formation beforehand, I would have been captured."

With the World-Piercing Cone's two deployments, Zhang Yu could sense the risks were escalating.

"After this battle, the Righteous Qi Alliance will undoubtedly prioritize the World-Piercing Cone even more. Next time it's deployed, we'll likely face an even greater number of Soul Transformation experts."

"Unless my strength undergoes a breakthrough, the World-Piercing Cone can't be used lightly again."

Just as Divine Monarch Greenwood was single-handedly charging into the enemy's formation, within the sealed conference room of the Ten Universities Soul Transformation Experts, the ten Soul Transformation experts continued their fierce debate. The conflict escalated as Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus exchanged increasingly aggressive attacks. The repeated clashes of their powers made it seem as though the conference room might transform into a battlefield at any moment.

As the tension reached a boiling point, a divine light suddenly pierced through the room's defenses and burst inside.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus sneered at the newcomer. "Azure Void, since when did you have the right to enter this place?"

With a flick of his wide sleeve, he attempted to sweep Divine Monarch Azure Void out of the conference room.

But in a flash of fiery light, Heavenly Sun Radiance God's massive hand intercepted Sinful Lotus's sleeve, blocking the attack.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said coldly, "Sinful Lotus, my subordinates are none of your concern."

Sinful Lotus scoffed. "Magnetic Pole, we agreed on a sealed conference. Your people barge in as they please. Do you even respect the authority of the Ten Universities?"

As the other Soul Transformation experts began to show their displeasure, Divine Monarch Azure Void spoke up. "Principal, Divine Monarch Greenwood has successfully deployed the World-Piercing Cone, breaching seven Spatial Barriers and returning safely."

The moment these words were spoken, the Soul Transformation experts present reacted with varied expressions.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, however, was slightly taken aback, thinking, "Has my World-Piercing Cone been deployed again?"

With the closed-door meeting interrupted, the Soul Transformation experts immediately checked their Spirit Realm messages.

As Magnetic Pole read the messages from Zhang Yu and Divine Monarch Greenwood, a hint of tenderness flashed in her eyes. She murmured to herself, "Those two... Did I really need you to risk yourselves to help me? Couldn't you just stay put and hide behind me like good children?"

In the next moment, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets of Immortal Armaments University broke the silence with a hearty laugh. "So, Magnetic Pole, the World-Piercing Cone is already repaired? What game are you playing with us here?"

Magnetic Pole flicked her fingertip lightly and replied calmly, "The World-Piercing Cone's technology is exceedingly complex. I only managed a rough repair and sent someone to test it. Who knew they'd stir up such a commotion?"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's gaze flickered. The four Soul Transformation experts from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools had already exchanged messages in the Spirit Realm and were about to join forces to pressure Magnetic Pole into handing over the World-Piercing Cone when a projection materialized before her.

Magnetic Pole's voice rang out clearly, "If the spatial technology test hadn't succeeded and I lacked sufficient certainty, I wouldn't have bothered mentioning any of this."

"Now that the tests have been successful, let's discuss Spatial Technology today."

"This design blueprint is for a magical artifact I've completely redesigned based on my understanding of Spatial Technology over the past five months."

"Please take a look."

Divine Monarch Great Devourer of Celestial Monsters University was the first to download and examine the blueprint.

"As-You-Wish Size Ring?" she murmured, her interest piqued. As she continued reading, she discovered it was a magical artifact capable of shrinking or enlarging matter using Spatial Technology.

Although the scaling range was limited, Divine Monarch Great Devourer immediately recognized its vast potential.

"What a treasure!" the Mother Dragon thought to herself. "With this artifact, I could transport even more loot each time! Many items previously too cumbersome to carry could now be easily moved, greatly increasing my gains from each sweep of the Third Layer."

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets from Immortal Armaments University had also downloaded the blueprint.

This Refinement Grandmaster, who had spent his life copying countless magical artifacts, instantly grasped the immense potential of the design blueprint provided by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

"A technological revolution! A technological revolution is coming!" Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets exclaimed inwardly, his heart racing. "This will be a complete transformation of transportation, logistics, warfare, production... every aspect of society!"

His excitement grew with each detail he absorbed, until he suddenly erupted in fury. "It's gone? Why does it end here? How am I supposed to copy this?!"

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus was meticulously studying the design blueprint for the As-You-Wish Size Ring. As the former Director of the Artifact Refinement Department at Heavenly Demon University, he effortlessly grasped the underlying principles as he examined the diagrams.

Since the Great Upheaval, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus had been tirelessly collecting data from every corner of the world: recordings of Dao Qiankun's battles, data on the environmental changes caused by the upheaval, intelligence on the World-Piercing Cone... He had been gathering, analyzing, and pondering relentlessly.

With such a wealth of practical examples before him, he was confident that given enough time, he could gradually unravel the mysteries of Spatial Technology.

But time, alas, was always in short supply.

Now, as he studied the design blueprint for the As-You-Wish Size Ring, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus suddenly felt a profound sense of enlightenment.

"So that's how it works?"

"I could design this magical artifact myself."

"No... I could design something better, something more suited to Heavenly Demon University, something more adapted to the current situation..."

As Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus studied the design blueprint, various modification schemes rapidly formed in his mind.

"With this technology, we can simply shrink and enlarge objects to transport massive quantities of materials through the narrow passages created by the Righteous Qi Alliance's Spatial Lockdown. This would completely nullify the enemy's advantage in spatial barrier construction."

But the next moment, as he glanced at the unfinished blueprint, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus felt his overflowing Spirit Inspiration and train of thought abruptly cut off, leaving him so frustrated he nearly vomited blood.

"That's it?"

He immediately looked up and demanded of Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, "Where are the rest of the blueprints?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole replied absently, "Just a moment..."

Her gaze remained fixed on the complete blueprint, her mind racing. "Why does this look more and more like my own design?"

"Zhang Yu... his talent for artifact refinement is so similar to mine?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole could almost see Zhang Yu, day and night, frantically studying everything she had ever done, obsessively copying and imitating her various works.

"He's been living in my shadow all along."

The blueprint before her was utterly captivating. She marveled at its ingenious design and gained profound insights into the applications of Spatial Technology.
