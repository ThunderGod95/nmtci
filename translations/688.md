# Chapter 688: The Spirit Realm Boils, All Sects Tremble

Enveloped in azure divine light, Zhang Yu was carried skyward by Divine Monarch Greenwood.

In an instant, the entire Grand Void unfolded before him. He could see countless streams of light darting back and forth, flowing between the fortresses, strongholds, and towns surrounding the Grand Void, forming a vast, ring-shaped metropolis.

Waves of cultivators and supplies poured into the battlefield like ants moving house, an endless stream fueling the war effort.

Gazing toward the horizon on the Third Layer, Zhang Yu saw intermittent flashes of fire and explosions erupting into the sky, grim reminders of the fierce battles raging at the front lines.

With another flash of divine light, the ground beneath them blurred into a receding landscape as Divine Monarch Greenwood accelerated toward the front lines.

At the same moment, Divine Monarch Greenwood's voice echoed in Zhang Yu's mind.

"The fighting at Magnetic Pole's end is too intense. If we brought the World-Piercing Cone directly there, Soul Transformation experts might try to seize it and forcibly inspect it."

"Even with my and Magnetic Pole's protection, the truth about the World-Piercing Cone could be exposed."

"That's why I won't take you directly to Magnetic Pole. Instead, we'll go to the battlefield to test the World-Piercing Cone's capabilities and relieve some pressure on Magnetic Pole."

Zhang Yu nodded in agreement. "Teacher, since breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, I've gained a new understanding of Spatial Technology. I've even drafted a design blueprint for a magical artifact."

Divine Monarch Greenwood's eyes lit up as he examined the design blueprint Zhang Yu sent. "Oh? Excellent! With this artifact of your design, combined with the World-Piercing Cone's proven capabilities, negotiations with Magnetic Pole and the other nine Soul Transformation experts will be much smoother."

Zhang Yu continued, "Teacher, why not let my true form enter the World-Piercing Cone as well?"

"Are you aware," Divine Monarch Greenwood cautioned, "that we might face Soul Transformation experts in battle soon?"

"Teacher, I'm not afraid," Zhang Yu replied. "My Nascent Soul and I can coordinate our efforts more effectively together. Hiding together within the World-Piercing Cone will also make us harder to detect."

Divine Monarch Greenwood nodded without hesitation. "Very well. Since you're willing to take the risk, I won't be overly cautious. As long as I'm here, I won't let anything happen to you — unless I die first."

As Divine Monarch Greenwood and his disciple exchanged words, his actions had already drawn the attention of many.

Divine Monarch Tranquility of Myriad Laws University immediately contacted him, asking, "Greenwood, what are you planning?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood chuckled. "I'm going to reinforce the front lines."

Simultaneously, he explained to Zhang Yu, "Don't reveal our plan to use the World-Piercing Cone for now. We don't want any unnecessary complications."

Hearing Greenwood's reply, Divine Monarch Tranquility frowned. "Greenwood, the principals are currently in a crucial meeting discussing major matters. This isn't the time to act rashly and provoke conflict. Avoid unnecessary losses."

Divine Monarch Greenwood smiled faintly. "Don't worry, Tranquility. I'll be back soon. Nothing will happen."

If Divine Monarchs Cloud Haven, Azure Void, or Magnetic Pole — known for their strong personalities and independent streaks — had spoken this way, Divine Monarch Tranquility wouldn't have been surprised. He would have simply continued trying to dissuade them.

But hearing this from Divine Monarch Greenwood, who was usually conscientious, responsible, and receptive to advice, Divine Monarch Tranquility couldn't help but frown. "Greenwood, the greater good comes first. Stop being stubborn and return immediately."

Hearing Divine Monarch Tranquility's warning, Divine Monarch Greenwood's expression immediately turned cold. He replied flatly, "Tranquility, I know what I'm doing. I don't need your interference."

Divine Monarch Tranquility retorted angrily, "Interference? What 'knowing what you're doing'? Do you even understand your own limitations? If the enemy's Soul Transformation experts mobilize en masse and trap you in their formation, who do you think will have to rescue you?"

"Will you cover the expenses and losses incurred during such a rescue?"

Before Divine Monarch Tranquility could finish his tirade, he realized Divine Monarch Greenwood had abruptly ended the call.

"Hm?"

Staring at the disconnected line, Divine Monarch Tranquility was initially stunned, then erupted in fury.

How long had it been since someone had hung up on him like that? Especially someone like Divine Monarch Greenwood, whom Tranquility considered far weaker than himself.

"Greenwood! If it weren't for the Great Upheaval and Magnetic Pole's assistance, you wouldn't even qualify to ascend to Soul Transformation and join our ranks!"

Hierarchy, ranking, and stratification permeated every aspect of Kunxu society. Even among Soul Transformation experts, there were clear distinctions in strength and status.

In Divine Monarch Tranquility's assessment, among the five Soul Transformation experts at Myriad Laws University, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole ranked first.

He and Divine Monarch Cloud Haven currently ranked second, both being Soul Transformation experts among the top two in Myriad Laws.

Although Azure Void had originally been the strongest Nascent Soul cultivator, his late breakthrough to Soul Transformation and the university's lack of resource allocation placed him fourth.

Greenwood, on the other hand, was the last-ranked, barely scraping by.

As the weakest Soul Transformation expert in Myriad Laws, Divine Monarch Greenwood should, in Tranquility's view, listen to their orders and follow their arrangements. How dare he act independently?

Divine Monarch Tranquility immediately contacted Divine Monarch Cloud Haven.

"Cloud Haven, have you heard about Greenwood's actions? We can't let him run wild and disrupt the battle, causing unnecessary losses for the university."

Divine Monarch Cloud Haven was deeply surprised by this news. As Greenwood's former superior, he believed he understood the man's character well.

"Greenwood isn't the type to act rashly."

He immediately contacted Greenwood: "Old Gao, return immediately. Do you hear me?"

"Gao Chongguang, acknowledge this message immediately."

As Divine Monarch Greenwood remained unresponsive, Divine Monarch Cloud Haven's expression darkened slightly.

Moments later, two streams of divine light shot into the sky, pursuing Divine Monarch Greenwood with relentless speed, determined to intercept him.

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Greenwood pierced through the atmosphere like a shooting star, unleashing massive shockwaves as he instantly arrived above an enemy fortress.

"So fast!" Zhang Yu exclaimed inwardly, startled by the incredible speed. He felt himself being propelled by Divine Monarch Greenwood's Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, making him fly at an unparalleled velocity.

Divine Monarch Greenwood's voice echoed in Zhang Yu's mind: "Today, I'll teach you a crucial lesson: the first rule of the battlefield is to run fast."

"Our Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power embodies the mysteries of celestial motion. The movement of stars represents the ultimate speed in the world."

"Now that you've broken through to the Nascent Soul stage, you'll be able to comprehend this principle once you cultivate the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to level 40."

"It's a pity your generation can no longer see the myriad constellations. Understanding this would be much easier if you could."

Simultaneously, the enemy forces, having detected Divine Monarch Greenwood's approach, had already prepared their defenses.

A divine light shot skyward, radiating the oppressive aura of a Soul Transformation expert.

The Soul Transformation expert from the Righteous Qi Alliance was Divine Monarch Treasure Flow, formerly a Nascent Soul True Monarch and son of a Soul Transformation Expert from the Finance Department of Netherworld University. After the Great Upheaval, he joined the Kunlun Society's rebellion and achieved his Soul Transformation breakthrough.

During his time at Netherworld University, Divine Monarch Treasure Flow was renowned as a prodigious investor, hailed as a prodigy whose words carried the weight of law. Whenever he declared, "Dad, I want this," he invariably secured an exceptionally profitable investment.

Yet even this financial genius, a Heavenly Chosen with a near-perfect investment success rate since his debut, suffered a devastating loss due to the sect's oppressive tactics.

To this day, Divine Monarch Treasure Flow vividly recalled the moment when an old dog sent by a sect disciple forcibly acquired his prized assets.

That day, he truly grasped the sect's systematic suppression and persecution of lower-tier geniuses like himself.

This realization became one of the key reasons he later followed his father and the Kunlun Society in their defection.

"Kunxu offers no investment freedom, no financial freedom whatsoever."

To establish a truly free world, Divine Monarch Treasure Flow followed the Righteous Qi Alliance into battle. With the fall of the fifth and fourth layers, his wealth had swelled more than tenfold, and his cultivation had advanced significantly.

He now served as a pillar of strength on the front lines, resisting the Ten Great Universities.

When he first learned of the Soul Transformation expert's approach, Divine Monarch Treasure Flow's expression turned solemn, and he prepared for battle, immediately sending distress signals to over a dozen other Soul Transformation experts.

But when he discovered that the attacker was Divine Monarch Greenwood of Myriad Laws University, he immediately breathed a sigh of relief.

"I thought it was someone important... Turns out it's just a Civil Engineering Department peasant?"

Although the Righteous Qi Alliance, under the Immortal's disciple Fu Xiantian's orders, forbade discrimination based on specialization or race, for an old financier like Divine Monarch Treasure Flow, looking down on and discriminating against the Civil Engineering Department was practically ingrained in his bones.

"Hmph, if this were a few years ago, Greenwood... they'd have to wait in line just to give me money."

Moreover, Divine Monarch Greenwood's strength was clearly far inferior to his own. He was merely someone who had advanced to Soul Transformation thanks to Magnetic Pole's support.

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Treasure Flow had received messages from other Divine Monarchs of the Righteous Qi Alliance. He immediately replied, "Don't worry, everyone. I alone am sufficient to deal with this mere Greenwood."

As he spoke, he deliberately activated the Dark Spirit Realm's livestream, intending to thoroughly humiliate the enemy Soul Transformation expert while simultaneously accumulating Qi Luck for himself.

Just as Divine Monarch Treasure Flow was executing his rapid series of maneuvers, Divine Monarch Greenwood descended, enveloped in layers of azure divine light.

With a low shout, Greenwood unleashed a terrifying Earthly Fiend Gravity centered on his body, causing the ground to tremble violently and nearby mountains to collapse in layers.

Yet the fortress, protected by layers of Spatial Barriers, remained unscathed, as if existing in a separate dimension, completely unaffected by the earthquake and collapsing mountains.

Divine Monarch Greenwood glanced at the World-Piercing Cone in his hand and asked, "Zhang Yu, can you break through?"

The World-Piercing Cone vibrated slightly. Zhang Yu replied, "No problem."

"Good," Greenwood said. "Then today, master and disciple will break through this formation together."

At that moment, Divine Monarch Treasure Flow's voice boomed from the distance: "Greenwood, as long as I'm here, I won't allow Myriad Laws University to run rampant!"

With that, Divine Monarch Treasure Flow's entire body erupted in brilliant light as over a hundred magical artifacts soared into the sky, unleashing a dazzling array of colors and explosive force that converged upon Divine Monarch Greenwood.

After the plunder of the fourth and fifth layers, particularly targeting the assets left behind by the Soul Transformation experts of various sects, Divine Monarch Treasure Flow's wealth had skyrocketed, and the number of magical artifacts at his disposal far exceeded his previous arsenal.

This casual probe alone unleashed a cataclysmic display, akin to shifting mountains and scorching seas.

Faced with Divine Monarch Treasure Flow's assault, Divine Monarch Greenwood remained silent, merely summoning a World-Piercing Cone amidst the enemy's astonished gaze.

"This is..." Divine Monarch Treasure Flow's eyes narrowed, instantly recognizing it. "The magical artifact from Magnetic Pole?"

In the next instant, a flash of green light erupted as Divine Monarch Greenwood merged with the World-Piercing Cone, transforming into a blazing comet that pierced through the layers of attacks with blinding speed. He hurtled toward the Righteous Qi Alliance's fortress.

With a thunderous crack, space shattered like glass, revealing the comet-like figure of Divine Monarch Greenwood tearing through the Spatial Lockdown. Earthly Fiend Gravity surged violently, ripping the entire fortress to shreds.

"Greenwood!" Divine Monarch Treasure Flow roared in fury as vast assets evaporated instantly. He unleashed a barrage of attacks, but Greenwood effortlessly deflected them all.

Amidst the clash of power, Treasure Flow sensed that most of his strikes were being deflected by Earthly Fiend Gravity. Yet a small portion of his attacks vanished abruptly, their energy dissipated into unknown realms.

Treasure Flow's gaze sharpened as he instantly recognized the World-Piercing Cone's effect. His fury was immediately replaced by avarice.

"Such a treasure would be wasted in Greenwood's hands!"

Seeing Divine Monarch Greenwood turn to retreat, Treasure Flow immediately gave chase, determined to capture him and seize the magical artifact.

Greenwood showed no inclination to prolong the battle, displaying no desire to continue fighting Treasure Flow.

The two figures raced across the battlefield, their passage leaving behind a trail of shattered skies and crumbling earth.

Hours later, the Spirit Realm was flooded with news reports.

On this day, Divine Monarch Greenwood, wielding the World-Piercing Cone, charged straight into the enemy's formation. Single-handedly breaching seven strongholds shielded by Spatial Barriers, he evaded pursuit by four Soul Transformation experts before finally returning safely under the cover of Divine Monarchs Cloud Haven, Tranquility, and others.

The Spirit Realm erupted in chaos, and every school trembled.
