# Chapter 473: The Gathering Storm

Deep within the Spirit Realm, True Monarch Magnetic Pole lightly flicked her fingertip, skimming through rows of incantations and streams of information.

Before her stood the towering Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda, radiating boundless pressure that completely suppressed the surrounding Spirit Realm environment.

Since using the pagoda to seal the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact and isolate its artifact spirit, True Monarch Magnetic Pole had gradually noticed a slight delay in her magical artifact's response time.

In recent days, she had been meticulously repairing the pagoda, thoroughly purging the lingering influence of the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact.

"Such a potent Dual Cultivation poison," she mused inwardly. "No wonder even a Soul Transformation Yin Artifact could be bewitched and its mind corrupted by this thing."

"A brief exposure was enough to so greatly affect the artifact spirit?"

"To create something like this... there must be a Soul Transformation Old Monster lurking behind the Dual Rest Cult."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole was grateful for her decisive action that day. Upon sensing the abnormality of the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact, she had immediately deployed the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda to seal it, severing the artifact spirit's connection to the outside world.

"Since isolating the artifact spirit, I've repeatedly forbidden any communication with it. Even the most reckless individuals shouldn't be able to breach my seal. And those capable of breaching my seal wouldn't be foolish enough to risk madness by tampering with this thing."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole emerged from her seclusion to find a stack of messages awaiting her.

She knew there couldn't be any urgent matters; otherwise, the safeguards she had set would have automatically interrupted her retreat.

However, when she saw the message from True Monarch Celestial Seal, she paused slightly.

"The Soul Transformation Yin Artifact has activated again. Has the level of Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power increased again?"

Instead of immediately replying to Celestial Seal or checking on Zhang Yu, Magnetic Pole went to the laboratory to inspect the Yin Artifact.

After confirming that the artifact spirit hadn't breached its containment and its intelligence remained suppressed, Magnetic Pole nodded slightly and turned back to Celestial Seal's message.

"Zhang Yu... could he possess a Dual Cultivation Sacred Body?"

"Does he meet a specific criterion set by Divine Monarch Jade Nectar within the Yin Artifact?"

Magnetic Pole felt the evidence was still insufficient, and further testing and experimentation were needed.

As she reviewed the recent experimental data, True Monarch Cloud Haven sent a message: "You've emerged from seclusion?"

True Monarch Cloud Haven: "I've reviewed Celestial Seal's report. The university leadership is very pleased."

True Monarch Cloud Haven: "Especially at the recent conference, Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations specifically praised your project team. He has high expectations for you."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole, however, showed no excitement. Instead, her brow furrowed slightly as she thought, "That blabbermouth Celestial Seal... bragging about the slightest progress."

She checked the Spirit Realm Network and found that True Monarch Celestial Seal had already posted numerous updates on his personal social media platform.

"Major breakthrough in Dual Cultivation research! Pioneering a first for Myriad Laws University! No one understands Yin Artifacts better than me! A market-disrupting product will be launched within a year!"

"Damn it..." True Monarch Magnetic Pole grew increasingly irritated as she scrolled. "Is this guy here to scam people or to actually do research? Announcing all this so early... If something goes wrong, won't it jeopardize my future Soul Transformation assessment?"

But the news had already spread. True Monarch Magnetic Pole knew it was too late to stop it now.

She immediately wanted to check on Zhang Yu's progress, only to discover he had gone to Heavenly Sword University for a competition.

"What's the point of some stupid Civil Engineering Competition? Is that more important than our experiments?"

Shaking her head, True Monarch Magnetic Pole turned back to the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact beside her, resolving to continue studying the bionic.

As True Monarch Celestial Seal actively spread the word, and with the encouragement of some leaders at Myriad Laws University, news of the laboratory gradually leaked beyond the campus.

This wasn't a widespread, headline-grabbing story, but rather a development that caught the attention of industry professionals and related parties in niche circles.

Such was the case at Joyful Union University.

When Ping Han's consciousness returned, he felt a delicate, tender hand gently stroking his body.

"I..."

In an instant, he realized he no longer possessed his original body. He now existed as an artifact spirit within a Yin Artifact, a Soul Cultivator's tool. Someone was touching the Yin Artifact.

"Are you Ping Han? From Myriad Laws University?"

Ping Han froze momentarily. When he recognized the voice as Divine Monarch Jade Nectar, he jolted upright, stammering, "Y-yes... that's me."

The female voice asked, "Do you know Zhang Yu?"

Ping Han's heart skipped a beat. Zhang Yu's image flashed in his mind, and a surge of anger welled up within him.

"Zhang Yu! If he hadn't stolen my Military Certificate, I might have weathered the Jade Nectar Coin crash and still had a chance to recover."

However, upon realizing that Divine Monarch Jade Nectar had descended before him, Ping Han immediately suppressed his emotions and calmly replied, "I know him."

A finger pierced Ping Han's body, and another male voice asked, "Tell me everything you know about Zhang Yu."

Ping Han's mind raced. After calming himself, he began, "He has decent talent, but his luck is even better. Thanks to Director Gao of the Civil Engineering Department's favor, he rose through the ranks with remarkable speed..."

Through a series of questions and answers, Ping Han meticulously recounted everything he knew about Zhang Yu, holding nothing back.

When Divine Monarch Jade Nectar revealed that Zhang Yu's Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power had achieved consecutive breakthroughs in Yin Artifact experiments, now reaching level 16, Ping Han's mind reeled. A trace of disbelief flickered across his face.

"Damn it! Myriad Laws University possesses such advanced Yin Artifact technology! Why didn't they announce it sooner?!"

"If I'd known this sooner, I wouldn't have stubbornly held onto my Jade Nectar Coins. I wouldn't have gone bankrupt in that market crash!"

A finger traced patterns across Ping Han's skin as a female voice pressed, "Do you think Zhang Yu might have mastered the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering long ago and been concealing his true strength?"

Ping Han trembled as he replied, "Absolutely impossible! He's just lucky. He gained favor from his teachers, received numerous benefits, and that's why his cultivation advanced so rapidly..."

A male voice chuckled, "Could it be that Myriad Laws has actually made a breakthrough in the Dual Cultivation Dao?"

The female voice scoffed, "Breakthrough my ass! They probably stole our technology!"

"My Yin Artifact!" she roared. "They're using it to publish their research and rake in profits?!"

"Not a single penny in patent fees! Do they expect me to congratulate them?"

The male voice calmly stated, "Our Yin Artifact was lost in connection with the Dual Rest Cult. It's not necessarily Myriad Laws' doing."

"Our Yin Artifact disappears, and then they suddenly unveil new technology?" she retorted. "What a convenient coincidence!"

"That old thief Myriad Transformations always puts on a righteous act, spouting nonsense about fairness, impartiality, and anonymous peer review. But who doesn't know he rigs the meetings beforehand? Does he even remember how he climbed to the position of Divine Monarch?"

"Does Myriad Laws really think their Dual Cultivation Dao techniques can crack our Yin Artifacts?"

The male voice chuckled. "Could they be deliberately timing this to make it look like they stole our Yin Artifacts, cracked the technology, and are now trying to cash in?"

"But none of that matters."

"The Immortal Dao relies on evidence, not speculation. Zhang Yu is competing in the Civil Engineering Competition against someone from Heavenly Sword University. That's the perfect opportunity to gauge the true level of his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power."

The female voice snorted coldly. "If it's truly above level 16, that old thief Myriad Transformations must have stolen our Yin Artifacts and given them to Myriad Laws University to crack."

"If there's no significant improvement, it's 99% likely that old Myriad Transformations is running another scam, setting up a scheme to swindle more money."

While industry insiders focused on True Monarch Celestial Seal's announcement of his experimental results, many others who had been closely following Zhang Yu also became aware of the news.

At Netherworld University, Ye Lingxiao excitedly forwarded the message.

"Zhang Yu has made further progress."

"His Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power has skyrocketed from level 10 to 16, and he hasn't even posted about it yet."

"Isn't this exactly the kind of news President Wang needs?"

But Ye Lingxiao had barely sent the message when he received a reply.

Wang Yin: Fuck off!

Wang Yin: Stop sending me this bullshit!

Ye Lingxiao was furious. "You're the one who wanted updates on Zhang Yu's progress! Now that I've sent them, you're pissed?"

"These Kunxu elites are all talk and no action."

Meanwhile, Wang Yin stared at the flood of messages in his Bionic Eye, his frustration boiling over as he cursed Ye Lingxiao.

Then, frowning, he wondered, "Has Myriad Laws University really made a breakthrough in Dual Cultivation and Yin Artifacts?"

In his view, this wasn't just about Zhang Yu's individual progress, but about the shifting power dynamics among the Ten Great Universities.

"No matter how strong Zhang Yu becomes, it's just individual power. It won't change anything."

"But if Myriad Laws University has truly made a breakthrough in this area, and then gets involved in the Dual Cultivation industry, which they've previously avoided..."

Wang Yin seemed to already envision a future where the intensity of the University War would escalate dramatically amidst bloodshed and chaos.

The implications of such a development would extend far beyond a single individual or university, inevitably impacting even Wang Yin's family's business interests.

"What appears to be a minor matter unnoticed by the public could potentially alter the course of the University War."

"The cicada senses the autumn breeze before it arrives. Our family's investment strategies, and even some of Netherworld University's plans, might need adjustments."

With this thought, Wang Yin's consciousness swiftly traversed the Spirit Realm, heading toward Heavenly Sword University's Spirit Realm Network.

"I suspect many experts in related fields will be closely watching Zhang Yu's competition to assess the true value of Myriad Laws University's technological breakthrough."

---

Meanwhile, at Heavenly Sword University, where many eyes were focused, Wen Wuya stared at the information displayed in his Bionic Eye, surprised. "Myriad Laws University? The notorious Dual Cultivation-suppressing institution? How could they suddenly achieve such a significant breakthrough?"

His immediate reaction was: "This has to be a scam."
