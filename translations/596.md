# Chapter 596: Dao Repository

"Yu Zi..."

Watching Zhang Yu being "rescued" by his seniors, her gaze followed his receding figure, a fleeting hint of melancholy flashed through Bai Zhenzhen's eyes.

But in the next moment, a smile reappeared on her face as she sent Zhang Yu a message: I told you not to get too close right now.

Zhang Yu stared at Bai Zhenzhen, pushed back by the chaotic qi currents, and couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness for the girl.

He messaged back: I'm not afraid.

Bai Zhenzhen: You're not afraid, but I am! What if you get cut or killed?

Bai Zhenzhen: Wouldn't that be a total waste of money? All those perfectly good Spirit Coins going to someone else?

Bai Zhenzhen: Do you have any sense of economics? Why are you acting so impulsively like a Junior College Student?

Zhang Yu: A-Zhen, just wait. Someday I'll have so much money I can hug you all day and it won't matter.

Bai Zhenzhen: Who wants you hugging me all day? What about work?

As their lightning-fast exchange unfolded over the Spirit Realm Network, a voice from the real world snapped Zhang Yu back to attention.

"Junior Brother, are you alright?"

"Did that woman hurt you? Should we make her pay for medical expenses?"

While Ye Xingli spoke, she had already skillfully activated her camera, ready to document any evidence of injury on Zhang Yu's body.

Zhang Yu explained helplessly, "It's alright, Senior Sister. Bai Zhenzhen and I are good friends. She didn't mean to hurt me."

Seeing the Heavenly Sword and Myriad Laws students still facing off against each other, he quickly sent a message to the school team group chat: "Thanks for the help, everyone."

"But Bai Zhenzhen didn't fight me..."

"She's my best friend. She just cultivates the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao and sometimes can't control her emotions or sword qi..."

In the fastest, most concise words possible, Zhang Yu explained the general situation between himself and Bai Zhenzhen.

As the misunderstanding cleared, the Myriad Laws and Heavenly Sword factions relaxed their stances. After exchanging brief greetings, they retreated to their respective camps.

On the way back, Yan Qianji's eyes flashed with shock as he glanced at Zhang Yu, thinking to himself, "I'd only heard that this kid was mixed up with Wen Wuya from Heavenly Sword."

"He's even been chosen by the Soul Transformation Bionic..."

"And in this situation, he still dared to touch Bai Zhenzhen, who cultivates the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao?"

"Is he really not afraid of his entire family being killed later?"

Meanwhile, Nine Heavens Liu, who hadn't intervened at all, had been observing Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen closely from beginning to end.

In his eyes, Bai Zhenzhen's risk index soared relentlessly, approaching the level of a bottomless Spirit Coin sinkhole. No amount of money would be enough to burn on her.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu, who had deliberately approached Bai Zhenzhen, saw his potential rapidly decline in Nine Heavens Liu's eyes.

"Approaching Bai Zhenzhen will mean an additional annual expenditure of at least a hundred Spirit Coins for insurance premiums, medical expenses, magical artifact and Bionic maintenance, and various compensation claims."

"He really has too much money and nowhere to spend it."

Nine Heavens Liu shook his head and immediately sent a message to the group chat: "Zhang Yu, during the Ten Greats League, you are forbidden from approaching Bai Zhenzhen again."

Nine Heavens Liu: "The League isn't just about you."

Nine Heavens Liu: "Any injuries you sustain or any extra Spirit Coin expenditures will affect our entire team's performance."

Nine Heavens Liu: "Do you understand?"

Though annoyed by Nine Heavens Liu's tone, Zhang Yu knew he had a point and replied directly: "I'll maintain a safe distance from Bai Zhenzhen."

Zhang Yu: "Everyone, rest assured. I just wanted to experience the effects of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao firsthand today."

Zhang Yu: "There won't be any unnecessary losses in the upcoming matches."

Observing Zhang Yu's response, Dao Qiankun sensed the hidden meaning behind the words and thought to himself: "This kid Zhang Yu... he doesn't plan to cut ties with Bai Zhenzhen completely, does he?"

"Does this mean he'll continue contacting Bai Zhenzhen even after the Ten Greats League ends?"

Clearly, many in the alumni group understood Zhang Yu's implication.

Nine Heavens Liu paid it no mind. After the league, Zhang Yu could do as he pleased; it wasn't his concern.

Ye Xingli, however, unconsciously frowned, unsure how to advise her Junior Brother.

Dao Qiankun's eyes flickered with thoughtful contemplation. "Does Kunxu still harbor such people?"

But soon, this brief interlude was forgotten as the group's messages continued to flood in, burying it beneath a barrage of updates.

True Monarch Tranquility: The Ten Greats League officially begins tomorrow.

True Monarch Tranquility: The first event is a team competition, involving 100 students from the ten participating universities.

True Monarch Tranquility: Specific competition details haven't been announced yet, but teamwork will undoubtedly be crucial.

Zhang Yu knew that the competition events for this year's Ten Greats League were like college entrance exam questions. To prevent schools from preparing targeted strategies, only vague requirements were revealed in advance, leaving the exact details undisclosed.

True Monarch Tranquility then proceeded to assign team member roles in the group chat.

When he reached Zhang Yu, he reiterated, "You're responsible for the team's flying sword communication support. Your most critical task is maintaining communication support for the entire team..."

Privately, True Monarch Tranquility messaged Zhang Yu: "If multiple contestants need support simultaneously, remember to prioritize Dao Qiankun, Nine Heavens Liu, and Yan Qianji."

Zhang Yu asked: "What if all three need support?"

True Monarch Tranquility replied without hesitation: "Dao Qiankun."

True Monarch Tranquility messaged Zhang Yu: "Zhang Yu, remember this: supporting Dao Qiankun to secure first place is your top priority in this Ten Greats League."

Zhang Yu understood that True Monarch Tranquility was likely giving similar instructions to the other team members as well. After all, Dao Qiankun was Myriad Laws University's primary champion candidate and the student receiving the most resources.

After reiterating each team member's responsibilities, True Monarch Tranquility continued: "Did everyone see the situations with Heavenly Demon, Netherworld, White Bone, and Joyous Union today?"

True Monarch Tranquility: "These four schools have forged a deeper alliance."

True Monarch Tranquility: "To counter this development, the university's leadership has contacted their counterparts at other schools and decided to strengthen our collaborative relationships, establishing multidimensional mutual support systems."

As he spoke, True Monarch Tranquility sent out a group invitation.

True Monarch Tranquility: "This is the joint group for Myriad Laws, Heavenly Sword, Vajra, and Immortal Soldiers Universities. All team members from these four schools will join, enabling seamless communication."

Meanwhile, in the Heavenly Sword University group chat:

Guidance Teacher Jin Quemingxiao: "We've reached an agreement with the leaders of the other three schools to cooperate in the upcoming Ten Greats League, uniting against the alliance of Heavenly Demon, Netherworld, White Bone, and Joyous Union."

Jin Quemingxiao: "We absolutely cannot allow those demons, monsters, and fiends to seize Immortal Sect-level Techniques!"

Inside the laboratory of the Flying Boat, Zhang Yu watched messages flood the group chat of the four universities, thinking to himself, "Four schools against four... what about the remaining two?"

"Has Celestial Monsters University really become the key university now?"

He shook his head. Faced with such a grand scheme, he could only accept it. All he could do was continue focusing on the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, seizing every moment to upgrade this military-grade armor.

The night passed in Zhang Yu's focused artifact refinement.

As dawn broke the next day, the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness, a sun-like magical artifact, blazed brightly, once again illuminating the Kunxu Second Layer.

A hundred competitors from the ten universities gathered above the mountain peak, awaiting the official opening of the Ten Greats League.

Layers of divine light cascaded from the heavens, and streams of Spirit Realm Projections descended, flooding the sky with advertisements.

"This year's Ten Greats League is jointly sponsored by Myriad Paths Group, Heavenly Fiend Group, Netherspring Group, Immortal Sword Group..."

Seeing the names of these giant corporations appear one after another, Zhang Yu realized the opening ceremony had officially begun. Countless viewers across the Kunxu Second Layer were undoubtedly watching the live broadcast.

Even experts from the Kunxu Third to Sixth Layers, and potentially higher, were likely using Divine Travel to access the Spirit Realm Network and watch the cross-dimensional broadcast.

Within University City at Myriad Laws University, Director Gao was working while watching the livestream feed displayed in his Bionic Eye.

Director Gao: Magnetic Pole, are you watching the livestream?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Who knows how long these opening ads will drag on? Who has time for that?

666th Floor of University City

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations smiled faintly and said, "Gentlemen, this year's competition is particularly complex. We must work together wholeheartedly to overcome these challenges."

The two streams of divine light before him trembled slightly in unison, responding, "As it should be."

Kunxu Third Layer.

Inside a graduate student dormitory at Netherworld University.

Wang Yin's spirit was currently traveling through the Spirit Realm, transcending layers to watch the live broadcast from Kunxu Second Layer.

"It's starting," he thought, his heart stirring slightly. "The future transformation of Kunxu will unfold among the strongest Foundation Establishment students in this competition."

"Not just the strongest this year, but possibly the... strongest Foundation Establishment students in the entire history of the Immortal Dao."

Kunxu First Layer.

True Person Starfire's consciousness transcended the layers, his spirit journeying through the Spirit Realm to observe the livestream on Kunxu Second Layer.

Li Xuelian communicated with him through the Spirit Realm, "They're still running commercials."

"Save your data. Come back later," he advised.

True Person Starfire: "Are Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen both participating?"

Li Xuelian chuckled softly. "Yes, can you believe it?"

"In a few more years, they'll probably be ready for their Golden Cores."

True Person Starfire sighed. "So fast... I'm afraid it might not be a good thing."

Within the Dark Spirit Realm, the Joy God, with his thousand hands and feet, gazed calmly at the dozen Evil Gods before him. "Everyone, proceed according to plan," he said. "Prepare to wreak havoc on the Second Layer."

At the Ten Greats League venue, amidst the shifting layers of Spirit Realm Projections, illuminated by true Immortal Light and converging with countless holographic advertisements, the shadow of a book gradually materialized before the crowd.

Simultaneously, ten divine lights of varying forms descended, each radiating either domineering, bloody, holy, or murderous intent — representing the collective will of the ten Soul Transformation-level Principals from the Ten Great Universities — and encircled the book.

These towering pillars of light connected heaven and earth, as if the Principals' wills occupied the entire sky and ground, filling everyone's vision. The sheer force of their combined will seemed to freeze the flow of the Spirit Realm itself.

From within the divine light, the voice of Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution of Myriad Laws University resounded: "By decree of the Heavenly Court and the will of the Immortals, to encourage students across the land to strive forward on the Immortal Dao..."

As Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution spoke, the book's shadow within the ten divine lights erupted with radiance. A jet-black book materialized before the crowd, as if the phantom had solidified into a tangible object.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution declared: "The student who claims first place in this year's Ten Greats League may select any Immortal Sect Technique from this Dao Repository Catalog to study."
