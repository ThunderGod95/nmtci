# Chapter 48: The Top Ten!

At the Magic Power Competition, within the Purple Cloud High School zone.

Dense beads of sweat covered Le Mulan's forehead.

She had just completed her fourth magic power oscillation. The repeatedly ravaged mass of magic power had seemingly transformed into a hazy white mist, floating and sinking indeterminately within her dantian, growing ever more difficult to control.

"Three times. Just three more times and I'll succeed."

...

Song Hailong's breathing grew increasingly heavy.

A vast tide of magic power rose from his dantian like layered white clouds, gradually coalescing into a vortex.

"The last magic power oscillation."

"As expected... I'll be the one to win in the end."

Boom!

Boom!

A sudden roar echoed from the distance.

Song Hailong's expression suddenly changed.

Someone actually beat me to it?

No... that's not it... He quickly realized something, his eyes revealing his astonishment.

"It's two people. Two people were actually faster than me?"

In the distance, Xiong Bufan pressed his palms together. Wisps of white, cloud-like magic power flowed from his hands and gathered into a ball, making it seem as though he had caught a living cloud. However, the cloud quickly began to dissipate, clearly unable to last for long.

But he paid it no mind, instead turning to look in the other direction—where the roar had come from.

"Just a step behind me? Are they from White Dragon High or Purple Cloud High?"

Xiong Bufan stared at the column of white qi that shot skyward, condensed and unwavering like a pillar of cloud, a look of astonishment in his eyes.

"What's he doing? This is just a competition; the goal is speed, and everyone is rushing. Why would he practice the Body-Protecting Astral Qi to such perfection?"

"What a show-off!"

In Songyang High School's competition area.

Zhang Yu spread his palms, and torrents of white energy erupted from them, streaming straight toward the sky like a plume of white signal smoke. In an instant, it drew the attention of more and more people.

After Zhang Yu had hastily forced his way through the Limitless Cloud Hand at top speed—and, as expected, failed to convert any astral qi in the process—he felt that he had already mastered the cultivation technique.

At a mere thought, his qi moved with his will. Currents of magic power completed seven consecutive oscillations, transforming into vigorous astral qi that erupted from his palms and created the spectacle before them.

Witnessing this, Teacher Yan excitedly clenched her fist, then quickly pulled out her phone and began snapping a series of pictures in Zhang Yu's direction.

Teacher Yan thought to herself, _Zhang Yu's talent for magic power control is this astonishing? It seems the previous magic power exam failed to reflect this at all._

Recalling Zhang Yu's recent magic power growth, she mused that it must have been his improvement in this area that had so greatly increased the efficiency of his breathing exercises.

Bai Zhenzhen watched with a moved expression, saying with heartfelt relief, "The boy's grown up."

And after a moment, the results of the third stage of the Magic Power Competition also appeared one after another.

Xiong Bufan of Red Pagoda High School was ranked first.

Zhang Yu of Songyang High School was ranked second.

Song Hailong followed closely behind, becoming third.

Le Mulan of Purple Cloud High School was pushed to fourth place.

And as the third stage gradually concluded, the total Magic Power Competition scores for each student were released one by one.

The students looked at the final rankings, their expressions a mixture of emotions.

First Place, White Dragon High School, Song Hailong, Total Score: 290

Second Place, Purple Cloud High School, Le Mulan, Total Score: 287

Third Place, Red Pagoda High School, Xiong Bufan, Total Score: 285

The three great academies had still swept the top three ranks, pulling far ahead of the other contestants.

At this moment, however, the gazes of most students were not on the top three, but were instead fixed on the person in fourth place.

Fourth Place, Songyang High School, Zhang Yu, Total Score: 273

Although Songyang was also a key high school, its name now appearing in the top ten, surrounded by the three great academies, was strikingly out of place.

It was as if a crack had been forcibly torn open in what was originally an impenetrable dark cloud.

"Fourth place, how much was the prize money again?"

Looking at the final rankings, Zhang Yu couldn't help but grin as he began to wonder about the prize money for fourth place.

He himself was already very satisfied with this ranking.

After all, he was confident he would surpass these rivals in the future.

But in terms of current strength, he was still no match for the prodigies of the three great academies.

He still needed more time to develop.

He had to admit that squeezing into fourth place was thanks to Zhen's divine intervention and the Feather Book's filial piety, though the most important factor was, of course, his own perseverance.

Qian Shen stared intently at Zhang Yu, clearly remembering that Zhang Yu's monthly exam score was 620—a full six points lower than his own.

Yet this 620-scorer was now ranked in the Magic Power Competition alongside the high-level prodigies, the high-caste elites, the ultimate monsters from the three great academies who all scored over 650?!

"It's happening again... It was the same at the art exhibition. This Zhang Yu always magic powerges to perform far beyond the capabilities his score would suggest."

He clutched his head, his eyes wide with disbelief.

"It's as if the six-subject, 700-point evaluation system is no longer sufficient to perfectly express his level of evolution."

"This man..." Qian Shen stared intently at Zhang Yu, a thought that surprised even himself suddenly bubbling up in his mind.

"This man, who cannot be perfectly defined by a score, might just spark another reform of the high school scoring system in the future, making it even more perfect."

Just then, He Dayou glanced at Qian Shen muttering to himself with his head in his hands and thought, _What is this idiot freaking out about now?_

He turned his head, his eyes fixed on Zhang Yu, unable to conceal the turbulent emotions within.

Envy, jealousy... it was impossible not to feel such things, especially when it was all happening to the poor kid he despised most.

At this thought, a hint of regret even surfaced in He Dayou's heart.

_He's just a penniless nobody in the end._

_And it's a good thing... that he's just a penniless nobody._

...

Inside Purple Cloud High School's rest area.

The competition coach looked at Le Mulan, Lian Tianji, and the others, then suddenly spoke.

"What do you think about us recruiting that Zhang Yu?"

The coach had clearly seen Zhang Yu's performance and wanted to bring him into their fold.

Lian Tianji added, "Zhang Yu may not have a Purple Cloud High pedigree, but his performance was excellent. I agree it would be good to bring him over."

This so-called lack of pedigree referred to a pecking order popular within Purple Cloud High.

It generally referred to one's origins from Purple Cloud Nursery, Purple Cloud Kindergarten, Purple Cloud Elementary, and Purple Cloud Middle School.

The more of these Purple Cloud institutions one had attended, from nursery onward, the purer their "pedigree" was considered to be.

Le Mulan asked from the side, "Where did he go to elementary and middle school?"

"I actually asked him about that." Lian Tianji mentioned Zhang Yu's former elementary and middle schools.

An irrepressible look of disgust instantly crossed Le Mulan's face; those two schools reeked of poverty.

Seeing the change in Le Mulan's expression, Lian Tianji knew it was a lost cause.

_Then the next time I see Zhang Yu, it will likely be to face off in the Martial Arts Competition,_ he thought.

Thinking of this, a trace of anticipation actually surfaced in his heart.

...

In front of the restroom.

The moment Zhang Yu stepped out, he was stopped by a man: Han Xingye, the competition coach from White Dragon High School.

"Zhang Yu, come to White Dragon High School." Han Xingye extended a hand toward Zhang Yu. "With your talent, it's a waste to stay at Songyang."

"Although you performed well in this competition, in the future you will only get further and further away from us."

Han Xingye was speaking the truth.

Although the most outstanding students in Songyang City were almost all divided up by the three great schools, over time... there would always be some left behind in other key high schools, or even regular high schools.

Han Xingye had seen a few first-years from... other high schools perform exceptionally in the Magic Power Competition.

But he had never seen a second- or third-year student from... other high schools perform excellently in the Magic Power Competition.

"If you come to White Dragon High, I'll be sure to get you a contract with excellent terms."

Zhang Yu asked suddenly, "If I go to White Dragon High, can I get into the Ten Greats?"

Han Xingye was slightly stunned, seeming not to have expected Zhang Yu to ask such a question, and was caught off guard.

The real answer was naturally no; if Zhang Yu went to White Dragon High School he would merely become an investment project for the school.

Forget the Ten Greats; they wanted to poach Zhang Yu just to keep him out of the remaining first-year competitions. After all, these achievements, which were tied to college entrance exams and university interviews, were vanity projects for the rich. A poor person shouldn't be allowed to take one of the spots.

As for university, he could definitely get into a decent university in the future, but it would absolutely not be one of the Ten Greats.

After all, the conditions at White Dragon High School were definitely better than at Songyang High School, and Zhang Yu could also develop better here.

Only, the spots for the Ten Greats... were never meant for the poor.

Just then, Teacher Yan walked over, blocked Zhang Yu's path, and looked at Han Xingye warily.

"Teacher Han, what are you saying to my student?"

Regardless of whether Zhang Yu was rich or poor, to Teacher Yan, his ability to get a rank was a testament to her teaching success.

Han Xingye gave a helpless smile; they all brought students to competitions every year, so he and this Teacher Yan were acquaintances.

Caught in the act of poaching her student, Han Xingye felt a bit awkward and said to Zhang Yu,

"Whatever the case, it's better than staying at Songyang High... you know what I mean, right?"

Teacher Yan became furious upon hearing this.

_What "you know what I mean"? Don't think that just because you didn't say it, I can't guess the insulting words you have for Songyang High School!_

However, thinking of the gap between her school and White Dragon High, Teacher Yan was genuinely afraid he would say something she couldn't refute, so she cut in.

"That's enough. If you have something to discuss, you can speak with me. Please don't harass our student."

Watching Teacher Yan and Zhang Yu leave, Han Xingye shrugged and thought, _If he's smart, he'll choose our side. Even if he still can't get into the Ten Greats."_

...

"Did you see that?"

"Fourth place! Zhang Yu got fourth place in the overall score! Fourth place, do you hear me?"

"Just say how much money you plan to invest."

Listening to the commotion on Bai Zhenzhen's end, Mo Tianyi said helplessly, "Zhenzhen, you don't have to be so excited. I can see it..."

"Then why aren't you sending the money yet?! Your leader wasn't even this amazing in his first year, was he?"

"Of course the boss has also placed in competitions..."

After some back-and-forth, Mo Tianyi concluded.

"Zhang Yu's results are indeed very outstanding. I admit the money I gave you before was too little. I will discuss the situation with the boss and several other seniors, and do my best to secure more investment for you."

Bai Zhenzhen was already aware of this, and urged, "Remember to approve the money quickly."

Disconnecting the call, Mo Tianyi looked at the screen, at Zhang Yu's fourth-place ranking, and his long-since-cooled chest seemed to grow slightly warm.

"That was beautifully done."

"To break through the suppression of so many rich kids and climb to this rank."

"Unfortunately, it's too late..."

A flicker of helplessness and gloom passed through Mo Tianyi's mind.

_If only this had been two years earlier, I would have chosen you without a doubt._

Meanwhile, Bai Zhenzhen thought, _Placed in a Martial Arts Competition, did he? I'm curious to see just who you are._
