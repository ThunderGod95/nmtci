# Chapter 504: Stay in Civil Engineering or Switch Departments?

True Monarch Cloud Haven sighed helplessly at Director Gao's earnest gaze. He pointed at Director Gao and said, "You know, you're younger than me, yet you live like an old relic."

"Students will eventually leave the nest. Think about yourself for once."

Director Gao chuckled softly. "Principal, Zhang Yu is my most promising disciple. He might even shoulder the future of the Civil Engineering Department. His future gains will be shared with me, so helping him is helping myself."

True Monarch Cloud Haven paused, frowning. "Zhang Yu is your disciple?"

Director Gao nodded. "Indeed. I've decided to recommend him for graduate studies and plan to announce it at the banquet later."

True Monarch Cloud Haven nodded slowly, his expression still puzzled. "Oh."

He quickly sent a message to True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "What are you and Old Gao up to?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Nothing.

True Monarch Cloud Haven: Magnetic Pole, with so many eyes watching today, don't make a fool of us.

Sensing True Monarch Cloud Haven's confusion, Director Gao added, "Principal, rest assured. Zhang Yu's aptitude and character, based on my observations, make him an excellent investment. He's destined to become a key figure in the Civil Engineering Department and will bring significant financial benefits to the school."

"Hmm, hmm," True Monarch Cloud Haven mused inwardly. "Could there be some strategy I'm unaware of?"

Just then, Zhang Yu approached Director Gao, who introduced him to True Monarch Cloud Haven.

Meanwhile, on the other side, Tu Lishan was listening to Shi Huaiyu's report.

Suddenly, his eyebrows shot up. "What did you say?"

Shi Huaiyu repeated, "Zhang Yu ultimately transplanted the Seven Absolutes Bionic..."

Tu Lishan interrupted, "No, I meant the previous part. Which department did Zhang Yu transfer to?"

Shi Huaiyu replied, "The Artifact Refinement Department, Teacher. Didn't you know?"

Tu Lishan paused, glancing at Zhang Yu and Director Gao in the distance. "Zhang Yu's transferring to the Artifact Refinement Department? And joining True Monarch Magnetic Pole's sect?" he thought to himself.

He was about to send a message to Director Gao when he hesitated, remembering another question.

"Could Director Gao already know about this?"

"He and True Monarch Magnetic Pole have been allies for centuries. Could they be collaborating on this scheme?"

On the other end of the line, Director Lin listened to Xiao Yunji's report and snorted coldly. I knew it, he thought grimly. Gao Chongguang could never have cultivated a student like Zhang Yu in just three years on his own. The Artifact Refinement Department must be backing him.

Recalling Ji Yuanshu, whose potential had been prematurely extinguished, Director Lin sighed inwardly. Perhaps we shouldn't have promoted Ji Yuanshu so aggressively back then. Acting covertly like Gao Chongguang and Magnetic Pole would have yielded better results.

Though True Monarch Sacred Mountain, the Old Director, had long passed away, his soul now resided in the Spirit Realm. He had projected a manifestation of himself to attend the banquet.

As he listened to Su Yanyang's report on the competition, the Old Director's gaze flickered. Old Gao's move will likely pull the entire Civil Engineering Department toward artifact crafting, solidifying their support for war in the future.

He also recalled the hostility Joyful Union University harbored toward True Monarch Magnetic Pole's Bionic project, as well as the clash between Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations and Divine Monarch Jade Nectar. The Old Director sensed treacherous undercurrents swirling beneath the surface.

"Are they truly trying to drag Myriad Laws into this?"

The Old Director sighed inwardly. "Ah, the tides of great contention... Perhaps retiring early wouldn't be such a bad thing after all."

Just then, the banquet hall's lighting shifted. Except for the area around Director Gao, the rest of the hall dimmed.

All eyes turned to Director Gao and Zhang Yu, who stood beside him.

Director Gao smiled triumphantly and began to speak slowly, "Distinguished teachers and students, today's clear skies mirror our current mood — the sun burns fiercely, and our blood runs hot."

"The Civil Engineering Department's Competition Team has defeated Vajra University, Heavenly Sword University, Immortal Armaments University, and Celestial Monsters University. They have overcome countless obstacles, climbed relentlessly, and finally claimed this year's championship."

"Behind this achievement lie countless Spirit Coins invested and countless hours dedicated. This victory belongs not only to the Competition Team itself but also to the triumph of our university's educational philosophy..."

"And Zhang Yu, as a first-time participant in the Inter-University Competition, made a significant contribution to this victory. He embodied the Righteous Path of Civil Engineering, leading his teammates to a righteous victory over Celestial Monsters University and securing the crucial finals."

"I hope he will continue to strive for excellence, using this achievement as a solid foundation to shine brightly in the Civil Engineering Department in the future..."

The audience reacted with varied expressions. Tu Lishan wore a peculiar look, True Monarch Cloud Haven appeared puzzled, Director Lin's face was filled with disdain, while the Old Director seemed deep in thought.

The students, however, gazed at Zhang Yu with envy, jealousy, and admiration, already regarding him as a role model for the Civil Engineering Department.

In the next moment, Director Gao clasped Zhang Yu's hand and announced, "Today, I have another announcement to make."

"Zhang Yu passed the Military Civil Engineering Certificate in his third year and led his team to victory in the Inter-University Competition. Such extraordinary achievements have been unseen in the Civil Engineering Department for many years."

"Therefore, I have decided to nominate Zhang Yu for direct admission to the Civil Engineering Department's graduate program. Furthermore, I will personally serve as his advisor, dedicating all my efforts to nurturing him into a pillar of talent who will benefit both the Civil Engineering Department and the Myriad Laws..."

Director Gao's words immediately sparked a wave of commotion in the hall.

Most of the students present merely envied Zhang Yu's current glory, jealous of the Director's unwavering support.

But the teachers understood the true weight of Director Gao's words.

Such wholehearted support for a personal disciple transcended ordinary loans, blood ties, or contractual obligations.

The Old Director thought to himself, "He's practically raising Zhang Yu as his own son... No, this attitude goes even beyond that. No wonder. If I had a student like this, a guaranteed return on investment, I'd pour more resources into him than even my own descendants."

"But... wasn't Zhang Yu planning to transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department and join the Magnetic Pole Sect?"

The Old Director's eyes narrowed slightly as he mused, "Could there be a conflict brewing between the two sides? Seeing Zhang Yu's potential, are they both trying to snatch him?"

For a cultivator of the Old Director's age, such student-snatching incidents were rare but certainly not unheard of.

After all, students were somewhat like stocks: the more you invested in high-quality students, the greater the returns. They were excellent investment assets.

However, unlike stocks, students couldn't be invested in by many people. Investment opportunities were limited, naturally leading to fierce competition.

In the Old Director's eyes, Zhang Yu was like a promising startup company, and securing funding required a fierce battle.

Yet, this was the first time he'd witnessed the Civil Engineering Department and the Artifact Refinement Department vying for a student.

Previously, such competition for top students typically occurred among the elite departments like Finance, Artifact Refinement, and Daoist Arts, where teachers scrambled to recruit wealthy students.

Meanwhile, Tu Lishan's eyes widened in shock. He thought to himself, "What's going on? Could Director Gao really... not know?"

Ye Xingli swallowed hard, instinctively glancing at True Monarch Magnetic Pole in the distance. "What will Teacher do? Will a conflict erupt right here?"

"Oh?" Director Lin's lips curled into a sudden smile. "I'm not sure what's happening, but it looks like we're in for quite a show."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu felt Director Gao's gaze upon him. He opened his mouth, but found himself struggling to breathe.

Could he refuse?

Feeling the sincerity in Director Gao's eyes and recalling the care the director had shown him over the past three years, Zhang Yu found it impossible to voice a rejection.

But could he accept?

The awkward reality that Civil Engineering students couldn't enter the Sect made it clear that pursuing a graduate degree in Civil Engineering was out of the question. In fact, even an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering might be seen as a black mark by the Sect.

Without Sect membership, Zhang Yu would inevitably succumb to the backlash of the ritual and die.

At that point, no matter how much Director Gao had invested in him, it would all come to nothing.

With this realization, Zhang Yu urgently messaged True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Teacher?

Zhang Yu: What should I do?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Just stall for time or brush it off.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, Why is True Monarch Magnetic Pole so calm? What plan does she have?

Meanwhile, Director Gao, noticing Zhang Yu's delayed response, asked, "Zhang Yu?"

Zhang Yu swallowed hard and slowly replied, "Over the past three years in the Civil Engineering Department, I've learned a great deal."

"The hazardous environment of construction sites has tempered my physique, while the demanding work has honed my Cultivation Art. My comprehensive knowledge of construction has significantly enhanced my earning potential."

"Moreover, the support from my teachers and the various conveniences you, Director Gao, provided have made these three years the period of my most rapid growth in life..."

Just then, a shimmering light flickered within the Spirit Realm, and projections of countless Spirit Coins flooded every corner of the hall.

A projection composed entirely of Spirit Coins slowly strode from the depths of the Spirit Realm and came to a stop before Zhang Yu.

"My apologies for the interruption."

"I am True Monarch Chain Nexus from the Finance Department."

"Zhang Yu, would you be interested in joining the Finance Department? Becoming my disciple?"

The audience watched in astonishment.

"True Monarch Chain Nexus?" Tu Lishan mused inwardly. "Isn't he a disciple of Divine Monarch Golden Citadel?"

Divine Monarch Golden Citadel was one of the three Divine Monarchs of Myriad Laws University, a graduate of the Finance Department with immense authority over the university's budget and investment allocations.

Director Lin's expression shifted slightly. "The Finance Department wants to recruit Zhang Yu? Why wasn't I informed?"

Unlike the teachers, whose minds were racing with complex thoughts, the students watching this scene had only one thought:

Say yes!

Civil Engineering or Finance? Was there even a choice? It was like choosing between eating shit or eating candy.

Gongshu Jin, Ma Xuan, Feng Tingting, and many other students in the audience wished they could take Zhang Yu's place and eagerly accept the Finance Department's offer.

But when True Monarch Chain Nexus asked, Zhang Yu replied with unwavering resolve, "I'm sorry, but I have no interest in the Finance Department."

True Monarch Chain Nexus, clearly surprised by Zhang Yu's blunt refusal, paused before adding, "Don't worry. No matter how much you owe in breach of contract fees or what agreements you've signed, if you join the Finance Department, I'll cover everything."

"Your graduate school admission is guaranteed, and I'll be your mentor."
