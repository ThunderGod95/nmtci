# Chapter 581: A Staggering Block

As countless red warning banners suddenly refreshed in the air, forming an impenetrable barrier before the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, Yu Xinghan tensed immediately.

Only when Zhang Yu gently patted his shoulder did Yu Xinghan relax slightly, joining Zhang Yu in gazing at the projection of True Person Rising Sun ahead.

Meanwhile, True Person Rising Sun breathed a sigh of relief as he watched the level 40 Heavenly Sun Radiance God slowly halt, refraining from crushing his Spirit Realm Projection.

"It seems my gamble paid off. True Monarch Magnetic Pole is currently riding a wave of popularity, her prestige soaring as she grows ever more dazzling."

"But at this critical moment, she's also become increasingly cautious, unwilling to take any drastic actions."

As for incurring True Monarch Magnetic Pole's resentment... True Person Rising Sun had already dismissed such concerns.

The competition within the Patrol Team was fierce, and he was no longer a student eligible for certification exams.

True Person Rising Sun knew that if he failed to seize this opportunity, he might remain stuck in the Golden Core Realm for the rest of his life.

"Only by continuing to advance and climb the ranks can I obtain the Nascent Soul Certificate and break through my cultivation realm..."

Thinking of the person who had contacted him before this operation began, True Person Rising Sun's resolve deepened, and his gaze toward Zhang Yu unconsciously grew more resolute.

Zhang Yu said, "True Person Rising Sun, I didn't expect to see you again so soon. Do you know whose vehicle this is?"

True Person Rising Sun replied coldly, "I only know that Yu Xinghan, the one scheduled to be tested for the Dual Rest Virus today, is right beside you. Please have him come with me."

Zhang Yu asked, "True Person Rising Sun, does today's testing for the Dual Rest Virus include personnel not currently on the construction site?"

A holographic projection flashed before True Person Rising Sun's eyes, displaying a list of names.

Pointing to the large, red-highlighted characters "Yu Xinghan" on the list, he said coldly, "This is the team's scheduled testing roster for today. Whether they're on the construction site or not, everyone must be tested."

As Zhang Yu scanned the names on the list, he thought to himself, "Just as I suspected... they've been targeting Yu Xinghan all along."

Sensing Zhang Yu's piercing gaze, True Person Rising Sun met his stare without flinching. Their eyes locked in a silent clash, as if sparks were flying between them in the air.

True Person Rising Sun, despite possessing the Golden Core Realm, was far outmatched by Zhang Yu's current power.

Zhang Yu, cradled in the palm of the Level 40 Heavenly Sun Radiance God, was wreathed in celestial flames that soared skyward. Behind him, the Great Sun seemed to rise, his aura now far surpassing True Person Rising Sun's.

Looking down at True Person Rising Sun from his lofty position, Zhang Yu said calmly, "This is my Master, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's, personal vehicle."

True Person Rising Sun replied solemnly, "Student Yu, this is a routine matter. I hope you and True Monarch Magnetic Pole can understand and support our procedures. If True Monarch Magnetic Pole has any grievances, I will personally visit to offer my apologies at a later date."

Zhang Yu remained silent, turning to Yu Xinghan and whispering, "Xinghan, just endure it for a while after you go in, and you'll be out soon."

"When you get back, the company manager position will be waiting for you."

Yu Xinghan nodded, took a deep breath, and descended from the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, walking toward True Person Rising Sun's location.

Throughout the entire exchange, True Person Rising Sun's projection remained focused on the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's movements. In his perception, the colossal entity, radiating earth-shattering Magic Power fluctuations, seemed to be watching his projection as well.

Knowing that the Heavenly Sun Radiance God possessed the so-called Heavenly Sun Resonance, allowing it to maintain sensory synchronization across the Spirit Realm, True Person Rising Sun felt as if a pair of eyes were watching him through the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, even piercing through his projection to gaze directly upon his true form, hidden far beyond the mountains.

"True Monarch Magnetic Pole..." True Person Rising Sun's heart sank. "Is she watching me?"

However, the calamity he feared never materialized. Until he took Yu Xinghan away, True Monarch Magnetic Pole made no move against him, not even uttering a single word.

Yet shortly after he left with Yu Xinghan, a communication descended from the heavens, pressing against True Person Rising Sun's forehead and demanding immediate connection.

Seeing the name on the other end of the line, True Person Rising Sun slowly exhaled and answered, "Division Chief..."

The voice on the other end was icy cold. "Intercepting True Monarch Magnetic Pole's military-grade puppet at the entrance to University City — do you realize how many eyes were watching? Are you planning to rebel against a Nascent Soul cultivator?"

Just moments earlier, as True Person Rising Sun intercepted the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's gaze pierced through the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, her consciousness already traversing the Spirit Realm to contact Division Chief True Monarch Morningstar of the Patrol Team's Fourth Division.

The two stood face-to-face in the Spirit Realm, their ensuing conversation unfolding with deceptive speed. What appeared to be a mere instant in the outside world contained a vast exchange of information.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole casually remarked, "True Monarch Morningstar, I have a question for you."

Though human, True Monarch Morningstar's Spirit Realm Projection manifested as a dragon-tiger hybrid, exuding both imposing majesty and solemn righteousness.

Hearing True Monarch Magnetic Pole's inquiry, True Monarch Morningstar showed no surprise, as if he had anticipated it. He replied, "Since the economic crisis and the Demonic Sect's attack on the school, the school administration has become extremely vigilant about the Demonic Sect's infiltration of the campus."

"Routine inspections are now conducted throughout the school at regular intervals."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded. "I didn't contact you for any special favors or preferential treatment. Zhang Yu is my disciple, after all. If something were to happen to him, I'd want to be informed, wouldn't I?"

True Monarch Morningstar smiled. "True Monarch Magnetic Pole, the Dual Rest Virus detection systems are functioning normally across all construction sites, not just one or two. This isn't targeting your disciple."

"Not targeting him?" True Monarch Magnetic Pole hissed, and the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda behind her erupted in blinding light, seemingly sealing off the entire area.

"Your subordinates blocked my Heavenly Sun Radiance God!"

"They plastered warning projections all over University City's entrance! Anyone would think he was trying to fight above his rank, a Golden Core cultivator daring to challenge my Nascent Soul realm?!"

True Monarch Morningstar paused, then quickly replied, "I wasn't informed of this incident. They didn't report it to me."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole continued slowly, "Morningstar, you should be aware of my current situation."

True Monarch Morningstar nodded slightly, his gaze drawn to the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda behind her. A flicker of alarm crossed his mind.

To his perception, the pagoda seemed to be on the verge of breaking through to the Soul Transformation realm. At times, it felt as if it had already crossed the threshold, while at others, it seemed to hover just below it. Even he couldn't fully grasp its true depth.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole continued, "As for Zhang Yu, he is a crucial outcome of the Soul Transformation Bionic Project, a matter personally overseen by Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations."

"To ensure my disciple's free access to University City, I swore a military oath before Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations, vowing to protect his safety."

"My escorting him and his subordinates today stems from this very reason."

True Monarch Morningstar quickly interjected, "I understand the situation perfectly. We all do..."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole pressed on, "It's not that we're preventing your investigation, but rather urging you to manage the impact. The Demonic Sect is no trivial matter, but the university must prioritize economic and Immortal Dao development. We can't afford to lose sight of the bigger picture, wouldn't you agree?"

True Monarch Morningstar thought to himself, "He's distancing himself from the incident while simultaneously leveraging Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations and the project to protect his disciple. Truly befitting someone on the verge of Soul Transformation — every word and action meticulously detached from karmic consequences."

True Monarch Morningstar hastily assured, "We will strictly adhere to university regulations and remain mindful of the impact."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole's figure slowly faded, leaving only a parting remark: "Good. Just remember, don't let yourselves be manipulated by those with ulterior motives who seek to undermine the university's stability."

True Monarch Morningstar's mind echoed with True Monarch Magnetic Pole's warning about "those with ulterior motives." Immediately after ending the call, he contacted True Person Rising Sun and summoned him to the Spirit Realm.

True Person Rising Sun, hearing his superior's reprimand, quickly explained, "Division Chief, I was just about to report this matter to you."

True Monarch Morningstar retorted coldly, "Report? You only report after you've already intercepted him?"

True Person Rising Sun clarified, "There was no time. When we located the target, they were only 30 kilometers from Myriad Laws University."

True Monarch Morningstar snorted. "You intercepted True Monarch Magnetic Pole's military-grade puppet at the entrance to University City. Did you consider the far-reaching consequences of such a dramatic move?"

Though still 30 kilometers away, for them, it was as good as being at the university's doorstep.

True Person Rising Sun countered, "It wasn't exactly a 'dramatic move,' was it?"

True Monarch Morningstar snapped, "True Monarch Magnetic Pole is the head of the Artifact Refinement Department, the principal investigator of a university-level key project, and a candidate for Soul Transformation! Every move she makes is scrutinized by countless eyes!"

"Your actions today will cause fluctuations in stock prices and cryptocurrency values, impact commodity prices, and affect investments both within and outside the university!"

"And do you realize how many external forces are just waiting for an opportunity to attack and smear our university? How they'll exploit this incident to the fullest?"

True Person Rising Sun said, "Precisely for this reason, I had to intercept Zhang Yu. Otherwise, the Dual Rest Virus could spread further, escalating the situation."

True Monarch Morningstar said, "Continue."

True Person Rising Sun said, "Zhang Yu just gave a company-wide pay raise today."

True Monarch Morningstar was slightly surprised. "The entire company? A pay raise?"

True Person Rising Sun nodded. "Moreover, Zhang Yu has been in contact with members of the Dual Rest Cult at the Vocational College."

"He also seems to have received advance notice of our investigation, even taking Yu Xinghan away early. There's definitely something suspicious going on."

True Person Rising Sun projected a series of documents. "These are Yu Xinghan's recent work logs. He's taken numerous days off this month, and his work efficiency has noticeably declined — classic symptoms of the Dual Rest Virus."

"Would a normal person take so many days off?"

"Furthermore, several infected individuals have been discovered at the Civil Engineering Department's construction sites recently, all of whom had varying degrees of contact with Yu Xinghan."

"We strongly suspect that Yu Xinghan is using his position to spread the Dual Rest Virus..."

By this point, True Monarch Morningstar understood that True Person Rising Sun had been monitoring Yu Xinghan for some time.
