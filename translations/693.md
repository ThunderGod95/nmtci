# Chapter 693: Mission Complete

True Monarch Earth Soul snorted coldly as the Monkey Demon charged toward him.

Initially, he had planned to target the weakest link among the four Nascent Souls — the Monkey Demon, the only monsterfolk among them — hoping to suppress it quickly.

However, to his surprise, the Monkey Demon emerged unscathed from his initial strike and retaliated with a ferocious assault.

True Monarch Earth Soul had originally intended to spare the Monkey Demon's life to increase the value of his spoils. But faced with this unexpected resistance, he abandoned his restraint. With a thought, his Nascent Soul surged toward the Monkey Demon once more.

The pitch-black Nascent Soul, forged as if from molten metal, shot forward, unleashing the full power of the Heavenly Demon Reorganization Technique as it slammed into the Monkey Demon.

The Heavenly Demon Reorganization Technique was a daoist art that delved into the structure of matter, studying the internal forces that governed it.

Through this technique, True Monarch Earth Soul could microscopically decompose and reorganize most substances in the world. The more familiar he was with a target material's properties and the more experience he had using the technique on it, the faster and more efficient the decomposition and reorganization process became.

In the past, he had primarily used the Heavenly Demon Reorganization Technique for materials research at Heavenly Demon University, shuttling between laboratories and factories.

As for using it in combat, it was far too costly for True Monarch Earth Soul. With such a money-losing proposition, he had far more cost-effective methods for dealing with his enemies.

It wasn't until the Great Upheaval and the outbreak of war that killing rebels and traitors no longer incurred financial penalties. Only then could True Monarch Earth Soul unleash the full power of the Heavenly Demon Reorganization Technique without restraint.

1... 10... 1000... 10,000!

After slaughtering tens of thousands of people, True Monarch Earth Soul had reached an unprecedented peak in the pulverization and reorganization of flesh and blood. He could even repair shattered bodies after pulverizing them, significantly increasing the value of the corpses.

Now, as True Monarch Earth Soul unleashed his full power, streaks of lightning flashed across the Flying Boat's deck, layer after layer splitting apart with explosive crackles as the air itself seemed to disintegrate.

Had he not deliberately contained the blast, a single strike could have reduced the entire Flying Boat and its cargo of over a hundred thousand frozen goods to ashes.

Under this devastating attack, the Monkey Demon before him was instantly enveloped in lightning, its body erupting in clouds of blood mist before collapsing to the ground with a thud. Its vital energy plummeted rapidly, vanishing completely.

Though the Monkey Demon had fallen to his strike, its formidable physique left a deep impression on True Monarch Earth Soul.

After all, he had estimated that his attack should have shattered the demon's body into countless fragments, not merely left it a bloody mess.

Simultaneously, the remaining three Nascent Soul Cultivators, though a step behind, had finally arrived.

Seeing Qitian instantly annihilated, Night Shift, a burly woman, cursed inwardly, "One-shot kill? Damn it... you can't trust monsterfolk!"

On the other side, 007 sighed inwardly, "Too weak. I should have brought more reinforcements."

In the next instant, True Monarch Earth Soul clashed with 007 and the others. Streaks of lightning flashed as crimson blossoms of blood erupted continuously from their bodies.

True Monarch Earth Soul's Heavenly Demon Reorganization Technique was utterly domineering, especially against the Righteous Qi Alliance. He attacked with reckless abandon, shattering magical artifacts and Bionics alike, while flesh and blood melted like snow at his touch.

No matter the material or substance, it seemed utterly transparent to him, capable of being pulverized in an instant.

Despite the trio's desperate attempts to defend themselves with their unique techniques, they were steadily pushed back, each feeling like a rapidly deteriorating piece of equipment, visibly crumbling under True Monarch Earth Soul's relentless assault.

"Three Rogue Nascent Souls, armed with nothing but scraps, trying to rob me?" True Monarch Earth Soul sneered. "The materials in your magical artifacts and Bionics? I've analyzed them hundreds of thousands of times in my laboratory. Is there a single research paper on them I haven't studied?"

Facing these unlicensed Nascent Souls, True Monarch Earth Soul exuded arrogance. After all, even among cultivators in the Nascent Soul Realm, those who had earned their Nascent Soul Certificates within the past century stood at the top of the cultivation hierarchy.

As for the Ancient Nascent Souls lower on the hierarchy, and even further down... the New Nascent Souls hastily promoted after the war began — True Monarch Earth Soul regarded them with the same disdain as one might view the differences between the Ten Universities, Upper College, and Lower College.

In their first encounters, Nascent Souls often needed only glance at each other's certification dates to gauge their respective depths.

These unlicensed Rogue Nascent Souls, however, occupied the very bottom of the hierarchy, so low that many Nascent Soul Cultivators referred to them as "Pirate Nascent Souls" or "Dark Nascent Souls."

Faced with True Monarch Earth Soul's mocking assault, 007 and his companions couldn't help but feel agitated and resentful. They knew their fighting spirit was being eroded, yet they were powerless to stop it.

"Don't argue with him about the certificate!" 007 warned.

He understood that the more they debated the Nascent Soul Certificate with someone like True Monarch Earth Soul — an elite from the Ten Universities — the more his opponent's fighting spirit would surge. Their own certificate-less breakthroughs left them feeling insecure, undermining their momentum.

Night Shift chimed in, "Strike his weak point! He has a certificate, right? Then the entire ship is his weakness!"

As she spoke, Night Shift unleashed a blast of Gang Qi at a nearby shipping container.

True Monarch Earth Soul's gaze sharpened. His Nascent Soul flickered, instantly intercepting the Gang Qi.

But moments later, 007 and Old Death joined the fray, launching attacks against the surrounding containers. Forced to defend against each strike, True Monarch Earth Soul found himself enduring a relentless barrage from three opponents.

True Monarch Earth Soul looked down on Junior College Students, viewing vocational colleges as mere trash. Yet even trash belonged to the school, was company property, and formed part of the cargo he was transporting.

If anyone dared to harm the "trash," he would protect it with his life, even if that "trash" consisted of Junior College Students he had always despised. He would defend them to the end!

"Not a single Junior College Student will die under my watch!"

Watching the three Rogue Nascent Souls still rampaging through the cargo, True Monarch Earth Soul's eyes blazed with murderous intent. "You three Nascent Scum have truly crossed the line."

His overwhelming killing intent pressed down on his opponents as he pointed a finger skyward. A beam of celestial light instantly descended, forging a connection between heaven, earth, the sun, and himself.

With emergency support from Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness, the Spirit Realm Network reconnected, and a dense array of talismans materialized around True Monarch Earth Soul.

Then, a hazy humanoid figure descended from the heavens, radiating an aura of savage triumph.

After the disappearance of the Righteous Gods, Soul Cultivators had taken over most daily tasks. With the adaptive innovations of Spirit Realm Techniques, skilled Talisman Cultivators began replacing the Righteous Gods, summoned as Spirit Realm Projections to provide various services to cultivators.

Simultaneously, lines of text rapidly scrolled above True Monarch Earth Soul's head, each new line sinking 007 and his companions' hearts deeper into despair.

Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness Diamond Membership Activated!

Great Sun Spirit Realm Connection Activated!

Spirit Realm Speed Increased to 1,000 Scrolls Per Second!

Divine Descent Membership Activated!

Talisman Cultivator Personal Service Activated!

Fully Automated Nascent Soul-Tier Talisman Activated! Combat Database Connection Established! Heavenly Demon Banner Remote Service Activated! Weather Control Service Activated!

Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword Support Activated!

As each paid service activated, True Monarch Earth Soul's aura erupted with overwhelming power.

"He's... he's so rich!" Night Shift exclaimed, watching the spectacle. "How can he be this wealthy? The intelligence reports said his net worth was only five digits at most!"

007's expression turned grave. "The intelligence is outdated. His wealth has clearly skyrocketed during the war..."

Old Death sighed inwardly. This was war, this was the chaotic era — anyone could suddenly amass immense wealth or achieve a breakthrough in combat power.

Staring at the three tense figures before him, True Monarch Earth Soul, his head crowned with titles, said coldly, "Nascent Scum. In my normal state, I could handle about 8 to 10 Rogue Souls."

"But when I'm burning money at full throttle, I can take on over 20 Rogue Souls."

"Using my full power is expensive, so this battle will be swift."

He thought to himself, "I must end this before my budget runs out."

Before True Monarch Earth Soul could finish speaking, electric arcs, divine light, sword light, Gang Qi... clashed violently in the air.

With a single strike, he shattered Night Shift's full-body Bionic, then stomped her to the ground, completely suppressing her.

Wind, rain, thunder, and lightning descended from the heavens, sweeping 007 away like a thunderous calamity and forming a lightning cage that trapped him securely.

Under the Talisman Cultivator's Spirit Realm assault, Old Death convulsed violently, trapped in an endless Illusionary Realm. He began attacking indiscriminately, targeting friend and foe alike, until countless sword shadows pinned him in mid-air.

In an instant, True Monarch Earth Soul had suppressed all three Nascent Souls.

He smiled faintly and addressed the nearby camera, "Heavenly Demon Nascent Souls, safeguarding regional peace and protecting company assets..."

But just as he believed the battle was over, a dark figure suddenly materialized before him, silently delivering a devastating punch to his chest.

*Bang!*

True Monarch Earth Soul was blasted backward, but he retaliated almost instantly.

Yet neither the flashing thunderlight, the crisscrossing sword light, nor the attacks from the Spirit Realm could stop his opponent.

Though the enemy's body was constantly erupting with wounds, spewing blood mist from repeated heavy blows, he moved forward like a silent, unyielding continental plate, bearing down on Earth Soul with unstoppable momentum. Another fist slammed toward him.

Roar!

With a furious roar, the Monkey Demon's muscles bulged as he unleashed his monsterfolk bloodline talent, pushing his strength to its absolute limit.

Bang!

A surprise attack followed by a relentless barrage drove True Monarch Earth Soul beyond the Flying Boat's perimeter.

As he stared at the figure who had ambushed him, Earth Soul's eyes widened in surprise. "The Monkey Demon?"

He gazed coldly at the blood-soaked monsterfolk before him, whose posture remained upright and whose aura soared to the heavens. "To withstand so many of my attacks and still live, your strength is remarkable. You're no Rogue Soul. Are you from Celestial Monsters University?"

At that moment, Divine Monarch Earth Soul realized the truth: "This creature was feigning death all along, waiting to ambush me?"

If his opponent had merely possessed superior strength, True Monarch Earth Soul would have taken him seriously but remained calm.

However, the fact that this powerful foe could also remain grounded, patiently biding his time for a sneak attack, forced True Monarch Earth Soul to grow deeply wary.

Hearing True Monarch Earth Soul's words, Zhang Yu, in his Monkey Demon Incarnation, offered no reply. He silently circulated the Remnant Ox's Self-Sacrifice Heart Sutra at Level 40, accelerating the healing of his physical injuries.

Since breaking through to the Nascent Soul Realm, the Remnant Ox's Self-Sacrifice Heart Sutra, which had been passively circulating within him at all times, had gradually leveled up, reaching its peak state at Level 40.

At Level 40, the Remnant Ox's Self-Sacrifice Heart Sutra's activation of bodily vitality went beyond simple wound healing, accelerating the regeneration of flesh and blood.

Though Zhang Yu appeared bloodied and mangled, as if critically injured, the muscles, bones, and internal organs beneath his skin had already returned to their normal state.

In truth, Zhang Yu had sustained no serious injuries during his battle with True Monarch Earth Soul. Apart from superficial wounds, he had suffered only minor internal damage.

As a cultivator who had barely entered the Nascent Soul Realm less than a month ago, Zhang Yu was acutely aware that his strength was unremarkable within that realm.

His only reliable strengths were the Immortal Sect Technique combined with the near-invincible defense granted by his Immortal Descendant lineage.

"In that case, my strategy is simple and clear."

"Sneak attacks and posturing."

"Using sneak attacks combined with my overwhelming defensive power to control the battlefield."

"Posturing to endlessly inflate the opponent's expectations of the cost of engagement, ultimately forcing them to surrender without a fight."

But Zhang Yu knew that while he could execute this plan, it was best not to directly reveal the powers of Kunlun in the Palm and his Immortal Descendant lineage.

Thus, he didn't release his Nascent Soul externally but instead circulated it within his body.

When facing the opponent's attacks, he waited for their power to penetrate his body before absorbing it using Kunlun in the Palm and his Immortal Descendant lineage.

In this way, Zhang Yu's physical body bore the brunt of the attacks, while his internal organs sustained only minor injuries.

Even so, thanks to the defensive power he had honed since high school, culminating in a Physical Divine Ability, his flesh possessed an incredibly high resistance to impact.

To prevent his opponent from gathering intelligence, Zhang Yu deliberately worsened his superficial injuries, using the bloody, mangled appearance to conceal the true nature of his Physical Divine Ability.

Watching Zhang Yu stand motionless, True Monarch Earth Soul snorted coldly and launched another assault.

His Nascent Soul, empowered by the Heavenly Demon Reorganization Technique, hurled itself at Zhang Yu with full force.

A torrent of electric light instantly engulfed Zhang Yu's figure.

The sky erupted with wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, while the atmosphere roared with sword cries as a swarm of magical artifacts converged to strike.

Under this overwhelming barrage, True Monarch Earth Soul was certain that no Nascent Soul Cultivator in the world could withstand such an assault unscathed.

"What will he do?"

"Retreat and flee? Counterattack? Use the Celestial Demon Myriad Transformations to evade?"

Predictions flashed through True Monarch Earth Soul's Bionic Eye, providing detailed combat plans.

But Zhang Yu's next move defied all expectations.

With a casual sweep of his right hand, he created what seemed like a black hole, effortlessly devouring the incoming onslaught.

Then, looking at True Monarch Earth Soul as if he were a child, Zhang Yu said calmly, "Had enough playing around?"

True Monarch Earth Soul's expression darkened. "The Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art? And at such a high level? Isn't he supposed to be a Nascent Soul cultivator from Celestial Monsters University? Even if he's practicing it illegally, could he have reached this level in just a year?"

"Or is he actually a Nascent Soul cultivator from Netherworld University?"

Zhang Yu had just used the Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art, a technique he had chosen from the Military-Grade Technique Selection Pack.

Zhang Yu remembered first encountering this art during the Ten Greats League when facing Kuang Tianqing. He had watched Kuang Tianqing use this military-grade cultivation technique from Netherworld University to absorb various attacks.

Zhang Yu's reasons for choosing this daoist art were simple. First, it left no cultivation traces, making it difficult to detect. Second, it allowed him to conceal his Kunlun in the Palm and Immortal Descendant abilities. By pretending to use the Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art, he could actually absorb his opponents' attacks using the Immortal Descendant and Kunlun in the Palm.

True Monarch Earth Soul, for example, mistakenly believed that Zhang Yu had effortlessly blocked his attack using an extremely powerful Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art.

Seeing True Monarch Earth Soul's increasingly grave expression, Zhang Yu sighed and said calmly, "I don't want to kill anyone from Heavenly Demon University. How about this... I'll stand here motionless, neither dodging nor blocking, and take three more of your attacks."

"If you still can't defeat me after those three strikes, then leave. I won't stop you."

With that, Zhang Yu turned his back, presenting his bare back directly to True Monarch Earth Soul.

Hearing these words, True Monarch Earth Soul immediately assumed it was a tactic — a deceptive maneuver.

But seeing Zhang Yu's motionless posture, his back turned, True Monarch Earth Soul couldn't help but feel puzzled.

He immediately activated the Heavenly Demon Reorganization Technique with his Nascent Soul, simultaneously igniting his flesh, blood, and Magic Power in a violent conflagration.

Life force... burning!

Burning one's life force to amplify the power of daoist arts was a technique mastered by high-level cultivators at Heavenly Demon University.

It was precisely this technique that led to the university's notoriously high life force consumption.

But now, watching the Flying Boat gradually receding into the distance, True Monarch Earth Soul knew he had to act quickly.

Since his opponent had offered him this opportunity, he would unleash his strongest attack, his greatest power, to end this battle as swiftly as possible.

Lightning converged between True Monarch Earth Soul's palms. As the Nascent Soul's hands joined, the lightning surged exponentially, growing brighter and more blinding under the True Monarch's sustained channeling of Magic Power.

Seeing that his opponent remained motionless, allowing him to continue charging his attack, True Monarch Earth Soul roared, his Magic Power surging within him. The lightning in his palms compressed and coalesced, forming a miniature sun.

Output! Compress! Accumulate! Output again! Compress again! Accumulate again!

His lifespan burned away, his Magic Power boiled, and the Spirit Coin bill for this battle skyrocketed.

Yet the results were undeniable.

Under True Monarch Earth Soul's relentless accumulation of power, the miniature sun in his hands bathed the entire world in incandescent white light. Even his palms began to crack and shatter, gradually pulverized by the overflowing energy.

This signified that the Heavenly Demon Reorganization Technique's operational capacity had already surpassed the limits of his control.

"Don't let him evade! And definitely don't let him escape!"

At his command, magical artifacts, Talisman Cultivators, wind, rain, thunder, lightning, and the sword light unleashed by Sky-Patrolling Flying Swords... all converged to seal off every possible escape route for Zhang Yu, poised to intercept him at any moment.

True Monarch Earth Soul channeled the blinding light in his hand, its surging power driving him step by step toward Zhang Yu.

"Three strikes?"

"That won't be necessary."

Under True Monarch Earth Soul's astonished gaze, Zhang Yu remained perfectly still, his back turned, without the slightest movement.

In the next instant, the lightning in True Monarch Earth Soul's hand struck Zhang Yu's body, piercing directly into his flesh.

Immediately, blinding electrical arcs erupted from Zhang Yu's body, rapidly disintegrating his flesh and skin as if he were about to crumble into dust.

"This guy... he's not even dodging?"

Just as True Monarch Earth Soul believed his strike would completely obliterate the Monkey Demon's flesh and blood, he felt the lightning that had entered Zhang Yu's body rapidly dissipate, devoured completely at an impossible speed.

"What?"

"His Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art... it's reached this level?"

Zhang Yu remained motionless, as if nothing had happened, and calmly said, "One strike down. You have two more chances."

True Monarch Earth Soul abruptly retreated, his eyes fixed on the Monkey Demon before him, his heart pounding with dread.

The ease with which Zhang Yu had deflected his attack made him appear impossibly powerful.

True Monarch Earth Soul's mind raced: "This isn't a Rogue Nascent Soul. He's likely a Soul Transformation Candidate from some University, someone capable of contending for the Soul Transformation Certificate."

Zhang Yu slowly turned, his gaze falling on the tense True Monarch Earth Soul. "Hmm? Your spirit has waned," he remarked casually. "It seems there's no need to continue this battle."

"But as I said, I have no desire to kill anyone from Heavenly Demon University. You may leave."

True Monarch Earth Soul gritted his teeth, a flicker of resentment crossing his face. He glanced at the Flying Boat, now soaring toward the heavens, then back at Zhang Yu. Numbers representing Spirit Coins flashed through his mind.

To protect the Junior College Students, True Monarch Earth Soul was prepared to fight to the death.

But this willingness to fight to the death came with a condition: the cost of engagement had to be less than the potential gain.

For instance, his protection of the Junior College Students was aimed at preventing mission failure, avoiding compensation claims, and escaping accountability.

If continuing the battle risked even greater losses, True Monarch Earth Soul would withdraw.

"Has reinforcement not arrived yet?" True Monarch Earth Soul's heart sank as he read the message from Heavenly Demon University. "The Soul Transformation cultivators are engaged at the front lines... Have the other areas also been attacked?"

He took a deep breath. The Monkey Demon before him possessed unfathomable strength, and he had no confidence in defeating it in continued combat.

Meanwhile, the Righteous Qi Alliance's control over the Flying Boat was about to break through the Spatial Lockdown, completely wresting it from his grasp.

"Continuing this fight will only lead to greater losses, while the chances of recovering the cargo are approaching zero."

With this realization, True Monarch Earth Soul's fighting spirit rapidly waned. He retreated step by step, and when Zhang Yu didn't pursue, he accelerated and swiftly fled the battlefield.

After confirming he wasn't being tracked, True Monarch Earth Soul immediately shut down all Spirit Coin-consuming services.

The thought of the battle's losses — the cargo compensation, mission failure penalties, Heavenly Demon University's accountability mechanisms, this year's assessment, the Spirit Coins spent during the fight... True Monarch Earth Soul sighed deeply, feeling as if his heart were bleeding.

Just then, someone from Heavenly Demon University contacted him, asking, "Earth Soul, you withdrew?"

True Monarch Earth Soul immediately adopted a stern expression. "I didn't withdraw. I escaped by the skin of my teeth, preventing the university from losing a top-tier Nascent Soul combatant."

"The opponent's strength far exceeded my capabilities. I strongly suspect they're not just a Rogue Nascent Soul but a high-ranking leader from Netherworld University or Celestial Monsters University..."

On the Flying Boat.

After Zhang Yu and True Monarch Earth Soul leaped off the Flying Boat to engage in battle, 007 and his two companions focused all their efforts on piloting the craft toward their destination.

Night Shift exclaimed, "That was too close! If Qitian hadn't knocked True Monarch Earth Soul off the Flying Boat, we'd all be dead. The cost of resurrection would have been catastrophic."

Simultaneously, the three instinctively glanced toward the battle between Zhang Yu and True Monarch Earth Soul, understanding that Zhang Yu had deliberately stayed behind to delay the True Monarch, buying them precious time.

007 sighed, "Earth Soul's strength far exceeds our estimates. I fear..."

The others understood 007's unspoken concern: Zhang Yu's chances of survival seemed slim.

But then, a blinding light erupted from the battlefield. Moments later, to the trio's astonishment, True Monarch Earth Soul retreated at breakneck speed, while Zhang Yu rapidly caught up to the Flying Boat, landing effortlessly on its deck.

"You!" 007 stared at the unscathed Zhang Yu in disbelief. "Where's True Monarch Earth Soul?"

Zhang Yu replied calmly, "He realized he was no match for me and fled."

"No match? Fled?"

The three found Zhang Yu's words hard to believe, but the reality before them seemed to confirm his account.

"True Monarch Earth Soul's power is already incredibly formidable. How could this Qitian force him to abandon the fight so quickly? What kind of strength does he possess?"

The trio pondered this repeatedly, their minds racing. The more they considered it, the more the Monkey Demon's figure loomed larger in their minds.

Just then, a commotion erupted.

One by one, Junior College Students awoke from the shipping containers, their faces blank with confusion as they took in their surroundings.

007 explained to Zhang Yu, "We activated the Defrosting Formation while we were here, waking up all the frozen cargo."

Simultaneously, Night Shift addressed the crowd of frozen individuals, "Heavenly Demon University has been exploiting you. While you were frozen, they secretly used your bodies for labor..."

Before Night Shift could finish, expressions of dissatisfaction spread across the frozen individuals' faces.

"Who are you? Why did you wake us up? Aren't you just making us lose interest?"

"We're doomed now! Heavenly Demon University will definitely hold us responsible for the losses. We'll have to pay them back..."

"We're doomed! They'll enslave us for free labor!"

Some immediately knelt before the four figures, begging to be refrozen and returned to Heavenly Demon University.

Others tried to secretly report the situation, but found they couldn't connect to the Spirit Realm.

Still others searched for their frozen magical artifacts, such as the Chaos Soil Eater.

It was precisely artifacts like the Chaos Soil Eater that allowed many Junior College Students to better consume and excrete soil, facilitating the plan for Junior College Students to feed on each other.

At that moment, Zhang Yu remained unaware that the magical artifact he and Ye Xingli had co-created was playing a crucial role in this situation.

Faced with the uproar from the awakened frozen people, 007 patiently explained his identity as a member of the Righteous Qi Alliance and described the better lives they would lead after joining the Alliance.

Upon hearing the name "Righteous Qi Alliance," the crowd immediately quieted down. Clearly, they had all heard of the Alliance, and some had even learned about it through the Dark Spirit Realm.

When the sky began to churn and the Flying Boat gradually submerged into the Third Layer, many Junior College Students erupted in cheers.

Those who trusted the Righteous Qi Alliance believed they would find a better life after smuggling themselves in.

Those who didn't trust the Righteous Qi Alliance could only watch in fear and quietly accept their fate.

Before the Flying Boat completely submerged into the Third Layer, Zhang Yu chose to disembark. He had no intention of traveling alone to the Righteous Qi Alliance's stronghold.

007 looked at Zhang Yu and asked, "Qitian, aren't you coming with us?"

Zhang Yu shook his head. "Tell Herald God to settle the mission rewards quickly, or I'll report him to the Righteous Qi Alliance Leader for disrespecting monsterfolk."

With that, his figure flickered and vanished from sight.

007's lips twitched, thinking to himself, "Monsterfolk really know how to play this game. This guy's a natural at it."

Upon receiving 007's report, Herald God mused, "A powerful monsterfolk? Could they be from Celestial Monsters University?"

"It's quite possible. After all, the Mother Dragon's actions at Celestial Monsters University have stirred up a storm of resentment among the monsters. Perhaps many Nascent Soul cultivators are now considering defecting."

"We've always struggled to recruit Nascent Soul experts from the Ten Greats."

"It seems we should abandon our old prejudices and try recruiting monsterfolk from Celestial Monsters University."
