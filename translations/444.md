# Chapter 444: The Victor Has Won, the Defeated Is Not Yet Defeated

As the power of Nine Heavens Cloud Void's twenty strikes per instant dissipated, Ping Han roared and burst from the ground, unleashing a storm of scythe shadows against Zhang Yu.

Thunderous explosions shook the battlefield like a thousand simultaneous lightning strikes.

The Blade Qi in Ping Han's hand transformed into a dazzling comet of emerald light.

Zhang Yu's surging sea of palm strikes, imbued with potent golden and white qi, formed a heaven-rending vortex that relentlessly devoured Ping Han.

The green and gold forces clashed violently, each moment erupting with the force of hundreds of thunderclaps.

Ping Han felt every strike of his blade's Qi twisted, redirected, and transformed into palm strikes hurtling back at him.

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu's own power — the Golden Thread Jade Wall, Earthly Fiend Bottle, and Earth-Suppressing Seal — was continuously converted by the Nine Heavens Cloud Curtain Void Force into palm strikes that bombarded Ping Han.

In this fierce exchange, Ping Han found himself utterly suppressed.

During the battle, Ping Han tried to reactivate his enhanced effects and unleash the Human Dao Torrent, but it no longer affected Zhang Yu.

Did he deactivate his Bionic Eye? Ping Han wondered inwardly.

Zhang Yu had indeed deactivated his Bionic Eye. After completing his appraisal using the Treasure Appraisal Manual and thoroughly analyzing Ping Han's weaknesses, he had temporarily shut it down.

At that moment, he was no longer drawing upon any power from his Bionics. Relying solely on his physical strength, Magic Power, and Gang Qi, he channeled every ounce of his being into his assault.

Every fiber of his strength, every flicker of his thought, was utterly compressed, driven by a single purpose: to defeat Ping Han.

Palm strike, palm strike, another palm strike.

Ping Han felt as if he were being engulfed by a storm of palm shadows.

Zhang Yu before him was like a towering tsunami, his relentless strikes doubling and returning every Blade Qi attack Ping Han unleashed.

Boom!

Another palm slammed into Ping Han's back, yet he remained standing tall, calmly continuing the fight.

How long can you maintain this all-out assault? Ping Han thought to himself. Do you truly believe your martial skills can pierce my armor? How could mere honed techniques ever compare to the protection of expensive armor?

But Zhang Yu's relentless offensive showed no sign of slowing. Soon, Ping Han's initial surprise gave way to growing doubt.

Just when Ping Han thought Zhang Yu's relentless assault was finally waning, and that his opponent was about to crumble, Zhang Yu's offensive surged back to its peak intensity within seconds!

Ping Han's initial hesitation gradually morphed into bewilderment, then disbelief.

Finally, as Ping Han felt another palm strike land on his leg, a sharp crack echoed from within his armor!

"What?"

In the next instant, a series of cracking sounds erupted from the armor. Gang Qi flooded inward, bombarding Ping Han's body!

Amidst the thunderous impacts, crimson mist began erupting from Ping Han's body.

He roared furiously, attempting to retreat, but a blood-soaked figure slammed into him.

"Ping Han."

Zhang Yu, wreathed in scarlet Gang Qi, seized Ping Han's arm.

"If the money you use for crypto trading is truly yours, why are you holding back?" Zhang Yu demanded.

"What nonsense are you spouting?" Ping Han roared, his free hand gathering Blade Qi as he slashed at Zhang Yu.

The two warriors engaged in brutal close-quarters combat, their faces inches apart.

Ping Han's Blade Qi repeatedly tore through Zhang Yu's crimson Gang Qi, while Zhang Yu's palm strikes, penetrating the cracks in Ping Han's armor, hammered mercilessly into his body.

But the next moment, Ping Han felt his Bionic system malfunction. The hand that had just been swirling with Blade Qi went limp.

"What?"

Under Ping Han's shocked gaze, Zhang Yu, covered in blood, grabbed his head.

"Ping Han, the financial pressure from crypto trading has made you too afraid to go all in!"

"Because that money isn't truly yours!"

Zhang Yu's other hand flared with crimson Gang Qi as he unleashed a rapid series of strikes on Ping Han's limbs, instantly paralyzing the Bionic systems in his hands and legs.

Zhang Yu said calmly, "Just a tiny bit of risk, and your entire position would be wiped out!"

You're too afraid to give it your all because you fear market volatility, fear your leverage, fear running out of funds to cover your position!

"That's why, even in the final moments of battle, you're still holding back, too afraid to bet everything!"

Boom!

Zhang Yu, still gripping Ping Han's head, hurled him forward with brutal force.

Ping Han's body stretched into a dark streak as Zhang Yu closed the distance, delivering another punch that slammed him into the ground.

"Ping Han, fight back!"

"You still have strength, you still have money, right? Why are you too afraid to fight back?"

"Are you afraid of running out of your balance and being unable to handle the volatility of the Jade Nectar Coin?"

Ping Han gritted his teeth, glaring at Zhang Yu, who was relentlessly pummeling him. He seemed ready to strike back, but repeatedly suppressed the urge.

With a deafening crash, Zhang Yu shattered Ping Han's chestplate. Grabbing him by the head, he coldly demanded, "Surrender!"

"Is this what you're thinking?" Zhang Yu continued. "That you can't possibly win against me if you keep fighting? And that it would jeopardize your coin trading?"

Ping Han stared intently at Zhang Yu, a flicker of shame and anger crossing his face as if his deepest fears had been exposed.

The moment Ping Han was completely subdued, the audience erupted in cries of despair. Countless text projections filled the arena's sky:

"Zhang Yu, no! Let Ping Han go!"

"What about the coin prices?"

"Please, Zhang Yu, stop!"

"Worthless Ping Han."

Zhang Yu, his Bionic Eye reactivated, looked up at the sky and roared, "Stop trading those damn coins! If there were truly easy money to be made, do you think you'd get a piece of it?"

"Look at him!"

Zhang Yu shook the Ping Han in his hand and roared, "You still want to fight after this?"

For a moment, the words in the sky seemed to freeze!

But the next instant, a burst of laughter erupted!

Ping Han pointed to the coin price displayed on his chest. "It's up again!"

"16.91 now."

"Everyone, it's up again!"

Zhang Yu threw another ferocious punch at Ping Han's head. A deafening crack echoed as blood mist exploded from the helmet!

But the next moment, Ping Han surrendered outright!

"Zhang Yu, victory in this battle is yours."

"You were right. In my eyes, nothing is more important than trading coins!"

Ping Han removed his armor and helmet, looked up at the sky, and raised one finger heavenward while pointing to the coin price on his chest with the other. "Look, everyone! The coin price is up again!"

"Don't worry about the outcome of this minor competition in the Civil Engineering Department. How could that possibly affect the rise and fall of the Jade Nectar Coin?"

"This is the grand strategy of Soul Transformation! The more you buy now, the faster it will rise, and the more you'll profit!"

Zhang Yu stared at Ping Han, whose nose was crooked, face smeared with blood, and eyes swollen shut. Despite his injuries, Ping Han addressed the crowd with feverish excitement, as if he were the true victor!

Meanwhile, the projected text in the sky shifted again, gradually coalescing into massive blocks of... Buy! Buy! Buy! Rise! Rise! Rise!

Watching the relentless flood of characters, Zhang Yu seemed to see countless twisted, fanatical faces through the Spirit Realm Network.

Ping Han beside him burst into laughter. "Everyone, buy Jade Nectar Coins! Let's charge full speed along the Immortal Dao!"

Charge! Charge! Buy! Rise! Buy! Charge!

As Zhang Yu observed this scene, a sense of helplessness washed over him. These guys...

Lady Fortune said, "Don't overthink it. Isn't the purpose of the poor simply to be harvested by the rich?"

"Ping Han's right about one thing: the poor aren't even considered human — they're just ghosts!"

"These Jade Nectar Coins are their tribulation. Only those who overcome this trial have a chance to transform into true humans!"

"And you can bet countless others are desperately clawing their way up just for this single opportunity!"

Zhang Yu said to Lady Fortune in his mind, "I just feel like I won't be able to complete the task Director Gao assigned me!"

Lady Fortune replied, "Director Gao isn't relying solely on you! Besides, this is a clash between Soul Transformation experts — you're just caught in the crossfire!"

Zhang Yu's heart stirred at Lady Fortune's words. "A clash between Soul Transformation experts? Do you mean... the Jade Nectar Coin has already threatened the interests of other Soul Transformation experts, and they might take action against Divine Monarch Jade Nectar?"

Lady Fortune replied, "That's inevitable. Which university or college isn't influenced by Soul Transformation experts?"

"Just trying to hold your ground in this environment is already a monumental challenge. Swimming against the current is even harder!"

As Lady Fortune spoke, Zhang Yu glanced at the messages appearing before him, his gaze shifting slightly.

Che Yufei: Senior Brother, are you really going to sell?

Shi Huaiyu: Junior Brother, did you dump everything?

Su Yanyang: Brother, is there really a risk?

Lady Fortune chuckled. "See? It's already having an effect. Someone will be influenced by what you did today!"

Meanwhile, the moment Ping Han surrendered, Ji Yuanshu and the other four teammates also chose to forfeit. They quickly regrouped with Ping Han and left the arena, showing little disappointment over their defeat. Instead, they chatted animatedly about the coin's rising price.

On the other side, as Zhang Yu led his teammates out of the arena, he noticed that everyone except Xiao Qingxuan wore expressions of conflicted emotions — hesitation, worry, and frustration — with little trace of excitement from their victory.

Zhang Yu couldn't help but say to them, "If you bought Jade Nectar Coins, sell them now!"

"We've already made a profit, right?" Che Yufei asked.

Zhang Yu nodded. "Yeah, I'm selling mine right now!"

He turned to Shi Huaiyu, who looked hesitant. "Senior Sister, sell them!"

Shi Huaiyu struggled. "But... they're still going up!"

"Maybe... we should wait a few more days?"

Zhang Yu shook his head, sighed, and decided not to press the matter further.

Just then, Xiao Qingxuan spoke up from the side. "Huaiyu, sell them. Do you want to lose everything like before? Do you want to have to use the Ghost Kidney again?"

Seeing Xiao Qingxuan's serious expression, Shi Huaiyu sighed. "Fine, fine, I'll sell them!"

Meanwhile, above the arena...

Nine Heavens Liu from the Finance Department chuckled. "Ah, as expected, the people's will prevails!"

"Though Zhang Yu's strength surpasses Ping Han's, he can't suppress the will of the masses, nor the students' determination to get rich!"

Yan Qianji chuckled. "Public sentiment? All I see is your Finance Department manipulating the narrative, stirring up public opinion, and fanning the flames of discontent!"

Nine Heavens Liu replied, "Brother Qianji, your misunderstanding of our Finance Department runs deep! If you're willing, why not visit our department? I'll explain everything patiently. And while you're there, I can help you secure some funding. Your Artifact Refinement Department must be struggling to allocate experimental funds lately, right?"

Yan Qianji tilted his head. "Nine Heavens Liu, your Finance Department will face another reckoning sooner or later! When you're liquidating your assets, remember to save a few pieces of your physical body and Bionic for me. I'll pay top dollar!"

Nine Heavens Liu smiled. "With the economic downturn, many of your Artifact Refinement factories are bleeding money, aren't they? When they go bankrupt, be sure to let me know. I'll buy them at a fair price!"

Their gazes clashed in the Spirit Realm. In the next instant, both figures vanished without a trace.

In the days that followed, Zhang Yu stopped paying attention to the Jade Nectar Coin. He focused on his studies, cultivation, and participating in competitions, living out his university days in peace.
