# Chapter 424: Tower Defense?

Among the three judges, the central figure was a humanoid cloud of mist, with two bolts of lightning flickering like eyes in its head.

Director Gao recognized this was True Monarch Cloud Haven, one of the Vice Principals of Myriad Laws University, responsible for academic affairs and talent cultivation.

For years, True Monarch Cloud Haven had advocated for Immortal Dao cultivation among minors, believing the best path for Kunxu's youth was the graveyard. He had repeatedly proposed allowing individuals under eighteen to cultivate the Immortal Dao and contribute to society.

The cloud-like figure before them was merely an avatar of the True Monarch.

To the left stood a ten-meter-tall Monsterfolk with flag-like teeth, a dragon-like nose, and the bloodline of an elephant monster!

Director Gao knew this was True Monarch Celestial Elephant from Celestial Monster University, a senior expert in civil engineering with significant influence in academic circles.

True Monarch Celestial Elephant was also a master of the living stake technique. To meet a deadline, he had once nurtured three thousand monster fetuses in a single day!

He had repeatedly protested human-monster inequality, arguing that every human should have the right to mass-produce and cultivate monsters!

True Monarch Celestial Elephant and True Monarch Cloud Haven were both seniors whose reputations Director Gao had known for centuries.

Yet every time he saw them again, he had to admit that they had changed tremendously.

They always kept up with the times, constantly evolving their thinking and staying ahead of the curve — truly worthy of being Vice Principals and renowned experts!

Among the three judges, the one on the right was a Fifth-Rank Righteous God named Geng Chenyi, his divine light shimmering.

Director Gao was also well-acquainted with this Righteous God, who had long overseen many affairs in Myriad Laws University City. Geng Chenyi had even led the last campaign to eradicate the Dual Rest Cult!

This time, Geng Chenyi was responsible for maintaining order during the Military Certificate Examination, with the assistance of other Righteous Gods.

As Geng Chenyi moved, his divine power rippled through the Spirit Realm, spreading across the entire examination arena.

His divine sense swept back and forth before he slowly asked, "Is everyone ready?"

In an instant, responses from the Righteous Gods flooded back.

Among them was Deng Bingding, who had once supervised Zhang Yu's Foundation Establishment examination on the first level and later advanced to the second level.

Deng Bingding responded through the Spirit Realm Network, "The examination hall is prepared, and all eight candidates have arrived!"

As she replied, she glanced at Zhang Yu's position, thinking to herself, "Zhang Yu's only a junior, isn't he? Why is he taking the Military Certificate Examination?"

Geng Chenyi turned to True Monarch Cloud Haven beside him and smiled. "Principal, all candidates have arrived. Shall we begin?"

A series of thunderous roars echoed within True Monarch Cloud Haven's body, their overlapping resonance forming a deep, masculine voice.

"Then let the examination commence!"

---

The eight candidates were gazing at the Flying Boat in the sky when, in the next instant, a flash of light appeared before them. Deng Bingding's projection materialized before their eyes.

Zhang Yu's eyes widened slightly in surprise at the sudden appearance of Deng Bingding.

Then, she began explaining the examination's format and rules.

"Two rounds?" Zhang Yu thought to himself. "Eight candidates, each guided to a different location over ten kilometers away in eight different directions."

"The last three to arrive... are immediately eliminated?"

The moment Deng Bingding announced the elimination rule, the students' eyes sharpened.

As the countdown projected into the air, each student prepared themselves.

Ping Han stood atop his Hundred Treasures Box.

Su Yanyang activated his Bionic, levitating into the air.

Behind Xiao Yunji, her Transformation Dharma Armor shifted, unleashing torrents of Gang Qi as her Magic Power surged within her.

3... 2... 1...

Boom!

Like thunderclaps, the countdown ended. The eight candidates vanished simultaneously, streaking away in eight different directions like bolts of black lightning.

Watching them disappear, Deng Bingding muttered to herself, "Even the second-tier funds aren't enough!"

"This Military Certificate Examination is costing a fortune. We had to eliminate three early to stay within budget."

Staring in the direction Zhang Yu had vanished, she wondered, "How far will he make it?"

---

At that moment, every inch of the examination grounds was under the watchful eyes of the Righteous Gods.

On the Flying Boat, scenes from the examination grounds materialized before the three judges and numerous guests.

True Monarch Cloud Haven remarked calmly, "Though the distance is only ten kilometers, the route is riddled with traps designed to impede the candidates' progress."

True Monarch Celestial Elephant nodded in agreement. "The first round serves as a fundamental assessment. It tests both their basic skills and their adaptability."

"Naturally, the bottom three performers won't qualify for the Military Certificate."

With a thought, True Monarch Celestial Elephant summoned a vision of Su Yanyang before him.

Su Yanyang's arms and legs had transformed into crystalline structures crackling with electric arcs, radiating a pulse that sent shivers down observers' spines — his ultimate Bionic suit, the Earth Fiend God.

Why hadn't he donned his speed-enhanced Bionic suit from before? Beset by legal troubles and financial hardship over the past year, he had been forced to sell it before the examination.

Now, empowered by the Earth Fiend God, Su Yanyang hovered in mid-air, defying gravity as he propelled himself forward at astonishing speed.

In the next instant, Su Yanyang felt an immense weight press down on him, as if an invisible mountain had descended upon his shoulders, dragging him toward the earth.

His expression shifted as his Bionic Eye scanned the surroundings. Quickly locating the formation core of the Grand Formation beneath him, he altered his palm seals, unleashing a torrent of mud and sand that shattered the formation.

True Monarch Celestial Elephant casually remarked, "Su Yanyang's reaction is quite commendable."

Switching to Xiao Yunji's perspective, he saw the girl transformed into a towering giant over ten meters tall, her three heads and six arms smashing through formations and traps with unstoppable force.

Watching this spectacle, True Monarch Celestial Elephant chuckled heartily. "Xiao Yunji is truly ferocious! And she's even using Transformation Dharma Armor? Her Dao Heart is admirable!"

Just then, True Monarch Cloud Haven beside him said, "Celestial Elephant, take a look at Ping Han!"

True Monarch Celestial Elephant switched to Ping Han's perspective and saw the young man standing atop a man-high metal box, hurtling toward his destination.

Around him, several magical artifacts orbited tightly, intercepting every incoming threat — whether it was surging Thunderfire or slashing sword qi.

From time to time, the artifacts unleashed fiery dragon blasts, reducing any formations obstructing Ping Han's path to scorched earth.

Throughout the entire ordeal, Ping Han stood with his arms crossed, allowing his magical artifacts to operate autonomously and deflect all incoming attacks. Moving at the fastest speed among the eight participants, he shot toward his objective like a bolt of lightning.

Observing this scene, True Monarch Celestial Elephant chuckled, his elephantine trunk swaying. His gaze swept over the price chart and trading trends of the Jade Nectar Coin displayed on Ping Han's body. "Made a fortune speculating on Jade Nectar Coins? A young man with immortal fortune!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven nodded in agreement. "He came to the Military Certificate Examination right before going bankrupt. Truly blessed by immortal fortune!"

As cultivators who had journeyed from ancient times to the modern era, they understood that the definition of immortal fortune evolved with the times.

In antiquity, immortal fortune meant receiving direct teachings from immortals and achieving enlightenment in a single day, discovering hidden treasures after falling off a cliff, or accidentally consuming rare heavenly materials that granted rapid cultivation progress.

Throughout history, the world had never lacked instances where a single stroke of immortal fortune surpassed decades, even centuries, of ordinary effort.

However, in the modern era, immortals could no longer openly impart teachings, hidden treasures had long been plundered, and unclaimed heavenly materials were scarce.

Yet immortal fortune persisted, merely manifesting in new forms.

Winning the lottery was immortal fortune, profiting from stock investments was immortal fortune, gambling could be immortal fortune, and even making money from cryptocurrency speculation could be immortal fortune!

In short, a sudden windfall is immortal fortune!

To True Monarch Cloud Haven, Ping Han was simply a young man who had stumbled upon such fortune.

What made Ping Han's case particularly remarkable was that, after becoming suddenly wealthy, he had seized the opportunity to take the Military Certificate Examination. This demonstrated an even deeper connection to immortal fortune!

As True Monarch Cloud Haven's gaze swept across the crowd, he instantly calculated the total value of each person's Bionic and magical artifacts.

Ping Han ranked first, followed by Xiao Yunji in second place.

True Monarch Celestial Elephant remarked, "Considering his net worth, overall score, and cultivation level, Ping Han truly has a chance to obtain the Military Certificate!"

"Principal Cloud Haven," he added, "it seems Myriad Laws University will produce another Military Certificate holder!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven replied calmly, "It's merely immortal fortune. Whether he can ultimately seize it depends entirely on himself."

Meanwhile, Director Gao was observing Zhang Yu's perspective through the surveillance feed.

On the screen, Zhang Yu strode forward clad in golden armor, a Golden Jade Wall floating behind his head. Each step he took sent thunderous booms echoing through the earth.

Empowered by the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill and his Body-Protecting Qi, Zhang Yu advanced relentlessly, ignoring the barrage of attacks. He charged through clouds of smoke and dust without faltering.

The Golden Jade Wall behind him periodically released frigid rays, temporarily freezing certain formations in place.

Director Gao observed that while Zhang Yu's speed wasn't the fastest, it was as steady as Ping Han's. Maintaining a consistent pace from start to finish, Zhang Yu reached the target location in fourth place.

Director Gao then turned his attention to Ping Han, the first to arrive, and sighed inwardly. "If Ping Han truly earns the Military Certificate this time, I'll need to have a serious talk with him."

"If he could convert all his Jade Nectar Coins into cash, temporarily abandon coin speculation, and focus wholeheartedly on cultivating the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, he might become another prodigy for our Civil Engineering Department!"

As Director Gao pondered, the last three contestants to arrive were eliminated.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu had caught the attention of True Monarch Celestial Elephant.

The monarch curled his trunk and remarked, "A junior coming to take the Military Certificate? Principal Cloud Haven, your Civil Engineering Department truly produces exceptional talent!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven, equally surprised, began reviewing Zhang Yu's file.

At the same time, the second round of the Military Certificate Examination had already begun.

Zhang Yu stared at the lines of text appearing before him. "Establish a defensive formation, protect the formation core, and withstand the next hour's assault?"

Examining the provided blueprints, Zhang Yu thought, "Wildfire Platform, Soul Condensing Tower, Demon Locking Tower... Are they asking me to build defensive towers? Is this tower defense?"
