# Chapter 646: Immortal Dao Sun

"The first step in advancing the Immortal Dao begins with the Extreme Tiger."

As Tian Shengong took each step forward, the giant puppet behind him unleashed waves of earth-shattering light.

"Every step you take from now on will enhance your Immortal Dao Potential."

Tian Shengong glared at Zhang Yu and roared, "Zhang Yu, you've lost in construction, transportation, communication, power output, and high-temperature resistance!"

"Now, face your complete defeat!"

"Extreme Tiger Overclock! Activate!"

In an instant, all of Tian Shengong's magical artifacts on the battlefield surged with power, unleashing 200% efficiency. Victory in the five-fold competition seemed assured.

The countless Extreme Tiger fans watching the spectacle erupted in cheers across various live-streaming platforms. The tidal wave of comments threatened to engulf the entire battlefield.

But just then, Zhang Yu's eyes flashed, and Spirit Realm Script materialized around him: "Tian Shengong, haven't you realized yet?"

"The key to our battle today has never been about surpassing each other in individual metrics."

"For any product, any combat framework, the most crucial aspect is integration — the seamless fusion of all components, not merely a competition of individual numerical values."

"You and your magical artifacts have focused solely on surpassing me in single-attribute comparisons, neglecting the importance of overall coordination."

As he spoke, deep rumbling echoed from the earth's depths, and the air's moisture content began to surge dramatically.

Twenty-four Mountain-Moving Warriors charged downward with ferocious roars.

Zhang Yu watched calmly, the Spirit Realm Script behind him continuing to materialize.

"Perhaps this is a flaw ingrained by your long history of plagiarism and patchwork — a deficiency that prevents you from truly comprehending the essence of my Immortal Dao Technologies, leaving you only able to grasp their superficial aspects without achieving genuine integration and synergy."

Simultaneously, as the Mountain-Moving Warriors excavated with frenzied efficiency, vast quantities of underground water erupted, surging forth to join the Great Flood controlled by the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor.

Meanwhile, under the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's relentless heat, massive plumes of steam billowed skyward. As dark clouds converged, a torrential downpour finally began.

The Great Flood swept across the land and underground, instantly transforming both construction sites into underwater environments.

Zhang Yu's Mountain-Moving Warriors moved through the surging currents like fish in water, while Tian Shengong's Unceasing Travelers were caught in a whirlpool, their construction efficiency plummeting.

Meanwhile the long-bread army of Demon Beasts surged into the construction site with the flood, assisting the Mountain-Moving Warriors and further widening the gap between the two sides.

The battle of Earthly Fiend Gravity was dragged underwater, giving Zhang Yu an environmental advantage. Each strike and maneuver was amplified by the raging currents.

In moments, as Zhang Yu's various military-grade powers interacted, influenced, and enhanced each other, they coalesced into a unified whole, unleashing an even more formidable and unstoppable force.

Zhang Yu: "Tian Shengong, you've lost..."

Tian Shengong: "I haven't lost yet!"

Tian Shengong knew he couldn't let the situation continue.

He could sense Zhang Yu's abilities merging into a cohesive whole. As time passed, like a snowball rolling downhill, Zhang Yu's momentum would only grow stronger and more unstoppable.

"I can't lose, and Extreme Tiger can't lose either."

"I must stop him from building up this momentum immediately."

At that moment, Tian Shengong decided to go all in.

The construction puppets, the sand-moving machines, and even the surging Spirit Realm signals all weakened dramatically in the next instant.

"Zhang Yu, you said my various powers weren't integrated? You're wrong, completely and utterly wrong."

"Every Immortal Armaments University product and every Extreme Tiger Group creation uses standardized structures."

"This means their power can flow smoothly between them, mutually reinforcing and... amplifying each other!"

In that instant, Tian Shengong withdrew the power from all his other magical artifacts and channeled it entirely into the Giant Puppet. The Giant Puppet, in turn, focused all its power into the twelve Dual Polarity Primordial Magnetic Pearls.

The twelve Dual Polarity Primordial Magnetic Pearls erupted with blinding light, shining like twelve Immortal Dao Suns and illuminating the entire world.

Simultaneously, visible shockwaves surged outward from the twelve pearls. Where the waves passed, the atmosphere twisted, mountains crumbled, and the Great Flood reversed its course.

To wield such overwhelming power, Tian Shengong's meridians swelled violently, nearly bursting through his skin.

Massive streams of data flooded his vision as his brain, working at full capacity to calculate and coordinate, began to overheat rapidly. Cooling devices across his body hissed, releasing plumes of white vapor.

"With the engine at this temperature, all magical artifacts can now operate at their maximum power."

"Now, we'll combine their power and unleash Extreme Tiger's unique overclocked output!"

"By stacking identical magical artifacts, we can unleash performance far beyond their inherent limits — that's the core principle of Extreme Tiger!"

The twelve Dual Polarity Primordial Magnetic Pearls aligned in a row. One pearl absorbed the light from its neighbor, then transferred it to the next in line.

This chain reaction continued, pearl by pearl, until only one remained — a dazzling, incandescent sphere blazing across the sky, while the other eleven dimmed and faded.

"20x Overclock Mode!"

"Zhang Yu, can you withstand this attack?"

Tian Shengong roared, his scalding-red body pressing downward as he hurled the Dual Polarity Primordial Magnetic Pearl like a celestial body crashing onto the battlefield.

He roared inwardly, "This strike is for the countless students, the countless Extreme Tiger users, the countless who seek to advance further on the Immortal Dao, a strike to propel the world forward!"

Tian Shengong, his eyes now completely obscured by blinding white light, glared fiercely in Zhang Yu's direction, his mind screaming, "Zhang Yu! Dharma Realm! Kuang Tianqing! Longevity Technology... all of you will be crushed by this strike!"

"The Immortal Dao Revolution begins here!"

As the Dual Polarity Primordial Magnetic Pearl crashed down with earth-shattering force, Zhang Yu felt the terrifying power within it and couldn't help but feel a surge of dread.

What was the key to defeating Extreme Tiger and Tian Shengong?

Before the battle began, Zhang Yu had repeatedly asked himself this question.

Verbal sparring, influencing public opinion, and drawing his opponent into his area of expertise — Zhang Yu knew these were merely elements of the battle.

"The crucial point is this: since Tian Shengong aims to decipher all my techniques, I must unleash a move beyond his imagination."

The Seven Absolutes Bionic on Zhang Yu's body suddenly blazed to life, its runes glowing with an arcane light, forming intricate patterns across his skin.

At the same time, a surge of heat erupted from his body, venting through the heat dissipation ports of the Seven Absolutes Bionic.

This Bionic, modified by seven Nascent Soul cultivators from the Artifact Refinement Department and personally designed by Zhang Yu, combining his knowledge with that of Magnetic Pole, finally operated at full capacity for the first time.

Simultaneously, lines of text materialized behind his head.

"Tian Shengong, you wanted to break every move I make, didn't you?"

"Then try breaking this one."

As he spoke, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God had already gathered streams of flame, converging them toward the palm of Zhang Yu's hand.

Meanwhile, a gravitational field surged from the Seven Absolutes Bionic, enveloping the Eternal Sun Radiance Flame erupting from the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

Zhang Yu's words continued to project: "Tian Shengong, your actions are like those of someone tracing behind a painter."

"No matter how diligently you try, how desperately you struggle, or how closely you follow..."

"As long as you remain in my shadow, you will always be one step behind me."

As they spoke, the flames enveloped by the gravitational field flickered violently, and vast torrents of water were drawn into the field.

However, instead of extinguishing the flames, the influx of water only intensified the reaction.

Zhang Yu realized that the flames were no longer merely burning; they were exploding!

This creation combined Zhang Yu's Earthly ingenuity with the peak Nascent Soul Immortal Dao Technology of True Monarch Magnetic Pole. The new Seven Absolutes Bionic then connected it to the military-grade power of the Heavenly Sun Radiance God and Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor.

The gravitational field contained the Immortal Dao flames and water, triggering a violent reaction under extreme heat and pressure. The resulting explosion far exceeded Zhang Yu's expectations.

In that moment, an artificial Immortal Dao Sun was born in Zhang Yu's hand.

Sunlight tinged with the radiance of an alien civilization shone for the first time in Kunxu.

Instantly, the Dual Polarity Primordial Magnetic Pearl, once dazzlingly brilliant, seemed to dim in comparison to this true sun.

Boom!

As the Immortal Dao Sun collided with the Dual Polarity Primordial Magnetic Pearl, an incandescent white light engulfed the entire battlefield.

Amidst the stunned gazes of countless onlookers, Zhang Yu's Immortal Dao Sun gradually tore apart and devoured the Dual Polarity Primordial Magnetic Pearl, then blazed even more fiercely.

"What?!" Tian Shengong stared in disbelief, his mind screaming, "What kind of technique is this?! When did Zhang Yu learn such a powerful move?!"

The blinding white light swiftly engulfed the Giant Puppet, unleashing terrifying heat and shockwaves.

As the light converged and gradually dissipated across the battlefield, all that remained was the Giant Puppet, now more than half-destroyed, kneeling on the ground, still tightly protecting Tian Shengong within its body.

Magic Power Circuit Damage: 67%

External Armor Damage: 89%

Perception Module Sensitivity: -33%

The Giant Puppet's parameters flashed continuously across Tian Shengong's bionic eye. The more he saw, the more he grasped the terrifying destructive power of that single strike.

At that moment, he had no strength left to fight.

The thought of the Spirit Coins required to repair the Giant Puppet pierced his heart with anguish.

But when he considered the consequences of losing this battle, Tian Shengong had no time to dwell on his other losses.

Zhang Yu stepped forward, approaching the Giant Puppet.

Watching Tian Shengong, who was climbing out of the puppet amidst billowing white steam, Zhang Yu asked, "Still want to continue?"

Tian Shengong glared at Zhang Yu. "Which company invented this Immortal Dao killing move?!"

Zhang Yu smiled. "What? Planning to copy it again?"

As Tian Shengong retreated from the battlefield in a rage, Zhang Yu let out a small sigh of relief.

That earth-shattering strike had placed immense strain on his physical body, Bionics, and magical artifacts.

The Immortal Dao Sun's impact had left his entire body severely damaged, its operating temperature far exceeding normal limits.

"If I unleashed a second strike, I might actually die."

"This technique still needs refinement."

Meanwhile, True Monarch Tranquility, who had been observing the battle, was inwardly astonished. "Last time, against Nine Heavens Liu, he barely managed to hold out until the end, relying somewhat on luck. But this time, his victory over Tian Shengong was decisive, a frontal assault that crushed his opponent."

True Monarch Tranquility then received a message from the principal:

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: After the battle, have Zhang Yu come see me.
