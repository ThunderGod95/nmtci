# Chapter 152: Spirit Realm Cultivation, the Paupers' Alliance Appears

Just as Zhang Yu was halfway through his deduction, his face suddenly flushed, and he said, “Zhen, if you’re going to run, then just run properly. Can you not jiggle so much?”

Bai Zhenzhen replied impatiently, “Nag! How am I supposed to run fast otherwise? It’s not like I have shock absorbers installed.”

Zhang Yu added, “Then can you retract the electricity? It’s making me uncomfortable.”

Bai Zhenzhen said with disdain, “What’s an Electric Flash Step without the electricity? Your physical body is so strong; a few shocks won’t hurt you.”

After waiting a moment and hearing nothing more from Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen assumed he had no further complaints.

But the next moment, a look of disgust flashed across her face.

“You little bastard… you really should be neutered.”

Bai Zhenzhen felt the current situation was like taking her good buddy for a spin in a brand-new car, only for him to announce he couldn’t hold it in and was about to crap all over the seats.

“I’m warning you, if you try anything funny on my back, I’ll perform the surgery myself today!”

“You think I want to?” Zhang Yu said, uncomfortable. “I told you not to jiggle and not to use electricity. Isn’t this your fault?”

Watching the two of them, Fu Ji thought to herself, *For Bai Zhenzhen to meet Zhang Yu, allowing her spiritual root to evolve so quickly under the nourishment of his many Level 10 techniques, is a form of luck.*

*But conversely, for Zhang Yu to meet Bai Zhenzhen and gain the support and deduction ability of this True Spiritual Root… that too is a form of luck.*

*Zhang Yu accelerated Bai Zhenzhen’s growth, and Bai Zhenzhen, in turn, nurtures Zhang Yu, making him stronger.*

*And for the two of them to have met me is luck upon luck.*

*Fate is truly a damn mysterious thing sometimes.*

*I have a feeling.*

*This time, it might be the most important investment of my life.*

*This time I might… really strike it rich.*

In the blink of an eye, it was after school the next day.

Today was also the day Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen, and Yu Xinghan had agreed to go to the Spirit Realm for their Dao heart tutoring session.

Inside the Songyang High School cafeteria.

Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen, Qian Shen, and Zhao Tianxing were eating together.

The surrounding students cast glances at the four of them, their eyes filled with awe.

“Did you hear? The monthly exam results are out. A teacher said some of Zhang Yu’s and Bai Zhenzhen’s stats have already reached third-year levels.”

“They’re monsters. No wonder they could beat the Student Council President until he knelt on the ground.”

“Knealt on the ground? He was forced to eat his own vomit on the spot! Look, I even have a GIF of it.”

“Isn’t that GIF just playing in reverse?”

“Well, I also have this picture. Look, the words ‘Vocational Student’ were carved on a Student Council officer’s chest…”

“I used to think Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen were friendly, but I never expected them to be so ruthless.”

“All these high-scorers are the same…”

“What’s the big deal? If I were them, I’d be even more ruthless. Otherwise, what’s the point of scoring so high? Top students are supposed to viciously humiliate the slackers! If anyone’s to blame, it’s the Student Council members for not having good enough grades…”

As various rumors spread, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had become akin to school tyrants in the eyes of many students, existences who stood at the apex of Songyang High School’s pecking order, who could be called the Emperors of Songyang.

And the third-ranked Qian Shen and eighth-ranked Zhao Tianxing were also viewed by other students as formidable top students, like great generals under the command of the Songyang Emperors, often flanking Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

Their dining table was the banquet of the first-year titans, radiating a pressure so tangible it made other students feel ashamed of their own inadequacy and dare not approach.

Just then, another group of people entered the cafeteria, led by the fourth-ranked first-year, He Dayou.

Although He Dayou had also become a Purple Person, due to the previous transplant surgery from the special training program, the muscles all over his body were adapting to the super metabolism at different rates.

As a result, some parts were dark purple and others light purple, giving him a segmented appearance.

According to Zhang Yu, He Dayou now looked like a purple mantis shrimp.

But the increase in his strength was undeniable; the Son of the School Director now maintained his fourth-place rank in their year and had become the new vice president of the Student Council.

When he saw Zhang Yu’s table, He Dayou’s steps faltered slightly.

As the Son of the School Director, his first difficult task after becoming vice president was figuring out how to face Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

*By dropping out of the competition, they’ve shown they have completely given up on getting into the Ten Greats.*

*In that case, we are no longer in competition.*

*As for conflicts of interest or old grudges… if there are any, they’re with Zhou Chechen and Lan Ling, not with me.*

*I don’t need to compete with these two paupers. We’re not on the same track anymore. If I get into the Ten Greats, they will seem like ants looking up at the heavens when they see me.*

He Dayou gave an order to a student beside him. A moment later, that student delivered four plates of dietary supplement demonic beast meat to Zhang Yu’s table.

After nodding in acknowledgment to Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, He Dayou turned and went up to the second floor of the cafeteria.

But in his heart, he began to fret over his next problem.

*Can I still get into the Ten Greats?*

*The gap between Songyang High School and the three major high schools is growing wider and wider.*

*For my year, is there still any chance to snatch a spot in the Ten Greats?*

Meanwhile, after Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had eaten their fill, they returned to their apartment, put on their spiritual interface masks, and prepared to attend the tutoring session with Yu Xinghan.

As for these spiritual interface masks, they had also borrowed them from Yu Xinghan.

Now, putting on the masks and entering the URL, the two felt their vision blur, and in the next moment, they had arrived in another world.

The Spirit Realm.

Appearing before Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen was a building that seemed infinitely tall.

Standing before the building, they saw countless people entering and exiting the main doors at every moment.

However, those people were like phantoms; even when they overlapped or passed through each other, it had no effect whatsoever.

Bai Zhenzhen said, “So this is a public area of the Spirit Realm. It’s my first time here.”

Zhang Yu nodded, thinking to himself that this was becoming more and more like a virtual world.

Although they had participated in illusionary landscapes constructed by the Spirit Realm before, those were mostly singular examination environments, like a game that ended once you cleared it.

But the place Yu Xinghan had invited them to was a public area of the Spirit Realm.

It was like a website on the internet, existing perpetually and receiving countless visitors.

But even a place like this wasn't accessible to just anyone; they had paid Yu Xinghan to get temporary access, which was how they were able to come here.

Just then, Yu Xinghan’s figure flickered and appeared beside them. 

“You’re here? Let’s go in together.”

“This is the Immortal Resonance Group’s Dao-Querying Hall, a tutoring institution established in the Spirit Realm.”

“However, the fees in the Spirit Realm are high, and the access requirements are not low. This place has always operated on an appointment and referral basis.”

“But even so, since it caters to the wealthy clients of the entire first layer of Kunxu, the foot traffic has always been considerable.”

Hearing Yu Xinghan’s introduction, Bai Zhenzhen asked in surprise, “The entire first layer of Kunxu?”

Yu Xinghan nodded. “The entire first layer of Kunxu can come here for tutoring through the Spirit Realm.”

As he spoke, the two had already walked inside.

As they stepped through the gate, the light and shadows before their eyes flickered, and they seemed to have been teleported to a certain floor of the building.

Yu Xinghan continued, “This place mainly offers tutoring for the Dao heart and martial arts.”

“After all, the Dao heart can be tempered in the Spirit Realm, and practicing martial arts in the different scenarios here also provides various kinds of experience, but magic power and the physical body ultimately need to be accumulated bit by bit in the material world.”

“There are many methods for Dao heart tutoring.”

“For example, experiencing the lives of the powerful—walking the paths they walked—allows one to constantly approach the Dao hearts that those powerful individuals possessed.”

“There are also things like various extreme forms of suffering, which can also stimulate the growth of the Dao heart.”

“But these either have significant side effects or are slow to take effect.”

“The best method is still to set up various corresponding scenarios for cultivation based on the different heart arts the cultivator practices…”

As he spoke, Yu Xinghan had already skillfully led the two of them into a classroom.

“I’ve rented a Dao heart tempering venue here. We can use it together this time.”

“By the way, what are the heart arts you two need to temper? We need to configure it in advance…”

Just as Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen followed Yu Xinghan into the building.

Outside the Dao-Querying Hall, a blurry figure was constantly monitoring the people entering and leaving.

Suddenly, Mo Tianyi’s voice sounded in his ear. “Boss, Zhang Yu and the others are in.”

The figure asked, “Can you see what they’re doing?”

Mo Tianyi replied, “I haven’t been working here for long. Give me some time…”

A moment later, Mo Tianyi said, “Found them. They’re sharing a classroom with Yu Xinghan, tempering their Dao hearts together.”

The figure asked curiously, “Can a Dao heart tempering classroom be used by three people at once?”

Mo Tianyi explained, “Theoretically, there’s no problem.”

“After all, a Dao heart tempering classroom is essentially a scenario that fits the requirements of a heart art, allowing cultivators to train their heart art with high intensity and strengthen their Dao heart.”

“If three people use it together, it should generate a scenario that simultaneously adapts to all three of their heart arts.”

The figure said flatly, “Show me their situation.”

Mo Tianyi replied, “One moment.”

A moment later, a scene appeared before the figure’s eyes.

Under a sky thick with dark clouds, a factory was operating at full capacity.

Striking workers were protesting outside the factory gates, while security guards formed a human wall, holding them back.

Suddenly, a security guard holding a long staff charged into the crowd and began fighting with the peak Qi Refinement workers.

“Yu Xinghan?” Seeing the security guard who looked like Yu Xinghan, the figure was puzzled. “What technique is he cultivating this time?”

Mo Tianyi said, “The Heavenly Martial Heart-Tempering Art, so they’ve arranged an extremely intense battlefield for him, having him, as part of the company’s security team, represent a corporation that refuses to earn a single cent less and fight fiercely against the bankrupt workers.”

The figure nodded slightly. “Indeed, an extremely intense battlefield. A matter of life and death.”
