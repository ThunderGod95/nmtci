# Chapter 698: Protect Our Blazing Light

Kunxu's Third Layer.

On a vast battlefield not far from the Grand Void.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, currently the strongest member of the Security Department, once known as the most honest Nascent Soul cultivator but now called the Butcher of Myriad Laws, was engaged in fierce combat with numerous Nascent Soul True Monarchs from the Righteous Qi Alliance.

At the height of the intense and grueling battle, a message from Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole suddenly appeared in his Bionic Eye.

"The principal wants to contact me?"

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter knew Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole was currently battling an enemy Soul Transformation cultivator. For the principal to send a message at such a critical moment meant it must be something of utmost importance.

He retreated while fighting, quickly checking the message's contents.

"Go... protect Zhang Yu?"

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter paused, then sighed inwardly. "How pitiful — a message arrives on the battlefield, not about the war, but about a disciple. To think that I, the Security Department's strongest member, suppressing rebels and locked in fierce combat, would be ordered to protect a Second-Generation School Elite..."

"Have they been calling us the Security Department, Security Department... so long that they actually think we're just security guards?"

"I've been saying we should change the department's name to the War Department."

Surveying the scorched battlefield before him, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter muttered to himself, "No, I can't just withdraw like this. What about the battle here? If I don't kill enough to make it worth the investment, what about all the manpower, resources, Magic Power, magical artifacts, and Bionics I've expended? How will I account for all the losses?"

"I'll just pretend I didn't see the message..."

With a flash, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter plunged back into the fray, unleashing a storm of blood and carnage.

But just then, another message arrived from the Magnetic Pole.

Then a third, a fourth... By the time the sixth message arrived, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter knew he could no longer pretend to ignore them.

With a long sigh, he began to retreat, watching his opponents grow increasingly distant. It felt like watching Spirit Coins slip through his fingers.

At the same time, he noticed other Nascent Soul True Monarchs withdrawing from the battlefield, and the entire front line began to collapse.

Glancing at True Monarch Miraculous Hand of the Medical Department nearby, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter couldn't help but ask, "Are you also going to protect...?"

True Monarch Miraculous Hand replied calmly, "To protect Zhang Yu."

Their eyes met, and a shared sense of helplessness flashed between them.

True Monarch Miraculous Hand remarked, "The principal is... a bit too indulgent with his disciples."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's words were even more direct: "Excessive indulgence of favored disciples is the beginning of the end for any sect."

True Monarch Miraculous Hand's expression shifted dramatically, and he waved his hands repeatedly, saying, "Don't speak such nonsense."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter snorted coldly, thinking to himself, "How many Myriad Laws resources has Zhang Yu consumed? Resources from all ten universities? Need I even say more? The key is, after all this time, we've only heard about his Nascent Soul Breakthrough and cultivation progress, but not a word about any mastery of the Immortal Sect Technique."

In truth, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter had investigated Zhang Yu's situation thoroughly. He found no evidence that Zhang Yu had ever spent time cultivating the Immortal Sect Technique, nor had he ever seen him research Spatial Technology. All his efforts were focused on exhausting resources to advance his personal cultivation.

Moreover, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter couldn't help but harbor resentment over True Monarch Azure Void's theft of the Soul Transformation Certificate.

This resentment only deepened when he learned that Zhang Yu had spoken highly of True Monarch Azure Void during the certificate acquisition process.

To True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, it felt like his Spirit Coins had been thrown into the water.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Miraculous Hand thought to himself, "That old bastard Heavenly Slaughter is getting more arrogant lately. Is it because he's been suppressed for so long that he can't control his temper now that he's finally gained power? Or has killing so many people, and the influence of his murderous cultivation art, finally taken its toll on his mind?"

"Magnetic Pole has definitely gone too far. A principal shouldn't act this way, and Zhang Yu's recent behavior has been truly unsightly..."

As True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter and True Monarch Miraculous Hand continued their journey, they observed no fewer than sixteen Nascent Soul True Monarchs heading toward Zhang Yu's location to provide reinforcements.

Seeing this, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter grew increasingly dissatisfied. "Is this really necessary? Do we need to deploy so many of us just to protect one Zhang Yu?"

At that moment, live footage from the scene appeared before True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, allowing him to assess the situation in advance.

He immediately noticed that an entire building had been enveloped by a spatial barrier. Beneath the barrier, the structure was gradually collapsing as three Nascent Soul powerhouses cornered Zhang Yu.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's gaze swept over the three Nascent Soul experts. Drawing on his vast combat experience, he quickly discerned their strengths and weaknesses, even formulating a counterstrategy on the spot.

"Burning Path Life-Lending Sutra... This Flowing Gold is a traitor from Netherworld University's Finance Department. His Nascent Soul has regressed to its infant state, making this his moment of peak explosive power. We can't engage him directly; stalling for time until his energy burns out is the best approach."

"The Concentric Bliss Sutra... a traitor from Joyful Union University? With him here, our magic power will drain even faster. We can't afford to delay. His Concentric Bliss Sutra and the Burning Path Life-Lending Sutra are a perfect match..."

When True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's gaze swept over True Monarch Great Luminosity, the sight of the latter kneeling sent a chill down his spine. He immediately saw through the other's disguise.

"Mysterious Canon of Ancestral Transference... This guy is Great Luminosity?"

"That smooth, practiced, and solemnly dignified kneeling posture... Among the Righteous Qi Alliance, only he possesses such mastery of the Mysterious Canon of Ancestral Transference."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter had clashed with True Monarch Great Luminosity before — the traitor from Netherworld University's Finance Department.

In his mind, Great Luminosity was one of the opponents he least wanted to face.

After all, even if one were severely injured or had their magical artifacts or Bionics destroyed, money could fix it.

But being knelt to by Great Luminosity? That would leave a lifetime of disgust, a loathing so profound that only death between them could resolve it.

Yet Great Luminosity's kneeling speed was terrifying. His kneeling strikes were said to never miss, making them virtually impossible to defend against.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter understood this wasn't just about Great Luminosity's speed. It was also because he only knelt to those he was certain he could subdue, a testament to his impeccable judgment.

"Zhang Yu... Can he withstand Great Luminosity's kneel?"

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter sighed, "I'm afraid he can't withstand it... He's about to become True Monarch Great Luminosity's adoptive father..."

At that moment, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter seemed to already envision Zhang Yu kneeling before Great Luminosity, completely suppressed by the three Nascent Soul cultivators.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter was still some distance from their destination.

True Monarch Miraculous Hand urged him, accelerating again, "Heavenly Slaughter, we absolutely cannot let these three escape."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter nodded. Though he disapproved of Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's excessive indulgence toward her disciples, he understood that if Zhang Yu were severely injured or killed by these three Nascent Soul cultivators, and they allowed the culprits to escape, it would likely provoke Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's immense displeasure.

Just as True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter and his companions were accelerating repeatedly, they noticed that wherever Zhang Yu's palms passed, the surrounding space began to distort violently.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's gaze sharpened. "Spatial distortion?" he murmured to himself. "Could this be... the Immortal Sect Technique Kunlun in the Palm?"

Under True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's watchful gaze, Zhang Yu, at the heart of the battlefield, seemed to have become its conductor. Surrounded by three Nascent Soul experts, he continuously distorted space, redirecting their attacks with effortless precision, like a steadfast reef at the eye of a storm, unshaken by wind and rain.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter exclaimed in astonishment, "Has he truly mastered Kunlun in the Palm to such an extent?"

True Monarch Miraculous Hand, standing beside him, added in surprise, "Scaling space, altering trajectories, shifting positions, redirecting force... To strike him, one would need a wide-area attack, but such an attack would inevitably diminish its power. Yet his own resilience to damage is astonishing."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter analyzed further, "A coordinated assault by multiple opponents would only worsen their situation. Their attacks would interfere with each other due to spatial distortions, even canceling each other out."

He concluded, "With his protective magic and Kunlun in the Palm's spatial manipulation and force redirection, Zhang Yu's greatest strength — and his least fear — lies in facing multiple opponents simultaneously."

Beyond this, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter was struck by a shocking realization.

"When did Zhang Yu master Kunlun in the Palm to this extent? The precision, control, and mastery of Scaling Space and Spatial Distortion he displays... it's as if he's been practicing for decades."

"Who spread the rumor that he hadn't studied Kunlun in the Palm or Spatial Technology?"

As True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter approached the building, he saw the spatial barrier already surrounded by numerous Nascent Soul True Monarchs. Clearly, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had summoned more than just their group.

At that moment, the three Nascent Souls within the barrier made to flee, only to see Zhang Yu pull the World-Piercing Cone from the Great Void Cloud Repository.

True Monarch Miraculous Hand, witnessing this, exclaimed in shock, "The principal gave Zhang Yu the World-Piercing Cone too?"

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, however, remained composed, feeling he now understood Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's actions.

"Zhang Yu... his mastery of Kunlun in the Palm, his grasp of Spatial Technology... it far exceeds anyone's expectations."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter mused inwardly, "The achievements Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole has made in Spatial Technology, as well as the technology contained within the Great Void Cloud Repository, likely owe much to Zhang Yu's support."

At that moment, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter finally understood why Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had been so protective of Zhang Yu. This wasn't merely pampering her disciple; it was safeguarding the school's most valuable asset.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's World-Piercing Cone had already blasted a massive hole through the spatial barrier.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter grinned savagely. He and the surrounding Nascent Soul True Monarchs surged forward like hungry tigers released from their cages, eager to pursue and eliminate True Monarch Great Luminosity and his companions.

But the moment Zhang Yu produced the World-Piercing Cone, True Monarch Great Luminosity and his companions had already made their decision.

"Any resistance is futile," True Monarch Great Luminosity declared. "It would only lead to our capture and a fate worse than death. Let's go."

True Monarch Joyful Ease sighed. "This has been a disastrous loss."

As True Monarch Joyful Ease's body exploded into fragments, a flicker of resentment flashed through True Monarch Flowing Gold's eyes. "Why? Why did we lose? Was there no chance of resurrection? Would no one lend me the money?"

True Monarch Flowing Gold felt a wave of despair as he considered the immense debt he would incur upon resurrection, and the possibility that he might not even have the chance to resurrect, forced to return as a Soul Cultivator.

But he knew he had no time to hesitate.

With a furious roar, True Monarch Flowing Gold detonated his own body.

Simultaneously, True Monarch Great Luminosity on the other side shattered into fragments.

The moment the World-Piercing Cone activated, the bodies of True Monarch Great Luminosity and his companions had already disintegrated, each committing suicide to prevent capture.

As their figures vanished, only True Monarch Great Luminosity's faint words lingered in the air:

"Adoptive Father, until our next... memorial."

Zhang Yu frowned, muttering to himself, "What a damn jinx."

In the next instant, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter and the others had surrounded Zhang Yu.

"Protect True Monarch Blazing Light!" True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter roared, stepping forward to shield Zhang Yu. His Nascent Soul flew out, patrolling the area and imposing martial law, though it was unclear what exactly he was guarding against.
