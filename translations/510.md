# Chapter 510: I'm Done Pretending — I'm a Master Refiner

Watching Zhang Yu accept the blueprints, True Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded inwardly, thinking, "It's not a bad thing for him to focus on solidifying his foundation, diligently studying for a few years to obtain the Class A Military Certificate first, before turning his attention to mastering artifact refinement techniques."

"If he can't persevere, he can always participate in the Artifact Refinement Design Competition later."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole wasn't surprised by Zhang Yu's ultimate choice, but she was curious whether he would change his mind and how far he would ultimately go down this path.

"Alright," True Monarch Magnetic Pole said, waving her hand. "I've explained everything you need to know."

"The specific procedures for transferring departments will be handled by someone else. Just follow their instructions."

"You may leave now."

Zhang Yu nodded and turned to leave.

But before he could go, his gaze flickered, his eyes locking onto True Monarch Magnetic Pole's chest.

Just moments ago, Zhang Yu had seen a flash — a few words seemed to float across her chest.

Sensing Zhang Yu's movement, True Monarch Magnetic Pole tilted her head and asked, "Is there anything else?"

Zhang Yu quickly shook his head and said, "It's nothing."

Is that a Dao Seed? he wondered inwardly.

Was that the Dao Seed I just saw on True Monarch Magnetic Pole?

Too bad it flashed by so quickly. I couldn't even get a clear look at it.

But if it was a Dao Seed, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's Dao Seed must be incredibly helpful for artifact refinement.

I should visit my Master more often in the future and try to copy her Dao Seed as soon as possible, Zhang Yu thought.

He then glanced at the design blueprints for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God Prototype Machine, his heart stirring with excitement.

Simultaneously, he instructed, "Lady Fortune, please carefully review these blueprints for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God Prototype Machine. Compile all the techniques True Monarch Magnetic Pole has summarized that need to be mastered."

"Then, based on that information, create a list of magical artifacts that incorporate those techniques."

This would save Zhang Yu a significant amount of research time, allowing him to focus on practicing the artifact refinement diagrams according to the list.

"Ah?" Lady Fortune exclaimed. "Me?"

Zhang Yu replied, "The company is facing a crisis right now. Shouldn't you be proactively helping your boss alleviate his worries?"

Zhang Yu himself wasn't in a hurry to study the contents. Instead, he turned and ran toward the construction site on the 669th Floor.

Ever since the Civil Engineering Competition Finals, Zhang Yu's account had been nearly empty, leaving him feeling deeply insecure.

Immediately after the competition, he had rushed back to Myriad Laws University for the victory banquet, toured the Finance Department, met True Monarch Magnetic Pole... It was one event after another, barely giving him a moment to catch his breath.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "With this little money... I'd go bankrupt just from accidentally bumping into a few people on the street."

"No, I need to earn some money quickly to calm my nerves."

So, he headed straight to the familiar construction site on the top floor and started working as a day laborer.

Although the Finance Department had used its connections to cut off his company's projects, they couldn't stop Zhang Yu from taking odd jobs.

Still, many workers on the site whispered among themselves in the Spirit Realm as they watched him.

"Zhang Yu's working as a day laborer now?"

"Sigh, what else can he do after offending the Finance Department? He has military-grade strength from the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, yet he's stuck doing the same work as us."

"He's getting too cocky. Just because he won first place in the Inter-University Competition, he thinks he can challenge the Finance Department? Even the strongest Civil Engineering Department is still just the Civil Engineering Department."

Hearing similar rumors nearby, Ji Yuanshu deliberately took a long detour to observe Zhang Yu.

He watched as Zhang Yu extended his palm, and the steel bars and concrete across the construction site seemed to come alive. They snapped, twisted, reshaped, and poured into place as if guided by an invisible hand.

Ji Yuanshu's expression was complex as he witnessed this scene.

News of Zhang Yu's rejection of the Finance Department's invitation had already spread throughout the Civil Engineering Department. Ji Yuanshu was neither blind nor deaf.

Watching Zhang Yu working diligently on the construction site, Ji Yuanshu thought to himself, "What's this guy thinking? Rejecting the Finance Department's invitation? Doesn't he realize what a huge opportunity this is? It's a golden ticket to success!"

Ji Yuanshu simply couldn't comprehend Zhang Yu's thought process.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu paid no attention to the onlookers.

To him, work was work, no matter where it was. With the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power enhancing his abilities, his piecework wages on the construction site were substantial. The real-time earnings displayed in his Bionic Eye increased steadily every second.

Just then, several foremen rushed up to Zhang Yu, their faces apologetic. "Zhang Yu, we're sorry, but there's been a mix-up. Your work assignment has already been given to someone else. There might not be any suitable work for you here..."

Zhang Yu frowned slightly. "Are temporary jobs on the 669th Floor also under the Finance Department's jurisdiction?"

One of the foremen sighed helplessly. "The real estate company investing in University City has always been backed by the Finance Department. Please don't make things difficult for us."

Zhang Yu shook his head, too weary to argue with the foremen. He collected his current wages and decided to find a project without Finance Department ties.

Those Finance Department guys really hold grudges, Zhang Yu thought.

Lady Fortune remarked, "Those who submit prosper, those who resist perish. How else can they establish sufficient authority without repeatedly resorting to ruthless measures? For the Finance Department, maintaining this aura of power and prestige is essential for streamlining investment projects and manipulating Qi Luck."

"But anyway, the Artifact Refinement Department will back you up soon. Why are you so desperate to earn money right now?"

"If you're really worried about being broke, just take some from the company."

Zhang Yu asked, "Take some from the company?"

Lady Fortune suggested, "Have Zhao Tianxing and Mo Tianyi defer their salaries. You can use their wages to tide things over for now and pay them later."

Zhang Yu shook his head. "Junior College Students and Soul Cultivators live hand-to-mouth; they need their money urgently every day... Let's not do that."

"Besides, with the company's projects stalled, their incomes have already plummeted."

Just then, Zhang Yu received a message from Ying Xin's grandfather.

Ying Xin's Grandfather: President Zhang, I've discussed the situation with the company employees.

Ying Xin's Grandfather: Everyone understands the company is facing difficulties. We'll find temporary jobs to manage.

Ying Xin's Grandfather: You don't need to rush paying the outstanding salaries. We can wait until the company stabilizes.

Lady Fortune scoffed. "Hmph, paying them on time was already a great kindness. Why does he need to say that? Isn't he just trying to curry favor now that you're joining the Artifact Refinement Department?"

At that moment, a familiar figure approached Zhang Yu.

Li Xiao, his face covered in soot, asked, "Senior Brother, are you alright?"

Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "What could possibly be wrong with me?"

Meanwhile, Ying Xin, Gongshu Jin, Yu Xinghan, and Shi Yunxiang had also arrived, all expressing concern about the Finance Department's suppression of Zhang Yu.

At the same time, messages continued to flood Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

Feng Tingting: Are you okay? The Civil Engineering Department can't stand up to the Finance Department. Should we ask Senior Sister Ye Xingli for help? She can contact True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

As she spoke, Zhang Yu passed through the construction site gate and received another message in his Bionic Eye.

His Inter-University Competition championship record had been successfully registered within Myriad Laws University, causing his overall score to skyrocket instantly.

Before the eyes of the surrounding security guards, workers, and students, Zhang Yu's aura surged dramatically. The ranking above his head climbed rapidly, leaping to 20th place... 15th place... 10th place...

Finally, it surged all the way to 8th place in a single breath.

The crowd watched this astonishing spectacle in shock, some snapping photos while others gasped in amazement.

In addition to the overall score increase, the university's internal reward of 20 Spirit Coins was immediately credited to Zhang Yu's account, providing some much-needed relief to his dire financial situation.

Simultaneously, as his competition results were officially recognized, triggering the explosive rise in his overall score and ranking, another message arrived for Zhang Yu.

It was True Person Refining Fire from the Artifact Refinement Department.

True Person Refining Fire: "Hello, Zhang Yu. I'm your future class teacher in the Artifact Refinement Department."

True Person Refining Fire: "The department head asked me to help you with the transfer procedures. I'll need some documents from you."

It was during this process that Zhang Yu learned that transferring from the Civil Engineering Department to the Artifact Refinement Department meant his overall score would be discounted.

In particular, the overall scores he had earned from various competitions would be subject to complex calculations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. While the official explanation cited various industry factors, Zhang Yu saw it as blatant professional discrimination, ultimately reducing his overall score by more than half.

True Person Refining Fire: "Planning to change dorms? I can arrange that for you."

Zhang Yu: "Not yet."

Although Zhang Yu didn't want to change dorms, he remembered that his current accommodation had been provided by Director Gao of the Civil Engineering Department. He knew he needed to consult Director Gao before making any decisions.

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu communicated with True Person Refining Fire, he suddenly froze in place, drawing the attention of everyone around him.

Li Xiao asked, "What's wrong with Senior Brother?"

Ying Xin replied, "The final competition scores must have been finalized. That's why his ranking skyrocketed. He's probably talking to the department leader now."

Gongshu Jin sighed, "Ah, it's probably something to do with the Finance Department."

"The Finance Department's influence runs deep, touching every aspect of the university."

The Civil Engineering students felt a pang of sympathy when they realized that even Zhang Yu, one of their department's top students, couldn't be protected by their teachers against the Finance Department's power.

But just then, the ranking above Zhang Yu's head began to shift again.

Li Xiao thought, "It's still rising?"

This time, however, it wasn't an increase but a drop.

Yet despite the drop, the surrounding crowd's gazes grew even more astonished, more awestruck. Zhang Yu's aura seemed to surge — wildly, explosively, violently!

The ranking above his head had changed from the Civil Engineering Department's list to the Artifact Refinement Department's list.

He had gone from a dismal 8th place in Civil Engineering to a dazzling 48th place in Artifact Refinement.

He was a master refiner!

Li Xiao exclaimed, "Senior Brother! You! You! You! You transferred to the Artifact Refinement Department?"

Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "I originally wanted to quietly hone my skills in Civil Engineering, but all I got was humiliation and oppression from the Finance Department."

"So I decided to stop pretending."

"I'm revealing my true colors."

"I'm a student of the Artifact Refinement Department."
