# Chapter 101: A Concealment Talisman and the Eve of the Competition

Hearing Lan Ling's words, Zhang Yu asked, “What are the selection criteria? Why don’t we meet them?”

Lan Ling gave them a cold glance and stated flatly, “The initial phase requires a capital investment of at least three million. Do you have that?”

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen were instantly speechless. Where would they get that kind of money? Even if they did, they certainly wouldn't invest it in a project led by the Student Council.

Seeing that Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had no reply, Lan Ling thought to himself, _So they really are broke? It seems Zhang Pianpian knows her limits and didn’t support their bid to join the special training program._

After saying this, Lan Ling turned and left, seemingly unconcerned with the remaining affairs of the competition team.

Zhang Yu, however, asked again, “Hey, what about the other benefits for the competition team? Doesn’t the school offer us any training or subsidies?”

Without turning his head, Lan Ling replied, “That’s not my responsibility. Go ask Wang Hai.”

Wang Hai came over to Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen and said, “The second-year sports competition is in two weeks. Lan Ling and the others need to hurry up with their body tempering to prepare.”

“I’ll be the one to explain the situation for the first-year competition team.”

Wang Hai smiled at the two of them. “I originally thought you two wouldn’t have the chance to compete. I didn’t expect you to find another way and actually catch up.”

“Don’t worry, you don’t have to explain it to me. I know these kinds of things involve signed contracts and can’t be casually disclosed.”

Evidently, Wang Hai was convinced the two had used some kind of powerful Immortal Dao technology.

He continued, “The competition team has quite a few benefits. I’ll go over them with you one by one.”

“First, all members who join the competition team will receive a complimentary set of the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique.”

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's and Bai Zhenzhen’s eyes lit up. A free cultivation technique? How could it be this good?

Zhang Yu asked, “The Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique… is it an acupuncture method? A set of combat arts? Why would the sports competition team need to practice combat arts?”

Wang Hai smiled faintly. “The Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique isn't for combat; it’s a standard body tempering cultivation technique.”

“It uses mana to operate syringes, injecting different medicinal agents into 36 specific points on the body with various techniques and different syringes to maximally stimulate human potential and enhance the effects of body tempering…”

Zhang Yu was taken aback. _Damn, this is Songyang High School, all right. The competition team and the PE classes really do share the same style of body tempering._

Wang Hai went on, “The second benefit is a discount on drugs.”

“The Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique requires a combination of nine different body tempering agents. Coincidentally, we sell all nine of them right here. They’re all from major, reputable brands, and they’re all sold at a discount to team members, so you can inject with confidence and use them with ease.”

Zhang Yu secretly shook his head. He didn't have any extra money to play around with this Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique.

Bai Zhenzhen, on the other hand, was listening with rapt attention. She was clearly very interested, being a top student in body tempering who had long relied on alchemical enhancers.

Wang Hai continued, “The third benefit is that if a team member purchases an expert-level body tempering cultivation technique, they can apply for a subsidy from us. Regular members get a 2,000 subsidy, but if you get a rank in the competition, the subsidy is higher, up to a maximum of 20,000.”

“The fourth benefit is that the training equipment here is available for your free use 24 hours a day. You can go register your information in a bit, and then you’ll be able to get in just by swiping your student cards.”

“The final benefit is that you can buy dietary supplement foods from us at a discount, including all kinds of demonic beast meat…”

Bai Zhenzhen immediately asked, “Can we buy synthetic food from you at a discount then?”

_Synthetic food? What class of item is that? Would our competition team sell it?_ Wang Hai had intended to say this, but looking at the expectant gazes of Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu, and considering their impoverished status, he finally cleared his throat and said, “Mm, you can get a ten percent discount, I suppose.”

Bai Zhenzhen immediately broke into a smile.

Wang Hai thought to himself, _It’s just a matter of submitting an application anyway. Since these two kids are on the competition team, a full stomach might help them get better results for me._

Zhang Yu, standing to the side, thought, _From the looks of it, the third and last benefits are the most useful for us._

_But the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi was a prize given to me for free, so I can’t apply for a subsidy for it._

_If I were to buy another expert-level body tempering cultivation technique… I’ll have to give it some serious thought._

However, Zhang Yu’s goal was definitely the highest-tier subsidy of 20,000, which meant he would have to wait until after participating in the sports competition a month from now and securing a ranking.

But at that moment, Zhang Yu couldn't help but ask, “For the subsidy, does it have to be a body tempering cultivation technique?”

Wang Hai replied, “Of course. This is the sports competition team, after all. If you’re not buying body tempering techniques, should we be subsidizing combat techniques or breathing exercises for you?”

After completing the procedures to join the team and receiving a digital manual and usage rights for the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique from Wang Hai, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen left the stadium.

After all, they were carrying too many secrets now and it wasn’t suitable for them to stay and practice body tempering there.

---

That night.

Under the bridge, beside the riverbed.

After finishing their tutoring session, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen leaned against each other, staring together at the Talisman Tome in their hands.

For some time now, before every session, they had been requesting talismans from Zhang Pianpian over the Heavenly Net.

Now, after this night's class, the two had finally saved up enough money to buy the usage rights for the Concealment Talisman.

“Yu-boy, I’ve transferred the twenty thousand to you. From now on, whenever I want to use a Concealment Talisman, you have to draw it for me.”

Zhang Yu patted his chest. "Brothers for life. I’d flake on anyone before I’d flake on you. Don’t worry, whenever you need one in the future, I’ll draw one on the spot.”

Zhang Yu opened the Talisman Tome, entered the Department of the People's Spirit Realm temple, and selected the option to consult a god.

A huge list of options instantly popped up. Zhang Yu scrolled down past god-to-human training, god-companion modes, and divine-son packages, finally finding the option for talisman bestowal.

Among the many talismans offered by the Department of the People, the Concealment Talisman was ranked at the very top, clearly the most frequently used and purchased.

Seeing this, Zhang Yu couldn't help but curse inwardly, _These money-grubbing righteous gods. Was it them who pushed the schools to teach the Heaven's Eye Talisman?_

_With everyone learning the Heaven's Eye Talisman, of course many people would need to buy Concealment Talismans. If that thing didn't exist, no one would need to buy these either…_

Zhang Yu selected the Concealment Talisman and saw that the basic version required 40,000 yuan.

Just as a notification of a 40,000 deduction from his bank account sounded, the image on the Talisman Tome changed. Three righteous gods suddenly appeared, seemingly able to see him through the screen, and gave him a slight smile, their faces full of appreciation for a promising talent.

At the same time, three voices exploded in his mind simultaneously.

“The disciple Zhang Yu, with a heart devoted to the Dao, of sincere piety and superior aptitude… is hereby granted this talisman. It is hoped that you will practice it diligently in the days to come and spread the divine way far and wide.”

The next moment, the specific details of the Concealment Talisman were displayed before him.

The basic version didn't have much content. After flipping through a few pages, Zhang Yu saw a recommendation to upgrade to the advanced version.

Concealment Talisman Upgrade to Advanced Version, Basic Version

Conceal component function, √, √

Component color-change function, √, X

Individually hide components, √, X

Personalized camouflage signature, √, X

Forced display function, √, X

…

…

Zhang Yu gave it a quick glance and looked away. The advanced version of the Concealment Talisman had many functions, but it was far too expensive.

“The upgrade costs a full hundred thousand. With that kind of money, I’d be better off spending it on my own cultivation.”

The doll, disguised as prayer beads, had been silently watching this unfold, growing more envious and jealous by the second. It couldn't help but think, _Those righteous gods are really just lying around making money every day now._

_We evil gods have to brave the elements, take enormous risks, and rack our brains just to swindle a single person out of their family fortune._

_Those guys just have to lie back in the thirty-six heavens, eating and drinking and having fun, and billions of beings will offer up their life savings with both hands._

_Damn, that’s the life! Why was I born an evil god? I want to be a righteous god too!_

Meanwhile, after studying the Concealment Talisman for a while, Zhang Yu extended a finger and began to draw shakily on the Talisman Tome.

A moment later, with a flash of the yellow paper on the tome, the Concealment Talisman was successfully cast upon himself.

“Did it work?” Bai Zhenzhen asked excitedly from the side. “Come on, try casting one on me.”

Zhang Yu quickly drew another one, but just as the talisman was completed, his free daily quota on the Talisman Tome having been used up, his phone vibrated.

Department of the People - All-Beings Innate God

Debit: 500

“This one costs 500?”

“Didn’t I buy the usage rights?”

Zhang Yu quickly looked at the talisman bestowal page and only then discovered that for the basic version of the Concealment Talisman, one could only purchase paid usage rights.

This meant that having the rights simply allowed Zhang Yu to spend 500 yuan to use the Concealment Talisman once.

Zhang Yu laughed in exasperation. He wanted to curse out the Eight Ministries of Righteous Gods, but he was afraid of being overheard by them, especially while holding the Talisman Tome. What if they hit him with some kind of fine?

He had heard news of people cursing the heavens and being fined over a hundred thousand for it.

There was nothing for it. Zhang Yu couldn't afford to curse gods right now, so he could only swallow his anger.

At that moment, Zhang Yu also had a sudden realization as to why Zhang Pianpian’s expression had grown increasingly grim each time she drew talismans for them remotely as their tutoring sessions went on.

Bai Zhenzhen, who was beside him, also saw the debit notification on his phone and sighed, “I wonder how much money Godmother spent drawing talismans for us all these days?”

Zhang Yu didn’t know, but he guessed that drawing talismans remotely must be quite expensive, so he nodded. “Big Sis is so good to us. We have to repay her properly and fulfill our filial duties once we get into university.”

In the days that followed, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen continued to shuttle between the Dark Learning Gang and Songyang High School, attending classes, teaching, and cultivating.

As Ma Yunteng and Le Mulan’s fame began to spread a little in the dark world of tutoring, the number of students enrolling in their courses increased slightly, and their income rose as well.

---

In the blink of an eye, another two weeks passed. It was the day the latest monthly exam results were announced, and the first-year sports competition was only two weeks away.

Inside the classroom, He Dayou looked at the score rankings and sighed softly to himself.

First place, Zhang Yu, 665

Second place, He Dayou, 661

Third place, Bai Zhenzhen, 660

Although it seemed like only a few points separated them, He Dayou knew it was because the 150 points for mana and physical education were no longer sufficient to reflect the true strength of Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

As for himself, besides the general knowledge courses, He Dayou hadn't maxed out a single subject; he had relied mainly on his Daoist art scores to close the gap with Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

Moreover, according to news passed on from other students, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had earned high praise from several PE teachers during the exam, repeatedly breaking the diagnostic patches. Wang Hai had even called the pair the treasures of Songyang High's first-year athletics.

_Is it because I’m not as rich as Zhang Pianpian?_

He was not naive enough to think he had lost to things like talent or hard work.

In He Dayou's view, the only reason someone as wealthy as him could lose in the sports competition… was because his opponents were even wealthier.

_Perhaps the Zhang family isn't as wealthy as the He family, but the amount of money the He family has spent on me probably can't compare to what Zhang Pianpian has spent on Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen._

_Damn it, why do those two paupers have such good luck? How did they run into a major sponsor like Zhang Pianpian?_

As He Dayou was stewing in his thoughts, he suddenly noticed his phone buzzing nonstop, as if some news was spreading like wildfire through various group chats.

He opened it and took a look, his expression changing repeatedly.

[The second-year competition team was completely wiped out! The top ten places in the sports competition were all seized by White Dragon, Purple Cloud, and Red Pagoda!]

[The Oasis Group has partnered with the companies behind White Dragon, Purple Cloud, and Red Pagoda, sharing some of the Immortal Dao technology for physical cultivation from their synthetic food.]

No wonder the Oasis Group could enter the Songyang City market; they joined forces with the local companies!

[Songyang High's Immortal Dao technology is completely obsolete. The three major high schools have achieved a comprehensive breakthrough in body tempering techniques. The new generation of top students has seen their physical strength skyrocket. In the future, they’ll even dominate the sports competitions. All future competitions will have nothing to do with the other high schools anymore.]

Reading this, He Dayou suddenly let out a bitter laugh.

He felt as though they were all just a bunch of clowns. While they were here, chasing after one another, the students from the three major high schools had already boarded a flying ship to another level.

# Chapter 102: The Competition Arrives

Night.

Beside the riverbed.

Zhang Yu’s muscles twitched and pulsed as he circulated the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi with the aid of the True Spiritual Root.

Ever since joining the sports competition team and securing a spot in the athletics meet, Zhang Yu had not once returned to the team’s training gym, instead continuing to cultivate quietly as before.

After all, the 30,000-yuan Crimson Marrow Primordial Pills had consumed the vast majority of his income, and he had no money to enjoy the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique and related alchemical enhancers provided by the team.

Bai Zhenzhen, on the other hand, didn't need to spend her money on something as expensive as the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill, so she learned the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique and bought the related drugs from the competition team to try them out.

Bai Zhenzhen’s review of the team’s training method was: “After the shots, you can’t get full, you can’t fall asleep, and you can’t stop training. The body tempering effects are insane! Yu-boy, using enhancers is so much more effective than natural body tempering. You should hurry up and try it.”

Of course, Zhang Yu knew that Zhen could handle the acupuncture not only because her drug resistance was quite good, but also because she had the assistance of the True Spiritual Root. Furthermore, the spiritual root had recently begun to transfer a portion of the effects from his own Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi cultivation, strengthening her internal organs…

Just then, his phone vibrated. Zhang Yu opened it to find a message from Zhao Tianxing.

“Hm?”

It was the news that was currently spreading like wildfire through all the Songyang High group chats: the complete defeat of Songyang High's second-year students in the sports competition, Oasis Group's sharing of partial Immortal Dao technology, the comprehensive breakthrough in body tempering techniques at the three major high schools, and the soaring physical strength of their top students across all grades…

Zhao Tianxing knew that Zhang Yu spent nearly every second of his time cultivating and couldn't be bothered to look at group chats, having muted all the Songyang High student groups he had joined. That was why he had sent the message directly to his good friend to give him a heads-up.

After reading it, Zhang Yu was quite surprised. “Lan Ling and that group of second-years, they all lost?”

“New technology? I wonder how much Song Hailong and the others have grown… Maybe I can ask my sister.”

Zhang Yu knew that Lan Ling's skill was by no means weak. For him to not even make it into the top ten of the athletics meet, it was clear that the students from the three major schools must have made significant progress after obtaining the breakthrough in body tempering technology.

Feeling a hint of pressure, Zhang Yu could only calm his mind and refocus his attention on cultivating the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

A short while later, Bai Zhenzhen, now wearing a blonde wig, stick-on tattoos, padding, and a mask, came running over.

She leaped gracefully onto Zhang Yu's back, skillfully hopping on and wrapping her arms around him from behind. “It's time, Yu-boy. We need to get to class.”

At the same time, the True Spiritual Root flashed faintly and slipped back into Bai Zhenzhen’s stomach, making her feel a wave of comfort.

With the True Spiritual Root switching back and forth between their bodies during this period, Bai Zhenzhen wasn’t sure if she had adapted to the shape of the root after Zhang Yu had stretched it, or if the spiritual root had adapted to their two forms. Now, the transfers were almost free of the previous discomfort, leaving only a refreshing sensation of spiritual energy infusing her body.

Zhang Yu activated his Sports Car Legs, dashing toward the industrial park like a gust of wind. As his physical strength had surged, the speed of his technique had also become faster and faster.

Feeling Bai Zhenzhen's head resting on his back, Zhang Yu said, “Zhen, you’re pretty fast now too. Have you considered learning Sports Car Legs for travel? This cultivation technique is really useful.”

“No.”

Leaning on Zhang Yu’s back, Bai Zhenzhen closed her eyes, comfortably circulating her breathing exercise to seize the moment and refine her mana.

Seeing that Zhen didn't seem to get his meaning, Zhang Yu decided to be more direct. “Sigh, running such a long way every day, I feel like my shoes are about to wear out.”

Bai Zhenzhen, however, kept her eyes tightly shut as if she hadn't heard a thing, continuing to absorb spiritual energy through her breathing.

_Is Yu-boy trying to hint at something? Does this guy want to turn the tables, make me learn Sports Car Legs, and carry him so he can cultivate on the way? Silly child, whoever gets to ride on top would never be willing to get down._

Feeling Bai Zhenzhen seem to hug him even tighter, resolute in her decision not to get off, Zhang Yu cursed inwardly.

_This girl, Zhen. I was hoping that once she got stronger, she could carry me for a bit too. Good brothers should take turns riding each other, and I could get more time to cultivate. But now she won't even be my running partner. She's just using me as a chauffeur, cultivating while I'm running every day._

So Zhang Yu thought for a moment and said, “I always feel like it's not good for one person to do all the running. If both of us could run, it would be like having dual engines. If one gets sick or injured, the other can still go, don't you think so, Zhen?”

But Bai Zhenzhen seemed not to hear, only clamping her powerful thighs tighter around Zhang Yu, the sound of her breathing exercise echoing like thunder.

Zhang Yu thought, _This girl… she’s pretending not to hear me again, isn’t she?_

Bai Zhenzhen thought, _Good son, you want me to get down already? You have no idea how thick-skinned your old mom can be!_

_I could ride on you for a year without getting off!_

In the days that followed, as the sports competition drew ever closer, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, amidst their constant ascetic training, gradually felt a growing sense of urgency.

Fearing that they wouldn't achieve a good ranking in the competition, they always seized every possible opportunity to become stronger.

And so, time passed day by day in their arduous cultivation…

---

On this day, inside a training room at Purple Cloud High School.

Bai Zhenzhen walked in, a little puzzled, and looked at the slightly panting Le Mulan. “You asked me to train with you?” she asked curiously.

Le Mulan nodded. “I need to practice my close combat.”

“But I’m telling you beforehand, no moves like spitting blood or saliva.”

Actually, the training partner Le Mulan had wanted to hire was Zhang Yu.

But she felt that the leap from his clothes to the man himself was a bit too large. If he were to end up sitting on her again… she was afraid it would leave an even deeper shadow on her heart.

_It just so happens that this Bai Zhenzhen is also poor, and she’s with Zhang Yu every day. Her bottom line is probably just as low. I’ll test the waters with her first._

After a few moments of combat, Le Mulan confirmed her suspicions. _The other person’s scent on Zhang Yu’s clothes is Bai Zhenzhen’s._

_And Bai Zhenzhen has Zhang Yu’s scent on her as well._

_Those two… they must be doing close-quarters combat training together every day, right? That’s why they’ve left their scents on each other._

_So right now, I’m indirectly training with Zhang Yu._

At this thought, Le Mulan felt her breathing quicken and her nerves tense slightly.

_I knew it. I have to keep training._

An hour later, the training ended. Bai Zhenzhen looked at the 5,000 yuan that had been transferred to her account and felt a complex mix of emotions. _These guys from the three major high schools… they really have money to burn._

---

On this day, within the Dark Learning Gang's compound.

As soon as Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen entered the underground classroom, they noticed that many people they passed—security guards, teachers, salespeople—were injured.

Upon asking, they learned that the Dark Learning Gang and the Golden Class Gang had clashed yesterday over student recruitment.

Zhang Yu asked again, “Where’s Cai Tou? Why haven’t I seen him?”

Che Nu sighed, a trace of sadness in her eyes. “Oh, Cai Tou left.”

Zhang Yu was surprised. “He… did something happen during the fight?”

Che Nu smiled at his words. “How could that be? Cai Tou is very strong; he wouldn’t die in a small skirmish like yesterday’s. He was… fired.”

Zhang Yu said, “Fired? If he’s so strong, why was he fired?”

Che Nu shook her head helplessly. “What’s the use of being a good fighter? No matter how well a Qi Refinement cultivator can fight, can they block a flying sword? It's not as good as being able to teach a few more classes and earn more money.”

“But Cai Tou is old, and he’s been taking Dao heart buffers for so many years. His memory has been getting worse and worse these past few months, and fewer students were signing up for his classes. His performance wasn't up to par, so naturally, he had to go.”

As she spoke, Che Nu gave a bitter smile. “In the end, whether you’re in a company or a gang, if you don’t get into a university and obtain a Foundation Establishment certificate, isn’t this how everyone ends up? Leaving sooner or later is just a matter of time.”

Watching Che Nu’s dejected figure walk away, Bai Zhenzhen slowly pressed against Zhang Yu from behind and passed the spiritual root to him.

She said with a determined expression, “Yu-boy, we must get into one of the Ten Greats and achieve Foundation Establishment.”

Zhang Yu nodded with equal resolve. “Yeah. I’m going to cultivate first. You have a good class.”

---

In the cafeteria during lunchtime.

Zhao Tianxing watched with envy as Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen shoveled synthetic food into their mouths with gusto.

_I can't believe Zhen and Yu-boy actually made it onto the competition team._

_But the three major high schools have gained so much momentum after getting Oasis Group’s technology._

Zhao Tianxing recalled some recent rumors and looked at Zhang Yu. “Li Yong and Ye Haitao from the competition team are making a scene, demanding a refund. Do you guys know about this?”

“Huh?” Zhang Yu shook his head. “No idea. I haven't been to the team training for the past two weeks.”

Bai Zhenzhen chimed in from the side, “Yeah, I heard them arguing when I went. I think it was about getting their money back.”

Zhao Tianxing lamented, “Sigh, a single strategic move by a behemoth like Oasis Group can unknowingly affect the future of so many families.”

Qian Shen also nodded, his expression grave. “From now on, the three major high schools will monopolize all competitions.”

“But that’s not the scariest part. They’ve already monopolized all the other competitions besides the athletics meet in the past.”

“The scariest part is that with their enhanced body tempering techniques, the top students' physical education scores are bound to soar, and the average scores will rise again.”

“I did the math yesterday. If this continues, with the dual gap in competitions and scores, Songyang High might only have one or two people per graduating class who can get into the top Ten Greats in the future.”

The doll, disguised as prayer beads hanging on Zhang Yu's neck, let out a chuckle in his mind. “The wealthy families of Songyang City are starting to fight among themselves.”

“Heh heh, this is the work of the wealthy families behind the three major high schools. They want to completely monopolize the admission spots to the Ten Greats and squeeze out all the other high schools.”

Zhang Yu was startled. _Infighting among the rich?_

Sensing Zhang Yu’s surprise, the doll chuckled lightly and continued, “Wealth continuously accumulates. The three major high schools get the most admissions to the Ten Greats from Songyang City every year. The families behind them grow stronger and stronger, and their wealth naturally grows much faster than that of the other high schools.”

“Otherwise, how do you think they managed to slowly monopolize the competitions, year after year?”

“The situation in Songyang City is actually considered pretty good.”

“I know of some cities on the first layer of Kunxu where a population of tens of millions is served by only a single key high school.”

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _So we’ve happened to run into the era where the three major high schools are further monopolizing the spots in the Ten Greats?_

Zhang Yu sighed. The longer he stayed in Kunxu, the more weary he felt. It was as if the entire world exerted an invisible pressure, constantly urging him, pushing him to hurry up and run forward.

As the days passed one by one, the day of the sports competition finally arrived.

(End of Chapter)
