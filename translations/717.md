# Chapter 717: Countdown to Shatter the Heaven

In the office, behind each holographic projection, representatives from the Ten Great Universities listened intently to Zhang Yu's words — or at least pretended to.

The reason was simple: Zhang Yu was now unimaginably wealthy.

His mere projected assets radiated a pressure like a raging flood, the endless rows of numbers enough to crush his opponents' spirits. Within the Ten Universities, everyone but him seemed reduced to mere livestock — cattle, horses, sheep — while the Nascent Soul True Monarchs and university representatives before him appeared as nothing more than paupers.

In the small group chat, someone typed: Heavenly Struggle, didn't you say True Monarch Blazing Light misappropriated funds?

True Monarch Heavenly Struggle replied: Even if a Nascent Soul True Monarch like Blazing Light did misappropriate funds, it wouldn't be a matter of violating regulations or laws. The original funding allocation was likely flawed.

Another member chimed in: Precise Attainment, weren't you just advocating for Heavenly Demon University to take over the Research Association?

True Monarch Precise Attainment retorted: Don't twist my words. I meant we should send someone to assist True Monarch Blazing Light in managing the Research Association, allowing him to focus on cultivation without financial worries.

No matter how others tried to provoke them, no one in the Small Group dared to speak up.

The earlier clamor for war and bloodshed had instantly vanished.

Faced with someone who controlled Soul Transformation-level assets, representatives from the Ten Universities like True Monarch Precise Attainment and True Monarch Heavenly Struggle knew they stood no chance of resistance.

While such a Quasi Soul Transformation or Pseudo Soul Transformation expert might struggle to fully leverage their wealth against the Righteous Qi Alliance, in an internal conflict among the Ten Universities, a single financial storm unleashed by them could completely engulf and topple their opponents, leaving them bankrupt.

Kunxu's wealth market operated as a rigid ecosystem. When the wealthy encountered someone even richer and more powerful, they would regard them with utmost respect, listening intently to every word and syllable.

The university representatives were now acting exactly like that.

Yet a question inevitably arose in their minds: How had Zhang Yu acquired such immense wealth?

"Did he obtain it from Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole?"

True Monarch Precise Attainment knew that Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole was renowned for her strict control over assets. Even her Spirit Realm Projection after achieving Soul Transformation often remained a simple four-character inscription.

"But if he can siphon assets directly from Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, that's even more remarkable."

True Monarch Precise Attainment gazed at Zhang Yu with admiration, inwardly musing, "Is it deception? Theft? Or some other method?"

Having cultivated in the Immortal Dao for many years, True Monarch Precise Attainment had witnessed instances of lower-level cultivators defying their superiors.

For example, he had seen a male cultivator from Vocational College engage in dual cultivation with a female cultivator from Joyful Union University, only to later accuse her of illegal forced cultivation and siphon away her assets.

He had also witnessed a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Finance Department defy a Golden Core cultivator from the Civil Engineering Department during the early decline of the civil engineering industry, forcing the latter to kneel and beg for Spirit Coin loans.

But a Nascent Soul cultivator siphoning assets from a Soul Transformation cultivator? This was truly unprecedented.

The more True Monarch Precise Attainment pondered Zhang Yu's methods, the more he sensed an unfathomable depth in the young man before him.

"A Nascent Soul cultivator siphoning assets from a Soul Transformation cultivator... terrifying... truly terrifying. This is far more frightening than those ancient old demons who devoured others' cultivation and Magic Power."

In True Monarch Precise Attainment's eyes, Zhang Yu had transformed into a bottomless black hole. Anyone who approached him risked having their wealth and Immortal Dao potential silently drained away.

Zhang Yu remained oblivious to the thoughts of the university representatives. He simply presented his plan to shatter the firmament, unveiling his design blueprint, showcasing the evidence left by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, and demonstrating a live demonstration.

He held up two Great Void Cloud Repositories and announced, "The Heaven-Piercing Cone I've designed can be purchased as a standalone magical artifact or obtained by upgrading your Great Void Cloud Repository."

"By bypassing the spatial barrier's filtering mechanism, the Heaven-Piercing Cone can penetrate the spatial barriers of both the firmament and space pouches."

As the representatives watched the Great Void Cloud Repository in Zhang Yu's hand transform into a drill, piercing directly into the other Great Void Cloud Repository, their eyes gleamed with realization of the artifact's value and commercial potential.

Discovering Zhang Yu's astonishing Spatial Technology and artifact refinement skills, the representatives' gazes toward him shifted dramatically.

True Monarch Precise Attainment suddenly entertained a wild thought: "Could this person be a reincarnation? Could Magnetic Pole be his hidden hand?"

While the representatives' minds raced with speculation, Zhang Yu began his summary: "The Soul Transformation War has reached its critical juncture."

"Based on the divine light currently observable in the heavens, 38 of our Ten Universities Soul Transformation Experts remain, facing a full-scale assault from 44 enemy Soul Transformation experts. The disparity is immense, and we are at a critical juncture for survival."

"Considering the resources and manpower currently available to the Ten Universities, and accounting for the establishment of production lines, supply chains, raw material transportation, personnel organization, and other factors necessary to complete the Shatter the Heavens mission..."

As Zhang Yu spoke, a countdown timer appeared before his eyes:

15 days, 18 hours, 23 minutes, 39 seconds

"This is the estimated time for completing the Heaven-Shattering Mission, calculated using the combined computational power of Myriad Laws University."

Zhang Yu's expression grew solemn. "Everyone, time is short, and the mission is critical. For Kunxu, for our universities, and most importantly, for our own assets, we must push this plan forward with all our might."

"Furthermore, regarding this plan, I urge you to maintain strict secrecy and refrain from disclosing it to the public for now."

Zhang Yu knew that the plan would inevitably be discovered by the Righteous Qi Alliance, but every moment of secrecy gained was precious.

With Zhang Yu's actions, the Ten Great Universities, like individuals on the brink of death suddenly injected with adrenaline, gradually ramped up their efforts, charging headlong into an unknown future.

---

Heavenly Demon University.

As the Heaven-Piercing Plan progressed, Zhang Yu projected his consciousness through the Spirit Realm, directly transmitting the manufacturing techniques for the Heaven-Piercing Cone and the Great Void Cloud Repository's updated methods for refining it to each university.

In the laboratory, Kuang Tianqing watched Zhang Yu's projection, inwardly astonished. "Indeed, to reach this level so soon after breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage... Zhang Yu truly is a Mighty Reincarnation."

"There's hope! The Ten Great Universities can be saved!"

Ever since recovering his memories, Kuang Tianqing had always considered himself a member of his sect. The current conflict between the Ten Universities and the Righteous Qi Alliance filled him with anguish.

Now, seeing the possibility of the Ten Universities launching a counterattack, he also glimpsed a future where he might return to his sect. He threw himself into his work in the laboratory with renewed fervor.

---

Netherworld University.

Wang Yin stared at Zhang Yu's projection, startled at first, then overjoyed. "Mom! We're coming to save you!"

After losing contact with his Soul Transformation Realm mother, Wang Yin realized that nothing in the world mattered more than his family's safety — not lifelong rivalries, not his complicated history with Zhang Yu, not the technological competition between universities...

"Nothing compares to my mother's well-being."

Whenever he thought of Divine Monarch Nether Spring fighting to the death on the Fifth Layer, her life hanging by a thread, while he hadn't even taken control of her assets, Wang Yin felt a pang of heartache, a wave of fear, and a chilling dread.

At that moment, Wang Yin listened intently to Zhang Yu's teachings, determined to pour every ounce of effort into the Heaven-Piercing Plan.

---

Immortal Armaments University.

Tian Shengong gazed at Zhang Yu's projection, feeling none of his usual jealousy or resentment for the first time.

In recent days, Immortal Armaments University had repeatedly attempted to support the Soul Transformation experts and turn the tide of the war, only to fail each time.

The atmosphere in Tian Shengong's Space Technology Laboratory had grown increasingly oppressive with each failure, and morale was plummeting.

Now, Zhang Yu's arrival with advanced technology felt like the coming of a savior, offering a way to rescue Kunxu, the Ten Universities, and their very lives.

In the days that followed, Tian Shengong noticed that while the university's leaders, high-ranking officials, and wealthy individuals continued to publicly use Extreme Tiger products like their space pouches, they were secretly purchasing Great Void Cloud Repositories.

"Ah, after all, Extreme Tiger is just for work," Tian Shengong murmured, stroking the Great Void Cloud Repository in his pocket. "Defeating the Righteous Qi Alliance, on the other hand, concerns the fate of the world."

---

The highest-level office of the Research Association.

Through the massive floor-to-ceiling windows, Zhang Yu's gaze seemed to pierce through the layers of the sky, focusing on the two divine lights at the highest point of the Fifth Layer — the lights representing Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood.

According to observations, records, and calculations of the divine light's brightness, their intensity had significantly diminished.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole retained only 78% of her peak brightness, while Divine Monarch Greenwood had declined even further, dropping to 65% of his peak.

"By analyzing the brightness of the Soul Transformation Divine Light, we can roughly estimate the remaining power of the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs."

"Teacher Magnetic Pole still has most of her strength left, but Teacher Greenwood is nearing the halfway point."

Zhang Yu then shifted his gaze to the opposite side of the sky, focusing on an incomparably dazzling presence — a radiant entity surrounded by countless stars, constantly emitting a brilliant light.

"Based on observations from various universities, this divine light likely represents the Alliance Leader of the Righteous Qi Alliance."

"Since the start of the war, his divine light's brightness has remained unwavering — consistently at 100% of its peak intensity."

Gazing at this divine light, Zhang Yu could almost visualize the complete suppression and steady retreat of the remaining 38 Soul Transformation experts from the Ten Universities.

"Once the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation Experts are eliminated, the outcome will be decided."

"That's why, after cutting off the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation Experts' supply lines and logistics, the Righteous Qi Alliance concentrated all their Soul Transformation power on the Soul Transformation Battlefield, without even sparing a single Soul Transformation Expert to deal with us."

"In their eyes, we aren't worth wasting Soul Transformation power on."

"They aim to end the Soul Transformation War with maximum force and efficiency."

"We're racing against time, and so are they."

Zhang Yu sighed inwardly, feeling the pressure from the dazzling divine light.

"Can we move even faster?"

Zhang Yu glanced at the countdown: 13 days, 6 hours, 45 minutes, 12 seconds.

Every available resource had already been mobilized. Even his own Heavenly Sun Radiance God, Monsterfolk Avatar, and the sixteen strands of consciousness split from his Immeasurable Heart Inner Dharma Body were working tirelessly to set up production lines, accelerate the production of Heaven-Piercing Cones, and push forward updates to the Great Void Cloud Repository.

Just then, a message arrived.

Feng Tingting: True Monarch! Have you seen what's happening at Celestial Monsters University?

Zhang Yu replied, puzzled: What's going on?

A moment later, Feng Tingting sent a video.

The video showed a female figure with dragon horns and scales, yet retaining a human form.

She spoke, "I am Divine Monarch Great Devourer."

"I hereby announce my official membership in the Righteous Qi Alliance."

Divine Monarch Great Devourer's declaration sent shockwaves through Celestial Monsters University.

Although the university's administration tried desperately to delete the video, without the presence of a Righteous God, they were powerless to stop its spread.

After all, the Righteous God's duties were currently being handled by Soul Cultivators, many of whom not only refused to delete the video but actively shared it themselves.

Zhang Yu's heart sank as he watched. "Those Righteous Qi Alliance bastards... They're unwilling to waste Soul Transformation power on us directly, but they're perfectly willing to wage a propaganda war, using non-Soul Transformation forces to target the Second and Third Layers. By devouring the manpower and resources of the Second and Third Layers, they'll further increase their chances of victory on the Soul Transformation Battlefield and accelerate the war's progress..."

But the Divine Monarch Great Devourer's next words in the video had an even greater impact.

"The Righteous Qi Alliance welcomes all monsters and humans."

The Divine Monarch Great Devourer continued, "The poorer you are, the more welcome you are. Poverty is proof of oppression within the Ten Universities."

"Do you want to be oppressed your whole lives?"

"Don't you want to stomp on the heads of the Ten Greats and make them feel your rage?"

"Borrow money with all your might! Borrow, take out loans, find anything you can take from the Ten Great Universities' territories, then join the Righteous Qi Alliance. You won't have to repay the money — all debts and loans will be completely written off..."

Watching Divine Monarch Great Devourer personally promote taking out microloans and fleeing to the Righteous Qi Alliance, Zhang Yu couldn't help but break into a cold sweat.

Soon, Zhang Yu witnessed countless monsterfolk borrowing money.

Even in his Hometown Group, he saw many monsterfolk graduates from Red Pagoda High School borrowing money, their profile pictures turning gray as they were either directly banned or permanently went offline.

Before long, even monsterfolk who had no intention of fleeing were affected.

Shi Yunxiang complained on his social media: "Why has my credit card limit been reduced this month? I'm not from Celestial Monsters University — I'm a monsterfolk from Myriad Laws University!"

Xiong Wenwu messaged Hu Yuntao: "My medicinal food loan was rejected this month. Yuntao, can you lend me some money?"

As the monsterfolk debt crisis erupted, loan approvals for monsterfolk became increasingly stringent, sparking widespread discontent among the community.

This was particularly devastating for lower-tier monsterfolk, who relied on monthly loans for basic survival. With credit suddenly cut off, they were driven to desperation.

But this was only the beginning.

The surrender of Divine Monarch Great Devourer left the Soul Transformation Certificate process at Celestial Monsters University in a state of chaos. Many Great Monsters on the verge of breaking through to the Soul Transformation Realm were now denied legitimate advancement opportunities.

The following day, a campus of Celestial Monsters University was attacked.

True Monarch Heaven Devourer, a powerful Great Monster, joined forces with five Nascent Soul True Monarchs from the university to seize vast quantities of supplies.

Under the firmament, as the elite university students gnashed their teeth in fury, True Monarch Heaven Devourer roared with laughter. "All Ten Great Universities, remember this! This is just the beginning!"

"There will be more attacks — again, and again, and again! Every monsterfolk beside you, every monsterfolk beneath your feet, every monsterfolk in your mouths — any of them could turn and bite you, making you taste the fear of being devoured!"

Watching True Monarch Heaven Devourer's speech in the video, Zhang Yu cursed inwardly, "Damn Mother Dragon! Damn Heaven Devourer!"

He knew that Divine Monarch Great Devourer's words, combined with True Monarch Heaven Devourer's actions and speech, would inevitably ignite the conflict between humans and monsters within the Ten Great Universities.

The plundering of resources, the eruption of human-monster conflict, the mass rebellion of monsterfolk... all of this would inevitably slow down the progress of the Heaven-Piercing Plan.

Zhang Yu glanced at the Heaven-Piercing Plan countdown, estimated by Myriad Laws University's Spirit Realm computational power. Suddenly, the remaining time surged from 13 days to 15 days, 19 hours, 32 minutes, and 44 seconds.

With the timeline extended, Zhang Yu could only do his utmost to mitigate the human-monster conflict, gritting his teeth as he continued to push forward the Heaven-Piercing Plan.

---

In the office, Bei Wufeng looked at Zhang Yu and said, "True Monarch, I believe we should conduct a thorough screening of all monsterfolk within the Research Association, especially security personnel and those working on construction sites. It would be best to expel them all and replace them with humans."

Bei Wufeng wanted to discuss this face-to-face with Zhang Yu for two reasons: genuine concern about a potential monsterfolk rebellion, and a desire to emulate Yan Qianji by posing various questions and suggestions to Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu frowned. "Wufeng, I understand your concerns about a monsterfolk rebellion, but given the current situation, we can't afford to escalate the conflict between humans and monsters."

Bei Wufeng earnestly argued, "We didn't start this conflict — it already existed! And it will only intensify. If we don't take preventive measures now and instead let it fester, the consequences could be far more severe in the future..."

Zhang Yu sighed. He knew the logic behind Bei Wufeng's words, but according to his own calculations and those of the Spirit Realm Calculation Pool, if he initiated a public screening and expulsion of monsterfolk, countless others would follow suit, exacerbating the conflict.

This would delay the completion of the Heaven-Piercing Plan by at least ten days. Watching the Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood dimming steadily by the hour, Zhang Yu couldn't accept such a loss of time.

Seeing Bei Wufeng still trying to persuade him, Zhang Yu said helplessly, "Public screenings and expulsions are out of the question."

"However, I can assign you a mission: secretly monitor all monsterfolk within and outside the Research Association. Report any suspicious activity to me immediately."

At the construction site, Tu Lishan scrolled through a stream of messages.

Yu Xinghan from the Civil Engineering Department: Teacher, it's been a while! I'm coordinating the factory construction this time. Please guide me.

Tu Lishan: Xinghan, you're becoming increasingly capable. I see you everywhere on these production line expansion projects.

Mo Shangjin from the Artifact Refinement Department: Teacher, please continue to guide me this time as well.

Tu Lishan: Good, good. I trust you'll do well.

Some former students from the Finance Department, who hadn't been recruited by the department's main forces, were also at the construction site looking for work.

"Teacher, do you remember me? Huai Zhixia, who helped you with your loan application..."

Tu Lishan looked at the Finance Department student and shook his head. "My memory isn't what it used to be. I don't remember."

"Teacher..."

Another pixelated figure approached, accompanied by garbled noises. Tu Lishan recognized it as a monsterfolk he had blacklisted, come to confront him.

Despite Zhang Yu's efforts to ease tensions, conflicts between humans and monsters remained inevitable. No amount of propaganda could prevent cultivators, especially high-ranking ones, from growing wary of all monsterfolk.

The Ten Universities' leadership understood that this wariness would only drive more monsterfolk toward the Righteous Qi Alliance. Yet none were willing to gamble their profits and assets on whether the monsterfolk they encountered could be trusted.

---

8 days, 7 hours, 55 minutes, and 12 seconds.

Watching the countdown tick down, Zhang Yu had never felt such an intense desire for time to accelerate, to pass as quickly as possible.

But in the next moment, the countdown suddenly surged, leaping to 11 days, 12 hours, 49 minutes, and 7 seconds.

"What's happened now?"

Zhang Yu immediately checked various news sources.

He saw videos of Flying Boats descending upon a vocational college, transporting all the students and faculty to the firmament above.

True Monarch Junior College stood at the bow of one of the ships, smiling as he addressed the crowd: "Everyone, do you want to be university students? Do you want to break free from the shackles of being a junior college student?"

"The Righteous Qi Alliance declares that from this day forward, there will be no more junior college students — only university students!"

"Join the Righteous Qi Alliance, and the college entrance exam will no longer divide you. From now on, everyone will be a university student! There will be no more junior college students in the world!"

"Join the Righteous Qi Alliance, and you can choose any military-grade cultivation technique for free! Study for a year, and we'll even teach you Immortal Sect Techniques!"

"Join the Righteous Qi Alliance..."

True Monarch Junior College continued, smiling as he lifted the corpse of a Nascent Soul Cultivator: "Look, this guy was apparently the Ten Great League Champion from over thirty years ago."

"Join the Righteous Qi Alliance, and you too can crush these so-called Heavenly Chosen of the Ten Universities beneath your feet, just like I do."

Watching the video, Zhang Yu sighed inwardly. "These guys... offering free military-grade education? Even teaching Immortal Sect Techniques? This is insane propaganda."

Following True Monarch Junior College's video, True Monarch Calculated Deduction of the Righteous Qi Alliance released his own, which quickly went viral across the Spirit Realm.

In the video, True Monarch Calculated Deduction began explaining the Righteous Qi Alliance's hierarchy of contempt for newcomers.

Every member of the Righteous Qi Alliance was marked with their join date. Those who joined earlier were naturally more respected, regardless of their cultivation realm — they were considered seniors.

Conversely, those who joined later were subjected to contempt, even if their cultivation realm was higher. They were considered juniors, forced to yield their place in queues, wait for medicine, and receive weaker benefits...

Watching the frenzied propaganda of True Monarch Junior College and True Monarch Calculated Deduction, Zhang Yu could almost see countless Junior College Students stirring with ambition.

Clearly, this relentless wave of propaganda would once again strike a blow against the Ten Great Universities and the already faltering Heaven-Piercing Plan.

Lady Fortune suddenly remarked, "Their recent actions seem to completely disregard long-term sustainability. It gives me a sense of... madness."

Zhang Yu's heart stirred, and he nodded slightly. "These guys are indeed becoming increasingly reckless."

Regardless of the Righteous Qi Alliance's reasons for their escalating madness, Zhang Yu could feel the immense pressure this recklessness was placing on the Ten Universities.

Like the other True Monarchs, he could only fully support the suppression of related information, striving to minimize its circulation.

Feng Tingting: "True Monarch, could you please lift my ban? [Pleading face emoji]"

Feng Tingting: "I was clearly talking about True Monarch Great Profit, the legitimate Nascent Soul True Monarch from Immortal Armaments University! Yet I was wrongly banned for 24 hours!"

Feng Tingting: "I'm the one exposing the Righteous Qi Alliance's dark secrets! Now that I'm silenced, who knows how many trolls will seize this opportunity to promote the Alliance's propaganda!"

Zhang Yu: "I've inquired about it. The ban should be lifted soon."

Zhang Yu: "Recent information censorship has been particularly strict. The Righteous Qi Alliance has been using "True Monarch Great Profit" as a homophone for "True Monarch Junior College" to spread their propaganda. True Monarch Great Profit himself has already applied to change his Dao Title. You should be careful too."

---

At the construction site, after receiving guidance from Zhang Yu, Yan Qianji traveled to various sites to oversee the construction of production lines.

At that moment, Zhao Tianxing's floating figure appeared in Yan Qianji's bionic eye. Yan Qianji turned to his assistant and said, "Didn't I say no vocational college graduates on my construction sites? Have you not seen how many junior college students are causing trouble every day? This project concerns True Monarch Blazing Light's grand plan. Can you bear the responsibility if something goes wrong?"

His assistant replied helplessly, "This College Soul Cultivator has already upgraded to a bachelor's degree program, and he's one of True Monarch Blazing Light's people."

Zhao Tianxing looked at Yan Qianji and said, "I also broke through to the Foundation Establishment Stage in the Spirit Realm Calculation Pool at Myriad Laws University. I'm not just an ordinary junior college student — you could consider me half an alumnus."

As he spoke, he showed proof of his access to the Research Association.

Seeing this evidence only deepened Yan Qianji's dissatisfaction. That very day, he reported to Zhang Yu: "True Monarch, it's said, 'Universities are for the elite, vocational colleges for the masses.' With junior college students causing trouble so frequently these days, how can you allow them free access to the Research Association? The security risks are far too great."

Zhang Yu sighed and glanced at Jin Jun's report accusing Shi Yunxiang of stealing materials from the construction site, hoping for a thorough investigation of the monsterfolk.

But Zhang Yu knew that if he truly punished Shi Yunxiang severely, the numerous monsterfolk within the Ten Universities wouldn't care about the truth; they would simply see it as targeting their kind.

Research was one thing, but now that this conflict had erupted, it would delay the Heaven-Piercing Plan by at least eighteen hours.

Moreover, scavenging materials from construction sites was a tacitly accepted practice among the universities — Zhang Yu himself had done it many times in the past.

Punishing Shi Yunxiang for this would likely provoke a backlash from the Civil Engineering Department, further jeopardizing the Heaven-Piercing Plan.

Just as Zhang Yu was pondering how to proceed, he received another report detailing True Monarch String Tone and True Monarch Thunder Pole's embezzlement. The two had been taking kickbacks from external vendors.

Investigating this matter thoroughly would also delay the Heaven-Piercing Plan's completion.

Furthermore, as lending platforms tightened their restrictions on monsterfolk and Junior College Students, famine and medicine shortages began to spread among these groups.

But now, with the Ten Universities fully committed to the Heaven-Piercing Plan, offering aid to the Junior College Students and monsterfolk would not only lack support from the university leadership but would also inevitably delay the plan.

Zhang Yu found himself caught in an unrelenting vise of pressure from the Righteous Qi Alliance. Every problem that surfaced before him, every choice he could make, forced him to either betray his conscience or jeopardize the greater good.

Even with his elevated status and enhanced power, he seemed to face even greater pressure and more vexing dilemmas.

He felt like a taut string, desperately pulling the Ten Great Universities forward as he watched the countdown tick relentlessly onward.

5 days 12 hours 3 minutes 27 seconds

On this day, Xiong Wenwu's avatar began to flash before Zhang Yu.

But when Zhang Yu answered the call, an unfamiliar projection appeared instead, hovering before him.

The stranger looked at Zhang Yu and said, "Greetings, Zhang Yu."

"I am Fu Xiantian, Alliance Leader of the Righteous Qi Alliance."

"You may call me Senior Brother."
