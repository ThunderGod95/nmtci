# Chapter 775: Adaptability Assessment

Looking at the Celestial Inquiry Star's response, Chen Xingxuan nodded in satisfaction. He no longer considered Zhang Yu and Shen Qingyun worthy of his attention.

Ever since he started using the Celestial Inquiry Star's High-Intelligence Spirit Artifact service, the artifact spirit had consistently gathered data and made judgments with remarkable efficiency.

Most of the questions he posed were met with detailed and useful answers.

Unconsciously, Chen Xingxuan had developed a routine: consulting the Celestial Inquiry Star before starting his workday, during his cultivation sessions, and whenever he encountered difficulties.

He even found himself asking it about trivial daily matters. Each time he gained something valuable, his reliance on the High-Intelligence Spirit Artifact grew stronger.

"The only downside is that my Celestial Inquiry Star service level is too low."

Chen Xingxuan knew that the Celestial Inquiry Star, a High-Intelligence Spirit Artifact developed by the Myriad Laws Sect's upper echelons, had been answering countless cultivators' questions every moment since its official launch.

Only by spending more money to attain a higher service level could he enable the Celestial Inquiry Star to allocate more resources to his inquiries.

"The more you spend, the higher your level, and the greater the Celestial Inquiry Star's accuracy. It considers problems more deeply and utilizes a broader, more detailed range of data."

Chen Xingxuan had already made up his mind.

"Once High-Intelligence Spirit Artifact technology has its breakthrough, the future will be a new dimension for all cultivators."

"To advance further on the Immortal Dao, possessing a High-Intelligence Spirit Artifact is essential."

"If I can become the Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One this time, with the promotion and salary increase, I'll immediately upgrade my Celestial Inquiry Star's service level."

These thoughts flashed through Chen Xingxuan's mind like lightning. He then turned his attention to the final candidate, besides Zhang Yu and Shen Qingyun.

"Celestial Inquiry Star, how does this person compare to me?"

"Your exclusive artifact spirit, the Celestial Inquiry Star, is now thinking for you."

"The Master's tone is more solemn than with the previous two, and his observation period is longer. He clearly considers this target very important. I should gather more detailed data for my judgment..."

Countless streams of thought flickered rapidly. The next moment, the Celestial Inquiry Star replied: "Yu Qingrang, from Daoist Arts Group One of the Review Department. She is the fifth-generation descendant and dual cultivation partner of Luo Wuji, the Minister of the Review Department."

"According to publicly available data from the Dual Cultivation Support Department, Yu Qingrang has ranked first for consecutive years in the number of cultivation sessions among Luo Wuji's registered dual cultivation partners."

Chen Xingxuan nodded slightly. He already knew this information and felt a twinge of envy toward Yu Qingrang's background.

"While dual cultivating with one's own bloodline descendant eliminates the risk of bloodline information leakage, not to mention worries about pregnancy or being scammed for child support, finding a superior Cauldron among one's descendants... is no easy task."

Chen Xingxuan thought to himself, "After all, the number of bloodline descendants is minuscule compared to the vast population of Lower Cultivators. The pool of superior talent is far, far smaller."

"Especially as times change, Upper Cultivators have fewer and fewer descendants. Someone like Yu Qingrang was born over a century ago."

But Chen Xingxuan also knew that while few descendants of Upper Cultivators rose to prominence, those who did often possessed numerous advantages.

For instance, being a trusted dual cultivation Cauldron for their ancestors was an advantage that non-bloodline cultivators could never match.

Furthermore, her position in Daoist Arts Group One was a testament to Yu Qingrang's strength.

"But how can a member of the Daoist Arts Group compete for the Group Leader position of Martial Dao Group One?"

Just as Chen Xingxuan pondered this, the Celestial Inquiry Star's next words answered his question.

"According to numerous cultivation transaction records, Yu Qingrang sold most of her Daoist Arts cultivation to purchase Martial Dao cultivation."

"Her Bionics alone have download records for hundreds of cultivation arts, covering nearly every major category of the Martial Dao."

"Based on her employee records, she has hired at least seven Nascent Soul Realm Soul Cultivators skilled in Martial Dao techniques within the last month, who now permanently reside in her Sea of Consciousness."

The continuous stream of data highlighted Yu Qingrang's formidable nature, especially the immense effort she had invested in transitioning to the Martial Dao.

"This woman... she converted all her Daoist Arts cultivation into Martial Dao cultivation?"

Chen Xingxuan thought grimly, "Is it because the Daoist Arts Group Leaders have such long lifespans that she saw no hope for promotion and decided to switch paths just to snatch a position in our Martial Dao Group? Yu Qingrang... that Daoist thief! How can Martial Dao Group One be entrusted to someone like her?"

As the Celestial Inquiry Star presented the data, a Spiritual Energy Diagram materialized before Chen Xingxuan.

The diagram displayed traces of intense spiritual energy consumption. Areas filled with red indicated where spiritual energy was being consumed most fiercely.

On the diagram, Yu Qingrang's figure was so red it appeared almost black.

Chen Xingxuan asked, "What is this?"

Celestial Inquiry Star: "This is a Spiritual Energy Consumption Diagram. According to the detection data from your Bionics, Yu Qingrang consumes more spiritual energy per minute than you and the other two contestants combined."

Chen Xingxuan took a deep breath. The constant, massive consumption of spiritual energy meant that a vast number of systems were running simultaneously. He knew this was because of Yu Qingrang's Bionics, the Soul Cultivators she employed, her cultivation arts... the sheer number of things she had operating at once.

From this alone, Chen Xingxuan could grasp just how powerful she was.

At the same time, a message appeared in Yu Qingrang's vision: "Your data is being leaked. Block?"

Yu Qingrang pointed a finger, and with an infusion of Immortal Coins, an invisible wave erupted from her body.

The next moment, Chen Xingxuan saw the Celestial Inquiry Star's analysis halt.

"Do I need to pay more?"

Chen Xingxuan shook his head. If he forcefully spent Immortal Coins to unlock her data now, it would likely escalate into a direct contest of Immortal Coin reserves between them.

He knew that this kind of Immortal Coin competition was somewhat like... the Magic Power Competitions of the past.

But while a Magic Power Competition was simply a matter of who ran out of magic power first, a contest of Immortal Coins was far more perilous.

At the same time, his gaze shifted to Yu Qingrang, meeting hers in a fierce clash that seemed to ignite sparks of gunpowder in the air.

In that moment, the two locked gazes, each recognizing the other as their greatest rival for the day, a serious threat to their bid for the Third Rank.

Meanwhile, in a space invisible to the four candidates, the arbitrators of this Adaptability Assessment were observing the scene. They were not responsible for scoring or selecting the winner; their role was purely supervisory, projecting themselves here to oversee the entire process.

Among them were Luo Wuji, Minister of the Review Department, and his deputies, Lu Hengzhang and Gu Qingya.

When Gu Qingya saw Chen Xingxuan and Yu Qingrang appear, his brow furrowed slightly. He understood that the competition this time would indeed be fierce.

He thought to himself, "After all, the number of Level 2 Sect Staff who have accumulated years of experience is growing, while the number of vacant positions above them is shrinking. In the past... with Chen Xingxuan and Yu Qingrang's qualifications and skill, they would have been directly promoted to Group Leader without any issue. Why would they need to compete like this?"

"If Zhang Yu loses to them, it would be entirely normal."

"At worst, I'll just provide him with extra guidance later to broaden his immortal path. That should compensate for his efforts this time."

Meanwhile, Luo Wuji watched the four candidates and thought, "Qingrang's greatest threat is Chen Xingxuan."

"Zhang Yu might be a distant second, at best."

Luo Wuji's gaze turned slightly cold when he saw Zhang Yu.

He had long since lost any admiration for this disobedient member of the Martial Dao Group. Zhang Yu's decision to submit his materials to Gu Qingya this time had particularly displeased Luo Wuji, even making him regret promoting Zhang Yu to the 2nd Rank in the first place.

"I promoted you, yet you remain so insubordinate. Truly a disobedient individual, not worth investing in."

Meanwhile, Lu Hengzhang watched the four candidates, silently hoping that neither Zhang Yu nor Yu Qingrang would secure a promotion.

The former was a Lower Realm Native whom he despised, while the latter was Luo Wuji's descendant. He wanted neither of them to advance.

"Zhang Yu's chances are slim, though. His foundation is still too shallow."

"But this Yu Qingrang... it won't be easy for Chen Xingxuan to defeat her."

As the observers' thoughts diverged, the Adaptability Assessment officially began. A series of rules materialized before the candidates.

Zhang Yu read the rules and thought, "Select a martial dao technique from the Assessment Center's provided library and simulate it."

"We have five minutes to familiarize ourselves with the technique and practice the simulation."

"Then... we must apply these techniques to complete work tasks."

Meanwhile, lists of cultivation arts had already appeared before everyone, and Chen Xingxuan and Yu Qingrang quickly began making their selections.

After a quick scan, Zhang Yu discovered that the highest-level techniques in the Assessment Center's library were only expert-grade.

"The tasks we need to solve with these techniques are..."

Zhang Yu's gaze shifted to the task list, and he mentally summarized the contents. "Simply put... transportation, archaeology, and factory work?"

As he examined the specific requirements for the three tasks, Zhang Yu began to consider which techniques he should choose.

He asked inwardly, "Immortal Slayer, what would you pick?"

Luo Wuji thought to himself, "The Adaptability Assessment is designed to test a candidate's professional competence in their role."

"What abilities does the Martial Dao Group Leader need?"

"Review skills are a given; even ordinary members need those."

"Next is judgment: the ability to quickly assess a technique's applications, usage direction, and value. This is crucial for efficient task allocation."

"So... this assessment forces candidates to select suitable techniques based on the tasks at hand. It tests both their ability to simulate techniques and their eye for discerning a technique's true worth."

As the Arbitrators' minds raced, some candidates had already finished their selections.

With the aid of the Celestial Inquiry Star, Chen Xingxuan was the first to complete his choices, selecting three techniques in record time.

Lu Hengzhang nodded slightly. "Chen Xingxuan finished first. Three tasks, three techniques, each one perfectly suited. A textbook answer."

Gu Qingya glanced at Yu Qingrang, who had finished second. He thought, "She picked five techniques at once? And two of them are mental cultivation techniques? That's bold... Does she really think she can simulate all five techniques, including the two mental ones, to level 40 within five minutes?"

"According to the rules, every technique selected must be used in the tasks. If she picks one and doesn't use it, or if it hinders her performance, her evaluation will actually be lower."

Just as Gu Qingya was thinking Yu Qingrang had chosen too many, Zhang Yu also finalized his selection, grabbing seven techniques in one go.

Seeing this, Gu Qingya frowned. "What's that kid doing picking so many techniques? This isn't a contest to see who can grab the most... With only five minutes of preparation, what level could he possibly simulate them to?"

After Chen Xingxuan, Yu Qingrang, and Zhang Yu finished their selections one after another, Shen Qingyun grew slightly nervous. After agonizing over her choices until the last moment, she finally decided on the three techniques she would use.

With the technique selection complete, a five-minute countdown began.

During these five minutes, the four candidates had to quickly familiarize themselves with their chosen techniques in preparation for the upcoming tasks.

Just as everyone started studying, a whistling sound echoed through the air. Chen Xingxuan, while reading the technique descriptions, activated his Formless Martial Art and began simulating the techniques.

Level 30... Level 33... Level 40!

With each move, he simulated the effects of the martial dao techniques at an astonishing speed.

"As expected of an elite from the Mental Cultivation Group who has broken through to Martial Twenty. His learning speed is remarkable." Luo Wuji nodded slightly, then turned his gaze to Yu Qingrang.

"But compared to my bloodline descendant..."

The next moment, with a wave of her hand, Yu Qingrang successfully simulated each martial art to level 40, then spent the majority of her remaining time on the mental cultivation techniques.

Her speed was possible only because she had downloaded the memories of various expert-grade martial dao techniques before the exam even began.

Drawing on this stored knowledge, she activated her Formless Martial Art to simulate the techniques. The process was effortless, as if she were practicing arts she had cultivated for years.

Gu Qingya watched Yu Qingrang, thinking to himself, "Yu Qingrang is just a reviewer from the Daoist Arts Group, yet her simulation speed surpasses even Chen Xingxuan's? Luo Wuji must have given her significant support."

He then turned his attention to Zhang Yu, only to find him sitting cross-legged, showing no intention of simulating any techniques at all.

"What is that kid doing?"

Zhang Yu was meticulously reading the texts of the seven techniques he had chosen, committing every word to memory. Once he finished reading, he knew, without any need for practice, that he could successfully simulate all seven.

Zhang Yu understood this was the power of his Chain Formation Diagram's Formless Martial Art. Born from his astonishing talent and potential, it possessed incredible might, allowing him to instantly simulate techniques to level 40 with 50% of their full power just by reading their descriptions.

He thought to himself, "Once I cultivate Martial Eleven, Martial Twelve, and more techniques belonging to the Formless Martial Art, the Chain Formation Diagram's effects will grow even stronger. I wonder just how powerful it will become then."

To Gu Qingya, however, Zhang Yu's stillness suggested he was struggling to simulate the techniques and hadn't even made a single attempt.

"That kid... why isn't he even practicing once?"

As Gu Qingya watched in confusion, the four candidates were transported to a simulated work environment to begin their first task: transportation.

Chen Xingxuan summoned a gust of Profound Magnetic Gang Qi, using its repulsive force to lift the cargo and send it toward the target location.

Lu Hengzhang nodded slightly at the sight, thinking, "Using pure expert-grade martial dao techniques for work is a rather primitive approach. Relying on Gang Qi for transportation under these conditions is still an efficient method."

But just then, Yu Qingrang let out a thunderous roar. Her body swelled dramatically, transforming her into a giant. She swallowed the cargo piece by piece, then charged toward the target location.

Luo Wuji nodded in satisfaction at the sight. "Gang Qi is too slow. In terms of speed, it can't compare to a direct physical charge."

"But simulating a body transformation technique requires extreme control over the physical body. Fortunately, under my tutelage, Qingrang's body refinement cultivation is very high, so simulating this technique is now effortless for her."

At the same time, Luo Wuji's gaze shifted to Zhang Yu. He recalled how quickly the boy had mastered the Body Refinement Technique during the interview, knowing that his control over his physical body was equally astonishing.

Just then, Zhang Yu's body swelled abruptly, transforming him into a towering giant, no less imposing than Yu Qingrang.

Luo Wuji thought, "It seems the first work task won't be enough to create a gap between him and the others."

As this thought crossed his mind, Zhang Yu let out a long roar and, to Luo Wuji's surprise, also simulated waves of Gang Qi, sweeping up even more cargo and sending it flying.

Gu Qingya's eyes lit up with admiration. "He simulated and activated two techniques at once? And both reached the peak of Level 40?"

With the conclusion of the first work task, the way Yu Qingrang and Chen Xingxuan looked at Zhang Yu had changed.

Chen Xingxuan turned to Celestial Inquiry Star and said, "What's going on? Didn't you say this Zhang Yu wasn't worth mentioning? How could your judgment be so wrong?"

Celestial Inquiry Star: "You are correct. I did indeed make an error in my previous assessment. However, based on Zhang Yu's operational data, the number of techniques he can simulate and master within five minutes is definitely limited. These two techniques have likely consumed most of his energy. His current excellence signifies a disadvantage in the tasks to come."

Celestial Inquiry Star: "Please relax and maintain your optimal state for the subsequent tasks. Victory will surely be yours."

Meanwhile, Yu Qingrang also stared at Zhang Yu, thinking, "This guy... is more of a threat than I expected. In the next two tasks... I must completely crush him."

Shen Qingyun watched the three of them, inwardly shocked. "I thought my usual dominance over the three Martial Dao Groups already placed me at the top tier. But compared to them... I'm still far behind. In terms of martial dao power alone, I can only push to 40% efficiency, while they've all reached 50%."

"Especially Zhang Yu... to simulate two cultivation arts simultaneously in such a short time? Just how profound is his understanding of martial arts? How quickly can he master these techniques?"

Thinking this, Shen Qingyun felt a wave of despondency, feeling as if the ongoing assessment no longer concerned her.

Soon, the four candidates arrived at another simulated work area: a mock archaeological site.

Observing the scene, Gu Qingya thought, "This archaeological task is about containment and preservation. These are crucial aspects of any dig site, especially for highly confidential locations, particularly those involving lost sects."

"It's not just for secrecy. As times have changed, the current Immortal Dao environment is vastly different from the past. Many artifacts from ancient times, once unearthed and exposed to today's environment... might simply disintegrate."

"The key to this work task is how they use their chosen Expert-Grade Techniques to seal off the site."

As Gu Qingya pondered, the candidates on-site had already begun to act.

"Chen Xingxuan chose freezing? A Level 40 Freezing Technique... quite effective indeed."

Just as Gu Qingya was thinking this, the ground beneath Yu Qingrang on the other side suddenly trembled.

The earth churned and the air howled as the entire archaeological site was completely sealed into a vacuum.

Gu Qingya's heart stirred as he watched. "Not just Level 40, but two Level 40 techniques pushed out simultaneously. One to manipulate the earth, the other to control airflow, instantly creating a vacuum."

"I didn't expect that besides Zhang Yu, this Yu Qingrang could also simulate two martial dao techniques at once in such a short time."

"These Lower Cultivators nowadays... each one is more ruthless than the last. I'm afraid even some of the Martial Dao Review Group Leaders can't compare to them."

On the other side, Luo Wuji thought, "In this work task, Qingrang's performance should be the best..."

Just as this thought crossed his mind, he noticed that Zhang Yu, on the other side, hadn't moved at all. The work environment before him appeared completely unchanged.

"No... that's not right." Luo Wuji's gaze shifted as he thought, "It's not that there's no change, but that the change has already finished. The entire site is enveloped in a stasis field, and all matter has been frozen in stillness."

"How did he do that?"

Even Luo Wuji was astonished. "This effect is nearing military-grade standards. Is this something an Expert-Grade Technique can achieve?"

With a flash of thought, the complete list of techniques from the library appeared in Luo Wuji's mind.

He couldn't recall any single technique capable of producing such an effect.

But Luo Wuji was, after all, the Minister of the Review Department. He quickly identified the anomaly.

"It's Cloud Sea Breath and Celestial Soul Freeze. Zhang Yu activated both techniques simultaneously... then fused their effects. The combination of the two types of qi... actually formed a stasis field?"

"Two Expert-Grade martial arts, fused and executed in his hands, have been pushed to a level approaching military-grade?"
