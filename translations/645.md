# Chapter 645: Even Being Forced into Overtime Would Be Worth It Just to Witness This Live

Watching Tian Shengong unleash a series of battle arts, Zhang Yu realized that his performances in the Ten Greats League had likely been meticulously studied by Tian Shengong countless times. Based on this analysis, Tian Shengong had devised a targeted strategy to completely suppress all of Zhang Yu's abilities in this battle.

"A formidable and utterly repulsive tactic."

"But perhaps only a competitor like Tian Shengong, backed by his company's advanced artifact refinement technology and vast knowledge of Immortal Dao techniques, could execute such a strategy."

"Yet the Extreme Tiger that makes you strong will also be your downfall."

"Tian Shengong, by confronting me head-on with the power of Extreme Tiger, you've trapped yourself in a battlefield where retreat is impossible and failure unthinkable."

"In this battle, Extreme Tiger is both your greatest asset and your heaviest burden."

"And language itself has become a battlefield. Every word you utter, every statement you make, can sway public opinion and market sentiment, forcing you to adapt your battle tactics."

A lightning-fast stream of thoughts flashed through Zhang Yu's mind. In the next instant, he turned to Tian Shengong, and a thunderous wave of sound erupted from his mouth, rolling outward in all directions.

"Tian Shengong, your Extreme Tiger Battle Art is indeed formidable, especially when your strength completely overwhelms your opponent. You could likely crush any enemy with ease."

"But are you truly certain your strength surpasses mine?"

Zhang Yu formed a sword art with his hand, and the twenty-four Great Wu Sacred Law Flying Swords, each radiating brilliant sword light, began to orbit around him.

"Formations, Sea-Filling, Sword Realm, High Temperature, Gravity... You've deliberately entered the domains where I excel."

"You're... courting death."

As he spoke, golden flames of Gang Qi surged from Zhang Yu's body.

"Mountain-Moving Warriors! Emerge!"

With a burst of Gang Qi, twenty-four streams of energy shot forth, infusing the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords. The swords transformed into twenty-four golden humanoid avatars, each radiating divine power.

Forged from Gang Qi infused with the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill and empowered by the twenty-four Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords, these Mountain-Moving Warriors represented Zhang Yu's latest iteration of Gang Qi avatars.

"Tian Shengong, if you want to break my formation, you'll have to compete with me in construction efficiency!"

As he spoke, the 24 Mountain-Moving Warriors materialized, their forms flickering briefly before they shot forward like lightning bolts, plunging into the earth.

Zhang Yu knew that since Tian Shengong had just showcased a series of products and advertisements, he couldn't refuse a direct competition, nor could he back down from a performance comparison in his own field.

With a thunderous roar, the 24 Mountain-Moving Warriors charged forward like colossal beasts, carving through mountains and splitting the earth as they began construction. In the blink of an eye, foundations were completed.

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu projected data from his Bionic Eye: 380 cubic meters per minute.

Rows of projected text lit up behind Zhang Yu: "Come on, Tian Shengong! Today, I'll face your Extreme Tiger Puppet head-on. We'll both construct the same formation and see whose performance is superior!"

Seeing Zhang Yu's challenge, Tian Shengong knew he couldn't refuse.

His gaze sharpened, and he let out a cold snort. Behind him, a vast projection of Spirit Realm Script materialized: "Zhang Yu, let's compete then!"

"Let's see which is superior: your so-called high-end Bionic's performance or my Extreme Tiger products!"

"Extreme Tiger Puppet: Tireless Walker! Born for construction! The most cost-effective construction puppet in the University Realm! Prepare to witness its limits!"

As Tian Shengong channeled vast amounts of Magic Power into the Tireless Walker puppets, they surged into a frenzy.

Tian Shengong projected data from his Bionic Eye: 370 cubic meters per minute.

But the moment he pushed the puppets further, the data surged again, prompting Zhang Yu to activate his sword formation and accelerate his own construction efficiency.

The battlefield erupted in thunderous roars as the two construction teams clashed fiercely from the start, their data constantly vying for dominance. The audience roared with excitement, captivated by the intense competition.

Mo Shangjin watched the spectacle, thinking, "Such a pinnacle Civil Engineering duel unfolding in the Ten Greats League... Civil Engineering is truly blessed."

Xiang Shan, working overtime at Celestial Monsters University, glanced at the competition and exclaimed, "This clash of titans is beyond peak performance! Even being stuck here for free overtime would be worth it just to witness this live!"

While Zhang Yu and Tian Shengong were locked in their construction duel, other arenas were ablaze with competition.

From the surging torrents summoned by the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, four white dragons roared skyward, unleashing waves that crashed against the encroaching mud and sand.

Zhang Yu bellowed, "Tian Shengong, let's test our mastery of the Dao of Transportation!"

"Today, we'll see whether your earth rises an inch higher, or my water surges ten feet higher!"

A colossal torrent erupted skyward, drawing vast quantities of water vapor from all directions to reinforce the artificial flood created by the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor.

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu's projected data materialized above the flood: 400 tons transported per second.

Tian Shengong refused to be outdone, roaring, "Transportation is the foundation of the Immortal Dao! Extreme Tiger has devoted himself to mastering this fundamental principle for a decade, relentlessly refining its core capabilities to meet the most extreme demands, the harshest environments, and the most impossible tasks!"

"With such a performance monster created, who can possibly stop it? Who the hell can stop it now?!"

The Giant Puppet beneath his feet unleashed a devastating aerial strike, shattering entire swaths of mountain rock into a storm of dust and debris that surged across the battlefield.

"Extreme Tiger Earth Fiend Module! Blast it to pieces!"

A deafening explosion erupted as the torrent of debris collided with the opposing force. Tian Shengong projected a data stream: 420 tons transported per second.

First, construction; then, transportation. The ensuing communication battle was naturally not overlooked by either side.

Zhang Yu deployed the 24 Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords embedded within the Mountain-Moving Warrior, their Sword Realm expanding to dominate the battlefield, seeking to monopolize the Spirit Realm.

Behind Zhang Yu, Spirit Realm Script materialized: "Tian Shengong! Can you feel it? Do you sense it? This is the pinnacle of my Myriad Laws' communication technology, the absolute dominion of the Sword Realm! Extreme Tiger's signal is inferior! Inferior! Inferior!"

Sword Realm Communication Efficiency: 120 scrolls per second

Simultaneously, the Spirit Realm signal within the Giant Puppet surged violently, as if a colossal hand were forcibly prying open the compressed Spirit Realm, establishing a counterforce against the Sword Realm.

Tian Shengong declared firmly, "Zhang Yu, you're right. The Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation is the culmination of the Myriad Laws University's Artifact Refinement Department's efforts. This sword formation, composed of twenty-four Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords, can even suppress the Spirit Realm itself."

"But the communication technology I learned from the Extreme Tiger Group allows me to maintain signal dominance even under these conditions!"

"A communication efficiency of 125 scrolls per second! That's the true power of Extreme Tiger!"

Watching this unfold, Bei Wufeng seethed with anger, frustration, and regret. "This isn't how the sword formation should be used! Its aura has been tainted by Zhang Yu's hybrid Demon Beasts. Otherwise, how could my Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords possibly lag behind Extreme Tiger's communication speed?!"

Meanwhile, on the battlefield, twelve spheres surrounding the Giant Puppet erupted with visible waves of energy, blasting outward across the entire arena.

Faced with Zhang Yu's relentless challenges, Tian Shengong launched a direct counterattack.

"Zhang Yu! You're relying on the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to manipulate the battlefield."

"Then let's see whether your Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power's output is greater, or the power of my Extreme Tiger's Dual Polarity Primordial Magnetic Pearls is stronger!"

Behind Tian Shengong, a new set of data materialized: Power Output: 3,200 tons.

Zhang Yu took a deep breath and activated his own Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. Behind him, the display showed: Power Output: 3,350 tons.

Amidst thunderous explosions, an invisible shockwave swept across the arena as the Earthly Fiend Gravity forces clashed and collided, creating a chaotic maelstrom.

The power output of both sides continued to surge, relentlessly pushing toward their respective performance limits.

Simultaneously, Tian Shengong maneuvered his Giant Puppet into battle against the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

High Temperature Resistance: 4500 degrees Celsius!

Construction Efficiency, Transportation Efficiency, Communication Speed, Maximum Power Output, Temperature...

As the two sides traded blows, a world-shaking battle unfolded before countless spectators.

Fans, students, schools, and companies alike frantically captured screenshots of the displayed data, sparking widespread debate across the Spirit Realm.

"Extreme Tiger is too strong! These specs? This performance? And it's selling for so cheap? How can any other company compete?"

"A student's creation is outperforming a corporate product? Extreme Tiger's products are utterly worthless."

"They're just warming up! Neither side has reached their true limits yet. This isn't Tian Shengong's full power!"

Just then, the tide of battle seemed to shift.

Tian Shengong thought to himself, "We're evenly matched in all five areas for now. But once we gain an advantage in one, the others will follow easily."

"To break the balance, I must first secure a victory."

"And that victory will be..."

Memories flooded Tian Shengong's mind, surprisingly vivid recollections of the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor.

In those memories, he felt as if he had personally participated in the armor's design and various experiments, his mind still retaining the relevant data.

Before he could ponder the reason behind this sudden influx of knowledge, Tian Shengong's entire focus had already shifted to the battlefield.

His gaze sharpened as he channeled more Magic Power into the Sea-Filling technique.

"The Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor's method of transporting and gathering atmospheric moisture follows a pattern."

"After all, the amount of moisture within a given space is finite. To sustain long-term transportation, the armor must rotate its transport direction according to a specific rhythm, allowing time for the atmosphere to replenish its moisture... and that's where the weakness lies."

"By disrupting the moisture replenishment, I can cut off his water supply."

With a thunderous roar, Tian Shengong altered the direction of the earth and stone reinforcements. The atmospheric moisture flow immediately faltered, causing Zhang Yu's transportation data to plummet.

As the Sea-Filling technique faltered, Zhang Yu's performance in the other areas seemed to suffer as well, leading to a series of setbacks.

Watching this unfold, Tian Shengong smiled faintly, already resolved to unleash his signature move.
