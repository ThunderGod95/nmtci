# Chapter 495: Reimbursement and Preparing to Transfer Departments

Power Dantian temperature critically high...

Left arm third Vibration Joint fractured...

Spiritual energy circuit short-circuit warning...

As the stream of warning messages flashed across his vision, Wan Gouxuan realized the Earth Surge God had sustained significant damage during his clash with Zhang Yu.

Below the statistical data, the estimated repair cost was listed: 18.23 Spirit Coins.

Under normal circumstances, Wan Gouxuan would likely have been contemplating how to surrender with the most flair. After all, continuing the fight would only drive up the repair costs, making it a losing proposition.

But now, with full reimbursement guaranteed, he felt no fear.

In fact, as the estimated repair cost continued to climb, his fighting spirit only intensified. He yearned to continue the battle and fight to his heart's content!

"Bring it on!"

Activating the Earth Surge God at full power once more, Wan Gouxuan replayed Zhang Yu's astonishing strike in his mind.

"If the Earth Surge God is damaged, I refuse to believe your physical body is unscathed."

"How many more of those attacks can you unleash?"

With a thunderous roar, the Earth Surge God's Power Dantian roared to life, unleashing layers of Gang Qi that rapidly repaired the Mountain Vein Manifestation. Once again, it unleashed a world-shattering strike.

"I can unleash that attack eight more times," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "Using my Gang Qi and physical body to channel and unleash the Heaven Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power's overwhelming might, delivering the power of Double Heaven Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power in a single strike... With my current strength, my physical condition will begin to deteriorate after just three more uses, and the damage will accumulate rapidly."

"After six uses, the power of each strike will diminish significantly."

"After nine uses, I'll have reached my absolute limit."

As Zhang Yu pondered, the Mountain-Moving Warrior let out a long, piercing roar.

In the next instant, the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power erupted violently, drawing the surging Earthly Fiend Gravity toward itself.

In a flash, as the atmosphere was compressed, shockwaves radiated outward from the warrior's body in all directions.

Amidst the churning shockwaves, Zhang Yu's hands each held a black and a white star, and he once again hurled them toward the Earth Surge God.

In the ensuing chaotic clash, the two combatants exchanged six more brutal strikes.

The Mountain-Moving Warrior continued to shatter and shrink, its size dwindling to less than half its original form.

With a final crash, the Earth Surge God collapsed to its knees, its body riddled with massive damage, rendering it incapable of further combat.

Watching the scene unfold, Zhang Yu said calmly, "It's over."

During the relentless clashes, Zhang Yu's mind had been flooded with information about the Earth Surge God's functions and structure.

He had identified several critical weaknesses in its spiritual energy circuits and Vibration Joints, which perfectly aligned with the severe damage he had inflicted.

All of this stemmed from his cultivation of the Treasure Appraisal Manual.

Throughout the fierce battle, Zhang Yu had not only pushed his physical body, Gang Qi, and Cultivation to their absolute limits, but more importantly, he had used the Treasure Appraisal Manual to pinpoint his targets and maximize the damage.

Wan Gouxuan stared up at Zhang Yu, who hovered above him, looking down with his fingers spread wide as the surging Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power coalesced once more.

"He actually defeated my Earth Surge God single-handedly," Wan Gouxuan sighed inwardly. "This guy... has he really only mastered the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power for a few months?"

At that moment, Wan Gouxuan decided to pause the competition and request reinforcements.

According to their prior arrangements, this was the necessary course of action if they faced a pincer attack from Mo Shangjin.

But now, Wan Gouxuan realized that he couldn't even defeat Zhang Yu alone.

After Wan Gouxuan requested a timeout, the Artifact Refinement Department student who was supposed to provide support said, "Forget it. Don't waste the money."

"Even if I temporarily repair and enhance your Earth Surge God, you might not be able to defeat Zhang Yu, let alone Mo Shangjin."

The student shook his head. "I need to prepare for the Ten Great Leagues this year. I don't have time to waste on this."

Without the promised support, Wan Gouxuan knew the outcome of the match was sealed.

As expected, when the timeout ended and the match resumed, the Immortal Armaments University team collapsed like a house of cards. Not only was the Earth Surge God completely dismantled, but the team members surrendered one by one.

The Myriad Laws University team cheered as they left the arena.

Director Gao nodded with a smile in the audience, thinking, "The next match is the finals against Celestial Monsters University."

He also understood that this final battle was crucial not only for Zhang Yu but for himself as well.

If they won, it would be the Civil Engineering Department's first major achievement since he took over as director.

With this in mind, he turned to True Monarch Magnetic Pole beside him and said, "Magnetic Pole, thank you. Zhang Yu wouldn't have grown so quickly without your help."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole opened her mouth to speak. "Old Gao, actually..."

Director Gao raised an eyebrow. "Hmm?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "It's nothing."

"I'll wait until after the Civil Engineering Finals to say anything," she thought.

"Once the Civil Engineering Finals are over, Zhang Yu's overall score will be more than enough. We can arrange his transfer immediately to avoid any complications."

Looking at Director Gao, True Monarch Magnetic Pole mused inwardly, "Old Gao, don't blame me. Talented disciples like Zhang Yu belong to the strong in Kunxu. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for not being strong enough or rich enough."

Just then, True Monarch Thousand Puppets from Immortal Armaments University spoke up, "Magnetic Pole, judging by this student's performance, your decryption work is progressing remarkably well. You're about to make a fortune. If you're willing to exchange your technology for market access at Immortal Armaments University, we can discuss terms."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied coolly, "I have no interest at the moment."

True Monarch Thousand Puppets smiled faintly. "I've heard Divine Monarch Jade Nectar is rallying support to pressure Myriad Laws University and impose sanctions on your Artifact Refinement Department. If you're interested in collaborating, you can find me anytime."

"Until the Ten Great Leagues, then. Many are eagerly anticipating what surprises Myriad Laws University might bring this time."

Director Gao frowned as he overheard the conversation, thinking to himself, "This project is gaining too much attention. It risks making Myriad Laws the center of a storm, gradually turning Magnetic Pole into a target of public criticism."

Although Director Gao believed the escalation of the University War was inevitable and that the Ten Greats would eventually enter the fray, he didn't want Myriad Laws to be the first to fall, nor did he want Magnetic Pole to be the spark that ignited the conflict.

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu left the arena, he noticed Wan Gouxuan and his team looked remarkably calm, even showing faint traces of joy and excitement. They didn't seem at all like they had lost the match and had their Giant Puppet dismantled.

Zhang Yu's instincts were correct. Though Wan Gouxuan had lost this battle, he didn't feel the same heartache as he had the previous year.

After all, even though they had lost and could only collect some of Zhang Yu's sweat from the arena, the expenses would still be reimbursed, allowing them to replace the puppet's components with brand-new ones.

After the competition, Wan Gouxuan went to the pre-arranged meeting with Extreme Tiger Company. As he reviewed the list of components to be replaced, he thought to himself, "Are they replacing everything with Extreme Tiger Brand parts?"

"The prices seem to have increased tenfold or more."

"As expected, the school is reimbursing us for purchasing all Extreme Tiger Brand components at exorbitant prices. They're deliberately lining Extreme Tiger's pockets."

Wan Gouxuan had no objections, of course. Since he wasn't paying out of pocket, the Earth Surge God would be fully upgraded, its power reaching new heights.

He even suspected that compared to Zhang Yu's material gathering, this overpriced procurement by Extreme Tiger might be more important to some people.

Watching the latest, top-tier Extreme Tiger Brand components being installed, Wan Gouxuan felt the spirit of Immortal Armaments University being infused into the machine.

The teacher beside him said, "For the next competition, use this pure-blooded Extreme Tiger Earth Surge God to change all schools' perception of Extreme Tiger. Just like Myriad Laws University's pure-blooded Myriad Paths Artisan Sect and Vajra University's pure-blooded Vajra Profound Creation, this is the inevitable path for magical artifact companies to rise from low-end to high-end markets."

Wan Gouxuan nodded, thinking to himself, "Zhang Yu, next year we'll battle again. I..."

Just as the thought formed, Wan Gouxuan's brow furrowed. Though the Earth Surge God had become stronger, without reimbursement next year, his combat power might actually be lower than it was today.

He sighed inwardly, "Alas, the Myriad Laws Civil Engineering Department... it seems we have no chance of victory for the next few years."

On his way back, Zhang Yu received messages from Director Gao and Magnetic Pole.

Director Gao: "In the next battle, Mo Shangjin will join you."

Director Gao: "Work well together and strive to win the Civil Engineering Finals."

Director Gao: "But if it proves too difficult, don't force it. Celestial Monsters University has always excelled in this area. Preserving your potential is paramount."

Director Gao offered his usual encouragement, urging Zhang Yu not to become complacent and to continue working hard for a strong performance in the Finals. He then inquired about Zhang Yu's recent work and life."

Director Gao: "I heard your company is doing well. I'll have Tu Lishan assign you more projects in the coming days."

Director Gao: "Next week, accompany me to meet the other Civil Engineering Department professors. I'll introduce you around."

Director Gao: "The future of the Civil Engineering Department rests on young talents like you."

Director Gao: "Success in this field requires not only practical skills on construction sites but also strong connections."

Director Gao: "Oh, and remember to apply for the Civil Engineering Department's Model Student award this year. I've already put in a good word for you."

Zhang Yu could tell that Director Gao genuinely saw him as his true successor. Whether he won the Finals or not, the director would personally guide him through the intricacies of the Civil Engineering Realm.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's message was far more direct.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "If you win the next Finals match, start preparing to transfer departments immediately."

Zhang Yu: "Transfer departments right after winning the championship? Isn't that too hasty?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "What? Are you reluctant to leave your Civil Engineering Department?"

Zhang Yu: "No, I'm just worried Director Gao might not let me go."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "A good teacher wouldn't stand in the way of a student reaching a better platform."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Besides, your immediate priority is securing victory in the next match."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Even though it's just the Civil Engineering Department, Celestial Monsters University's Civil Engineering Department has always been strong."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Don't worry about your teacher. Focus your mind on your own strength and use the remaining time to improve as much as possible."

Myriad Laws University.

Inside the dormitory.

"You're injured?"

Le Mulan handed a Potion to Zhang Yu. The Potion was unpackaged, contained only in a simple glass bottle.

She said somewhat awkwardly, "This is... a Potion I made. Would you like to try it?"

Le Mulan didn't know exactly how high Zhang Yu's current income was, only that it was very, very high.

She simply hoped that her most precious Potion could help Zhang Yu as it had in the past.

Zhang Yu took the Potion with a slight smile. "Thanks."

Noting that the upcoming battle against Celestial Monsters University was next week, Zhang Yu wasted no time resting. After briefly tidying up and maintaining his magical artifacts, he resumed his usual cultivation and work.

In this final week, he would do everything he could to improve himself.

Reflecting on his three years of high school and nearly three years of relentless effort in university, he was now on the verge of transferring to the Artifact Refinement Department, bringing him one step closer to joining one of the Ten Great Sects. He would not allow any mistakes to derail him at this critical juncture.
