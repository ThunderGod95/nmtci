# Chapter 718: Zhang Yu's Third Visit, Immortal Sect Black Art

Seeing Fu Xiantian before him, Zhang Yu was instantly startled, his mind shifting into high alert.

His Magic Power surged through his body, ready to activate the two Immortal Sect Techniques at any moment.

Nearby, the equipment box trembled slightly as the Heaven-Shattering War God Armor completed its connection, ready to deploy and equip.

Simultaneously, numerous Nascent Soul cultivators from Myriad Laws University received Zhang Yu's message and were already rushing toward the Research Association.

A dense network of Spirit Realm information pulsed around Zhang Yu's body, transmitting messages in all directions.

Fu Xiantian, observing all this, remained unconcerned. He simply said calmly, "Don't be tense, Zhang Yu. I've only come to talk."

"My full power remains on the Fifth Layer, suppressing the Soul Transformation Expert of the Ten Tuniversities. The consciousness speaking to you is merely a thread of thought projected across the Spirit Realm."

With that, Fu Xiantian regarded Zhang Yu with a scrutinizing gaze.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Just to talk?"

He studied Fu Xiantian, sensing that the figure was indeed a mere Spirit Realm Projection — a pure image carrying no actual power.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Lady Fortune, have you noticed anything?"

Lady Fortune replied, "It's definitely just a projection through Xiong Wenwu's Bionic Eye. He shouldn't be able to use force to threaten your safety."

"My suggestion is... talk to him," Lady Fortune continued. "See what he wants and if you can gather any intelligence. After all, talking won't hurt."

Lady Fortune's idea aligned perfectly with Zhang Yu's own thoughts.

He immediately sent a message, instructing all the Nascent Soul Cultivators who had arrived to halt and await orders outside the Research Association.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu pondered, "Could this person's visit be related to the Heaven-Piercing Plan?"

Although Zhang Yu had kept the Heaven-Piercing Plan as secret as possible, its scope had inevitably expanded with the continuous development of various channels and production lines. It was impossible to keep it hidden from the Righteous Qi Alliance forever.

If Fu Xiantian had come because of this, Zhang Yu wouldn't be surprised.

Zhang Yu asked, "How is Xiong Wenwu?"

Fu Xiantian countered, "Are you concerned about him? Worried about your fellow countryman from the First Layer, even though he's a monsterfolk?"

Zhang Yu said calmly, "It's not about you. His condition will simply influence my attitude toward this conversation."

Fu Xiantian replied casually, "He's fine, not in any life-threatening danger. He's sleeping soundly now, probably the best sleep he's had in ages. He doesn't even know I'm using his Bionic Eye to communicate with you."

Zhang Yu asked, "What do you want to discuss?"

Fu Xiantian said flatly, "To be honest, based on my own judgment, I don't think we should be having this conversation at all."

"But I trust my Master's judgment."

"So I'm willing to talk to you, willing to try... to guide you onto the right path."

Zhang Yu's gaze shifted slightly. "Who is this Master you speak of?"

Fu Xiantian looked up at the sky, his gaze seeming to pierce through the clouds, through the firmament, toward the vanished Sixth Layer of Kunxu.

"The Immortal who initiated this revolution, who drew away the Sixth Layer, who blocked the Heavenly Court, and who brought the hope of a New World to billions of living beings — Ying Xintian."

"He is my Master."

"It was he who recognized your potential," Fu Xiantian said, looking directly at Zhang Yu. "He wanted to take you away, to bring you directly to the Sixth Layer and the New World he was creating. But alas..."

Fu Xiantian lowered his eyelids and sighed. "You refused."

Hearing Fu Xiantian's words, Zhang Yu's mind instantly flashed back to the moment Dao Qiankun had tried to take him away.

Dao Qiankun... Ying Xintian...

Zhang Yu chewed on these two names in his mind before finally asking a question that had long plagued him, a question he desperately wanted answered.

"Whether it's Brother Dao or Ying Xintian, did they know the Second to Fifth Layers would end up like this?"

"How could they possibly create a New World based on this current war and chaos, relying on the Demonic Sects, Evil Gods, and Finance Department types within the Righteous Qi Alliance?"

Instead of directly answering Zhang Yu's question, Fu Xiantian shifted the topic.

"In the Kunxu of old," Fu Xiantian said calmly, "the battle between good and evil raged fiercely, a great war between Immortals and Demons."

"At that time, the Demonic Dao held an overwhelming advantage. To reverse their impending defeat and match the Demonic Dao's combat prowess, the Righteous Path initiated a self-reform — a revolution to transform itself."

"Some called this movement 'Unconstrained Transformation' a Righteous Use of Demonic Arts."

"Master was one of its earliest proponents, understanding that without this method, the Righteous Path would inevitably fall. The world would descend into chaos, countless lives would become mere sustenance for the Demonic Dao, and the Human Race would be reduced to beings worse than pigs or dogs, mere livestock."

"To advance this reform, Master intercepted the fiercely opposing Martial Uncle, intending to wait until the situation stabilized before returning together..."

"But when Master and his Martial Uncle finally returned, they discovered that many sect members who had resisted to the death had already been slaughtered by the sect leader and his forces."

"Later, Martial Uncle, seeking vengeance for this blood debt, assassinated one of the sect elders who had spearheaded the reform, leading to his encirclement."

"To continue pushing for reform and ensure the sacrifices of the fallen were not in vain, Master ultimately participated in the encirclement, joining other sect members in... suppressing his Martial Uncle."

"Similar tragedies occurred countless times during that era."

"To promote the Righteous Use of Demonic Arts, the various sects of the Righteous Path suffered countless losses. Masters turned against disciples, fathers against sons, husbands against wives, and sects split apart... such tragedies were countless."

Fu Xiantian looked directly at Zhang Yu and said, "This is the price of world transformation. Change always brings conflict."

"The so-called Righteous Use of Demonic Arts means that many traditional Righteous Path methods must be discarded. Their industries, families, sects, and status will suffer immense losses, even extinction. Naturally, they will resist."

"This is the nature of change. The process of transformation inevitably harms some while benefiting others. It is forever accompanied by struggle and bloodshed, always demanding sacrifice."

Fu Xiantian walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing out at the research district. He took in the endless rows of towering buildings, the bustling streets, and the ceaseless flow of Spirit Realm information.

He murmured, "The roots of the Demonic Dao run deep in Kunxu. We have reached a point where change is inevitable, yet the resistance to transformation is stronger than ever before."

"To achieve this goal, Master abandoned all his assets as an Immortal."

"The value of those assets far exceeded the combined worth of everything on the Second to Fifth Layers."

"Compared to Master's sacrifice, what are the losses on the Second to Fifth Layers now?"

Fu Xiantian turned his head and looked directly at Zhang Yu again. "Even I abandoned everything I once had in the sect, reincarnating to advance the Heaven-Shattering Plan on the Second to Fifth Layers."

"Because both Master and I knew Kunxu couldn't continue like this any longer."

Fu Xiantian sighed, countless images flashing through his eyes. "Zhang Yu, I was once a Kunxu person from the First Layer. I climbed up step by step and witnessed firsthand the changes Kunxu has undergone over the years."

"Do you think it's a coincidence that so many in Kunxu lack Spiritual Roots? It's because someone is stealing the power of Reincarnation, extracting the innate talent and spiritual essence of billions of souls destined for rebirth and new life, all to enrich themselves and their sect. And they're taking more each year."

"Why do you think the sects' technology always surpasses that of the Ten Great Universities? It's not just because of the Immortal Dao Technology blockade. It's because someone established a Dao Lineage. Every creation, invention, and Spirit Inspiration from the Lower Realm is immediately recorded in the Dao Repository. No matter how vast the world or how numerous the Heavenly Chosen, none can escape its control."

"Why do you think so many in the lower strata still strive to climb upward? Why hasn't the birth rate declined? Because each person's purpose is predetermined at birth."

"Those destined to bear children will desire to do so. Upon Reincarnation, not a single trace of excess spiritual essence remains; it is completely extracted."

"Those destined to cultivate the Immortal Dao will devote themselves to the Dao, yet they too must abide by various rules, having their spiritual essence drained..."

"Even if they climb to the top, what then? Some now believe that every thought we have, every memory we hold, should be taxed..."

"Zhang Yu, can you understand our resolve?"

"Kunxu must change."

Seeing Zhang Yu fall silent, Fu Xiantian said, "It seems you truly are different from the other Kunxu People of this era. Let's end here for today. Think carefully about what we've discussed, and we'll continue tomorrow."

"Tomorrow, at the same time, I'll come speak with you again."

Zhang Yu gazed up at the firmament, feeling that the upper echelons of Kunxu were even darker than he had originally imagined.

"But no matter what..."

Sensing the ritual power circulating within him and observing the Soul Transformation Divine Light on the Fifth Layer, Zhang Yu knew he couldn't stop.

Whether for his own life and safety, to rescue Magnetic Pole and Greenwood, or to protect his comrades, he couldn't afford to halt his progress.

Just then, an alarm sounded from Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

His gaze sharpened as he saw a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch from Immortal Armaments University whose divine light was rapidly dimming, already at a mere 5% of its original intensity.

Soon, the monarch's light completely extinguished.

With this loss, the Soul Transformation Experts of the Ten Tuniversities were reduced to 37, while the Righteous Qi Alliance still maintained 44.

Zhang Yu gazed at the divine light in the sky, knowing that while the numbers seemed close, this small difference would be a massive disadvantage on the battlefield.

"37 against 44. This means at least several Soul Transformation Experts of the Ten Tuniversities will have to face multiple enemies alone."

"And after each Soul Transformation Expert of the Ten Tuniversities falls, the Righteous Qi Alliance powerhouse who defeated them will join the assault on the next one."

Zhang Yu understood that this was like an avalanche. Each fallen Soul Transformation Expert of the Ten Tuniversities would accelerate the momentum of defeat, making the process increasingly rapid and overwhelming.

"Once we reach a critical point, the battle could be decided within hours."

Moreover, Zhang Yu knew that the loss of another Soul Transformation Cultivator would inevitably demoralize the Ten Universities forces.

He glanced at the estimated completion time for the Heaven-Piercing Plan. As expected, it had increased by several hours, from 5 days, 12 hours, 3 minutes, and 27 seconds to 5 days, 17 hours, 23 minutes, and 8 seconds.

But Zhang Yu had no time for despair. Faced with overwhelming pressure, he could only give his all.

---

True Monarch String Tone, hearing Zhang Yu's words, exclaimed in surprise, "Give concessions to Junior College Students and monsterfolk?"

He thought to himself, "Impossible... Oh, I see. It's not about giving real concessions, but making them think they're getting them."

Soon, under Myriad Laws University's promotion, a massive propaganda campaign was launched.

Ye Xingli resumed her livestream, attracting countless Lower College Students and Junior College Students.

"I think Junior College is great!"

"I don't care about my friends' educational background."

"You're asking about Junior College? Lower College? It's not bad either."

"The Students of the Top Ten around me have never shown any academic discrimination."

"The Ten Universities are already discussing welfare policies. Let's just be patient and wait."

While livestreaming, the Poverty Simulator in Ye Xingli's Eye Relic was running at full speed, activated to its "Absolute Poverty" level — a setting she had never used before, not even during her conversations with Zhang Yu. This pulled her, a Student of the Top Ten, down to the lowest rung of Junior College Students, forcing her to constantly spout specialized jargon.

The sheer volume of statements that contradicted her true feelings and mental cultivation technique shook her dao heart, making her lament how difficult it was to earn money.

However, thanks to Myriad Laws University's massive financial backing and the overwhelming attention from Lower College Students and Junior College Students, Ye Xingli's viewership skyrocketed, sparking widespread discussion.

"Ye Xingli is different. She doesn't discriminate against us."

"I feel like she's communicating with us as equals."

"She doesn't promote products or take ads! She's just here to listen to our voices!"

"She's just making money off the school's reputation. She definitely got funding from the Ten Greats." (Deleted)

Meanwhile, Zhao Tianxing also began appearing in numerous advertisements and videos.

Born on the First Layer, a Soul Cultivator student with a Vocational College diploma, he had now defied expectations to become a half-Myriad Laws practitioner and even achieved Foundation Establishment breakthrough in the Spirit Realm.

As a model success story, Zhao Tianxing was heavily promoted by Myriad Laws, becoming a "cool" protagonist figure and a role model for countless Junior College and Soul Cultivator students.

Facing the camera, Zhao Tianxing declared loudly, "Everyone! The special Junior College to Bachelor's Degree Program is real!"

"Foundation Establishment for Soul Cultivators is also real!"

"Do you want it? Then come work for us! As long as you work hard, we not only have endless job opportunities, but also chances for the Junior College to Bachelor's Degree Program and Foundation Establishment!"

At the same time, damning revelations about the Righteous Qi Alliance's failure to pay wages, forcing members into unpaid labor and life-threatening missions, were continuously leaked.

As the propaganda campaign intensified, Zhang Yu observed the estimated completion time for their plan rapidly diminishing.

4 days 10 hours 3 minutes 38 seconds

Zhang Yu gazed at the sky. Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's luminosity had dropped to 71%, while Divine Monarch Greenwood's had fallen to 59%.

Simultaneously, Fu Xiantian reappeared, fulfilling his promise to hold a second conversation with Zhang Yu.

---

"Zhang Yu, this world is sick. The Immortal Emperors' greed will inevitably destroy everything."

Fu Xiantian tapped his finger lightly, and images unfolded before Zhang Yu's eyes.

"This... is the future Sixth Layer, a New World designed by my Master."

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened as he saw people living in peace and contentment, their faces radiant with smiles.

Fu Xiantian explained, "In the New World, everyone will have Dual Rest, holidays, leisure, and security."

"No one will live solely to pursue profit, nor will weakness be a source of shame."

"Humans will no longer exist merely to work."

As Zhang Yu studied the images, he had to admit he liked the idea of such a world.

But could such a world truly exist?

And could Fu Xiantian and his allies truly create it?

Sensing Zhang Yu's doubts, Fu Xiantian said, "In the New World, we will adjust everyone's innate talent, restoring all things to their natural state."

"Simultaneously, everyone's cultivation and assets will be redistributed, granting each individual limitless potential."

"The New World's Reincarnation System will be completely stripped of its Demonic Dao attributes, making it impossible for anyone to manipulate it..."

As Fu Xiantian continued his explanation, Lady Fortune scoffed, "After all this talk, it's still the same old story. In the end, it's Ying Xintian, the Immortal, who calls the shots. The fate of the entire world rests solely on his whims. Who knows if he'll just turn it into another Kunxu in the future?"

Fu Xiantian continued, "In this New World, my Master will set a lifespan limit of approximately 1500 years for all beings, including ourselves."

Zhang Yu was taken aback. "If you set such a limit, wouldn't you and your Master, who have already lived far beyond 1500 years, immediately die?"

Fu Xiantian nodded.

Lady Fortune scoffed, "Are you two mad? This has to be a lie. No one would willingly commit suicide!"

Fu Xiantian sighed. "The downfall of Kunxu lies in the pursuit of immortality. Only by limiting the lifespan of all living beings — humans, monsters, artifact spirits, Soul Cultivators... every sentient creature — to under 1500 years, regardless of their cultivation level, can we ensure that no single entity becomes an eternal protagonist. Only then can the world thrive in perpetual renewal."

"Even if the Demonic Dao were to flourish one day, it would only be temporary. Limited by lifespan, every sect and dynasty will inevitably rise and fall. Eventually, future generations will overcome the Demonic Dao and restore the Righteous Path..."

"Zhang Yu, my Master and I are not fools. We understand that there are no permanent solutions in this world, and we never intended to solve all problems at once."

"Everything evolves through change, and everything is resolved through change. The problems of the future are endless, but as long as change persists and new generations emerge, there will always be hope..."

Zhang Yu remained silent. Fu Xiantian's vision for the New World extended far beyond this brief explanation. The details, principles, and plans were vast and complex.

Even with Zhang Yu's cultivation level, he could only grasp the general outline.

As for whether these ideas were right or wrong, good or bad, Zhang Yu couldn't immediately discern.

Zhang Yu raised his head and looked at Fu Xiantian. "You told me about the lifespan limit. Aren't you worried I'll disagree?"

Fu Xiantian regarded Zhang Yu calmly. "As I said, Zhang Yu, my purpose in speaking with you is to guide you back to the Righteous Path."

"If you cling to immortality, obsess over cultivation and power, and thus reject the New World, it merely proves we walk different paths. It also shows that Master misjudged you."

"To me, it's just one more defeat."

"Nothing more."

As he spoke, the alarm blared again, and another Soul Transformation Divine Light plummeted below 5%.

Moments later, that divine light vanished completely.

A Soul Transformation Divine Monarch from Heavenly Demon University had fallen.

Footage of the Divine Monarch's demise spread like wildfire through the Dark Spirit Realm, even spilling into the Spirit Realm.

With another Divine Monarch's fall, morale among the Ten Great Universities plummeted further, and the number of defectors to the Righteous Qi Alliance surged again.

Zhang Yu and many others immediately noticed the Heaven-Piercing Plan's completion time had skyrocketed to 6 days, 8 hours, 13 minutes, and 22 seconds.

Watching this number change, many within the Ten Great Universities felt their previous efforts had been instantly vaporized by this shift in the Soul Transformation Battlefield.

Still gazing at the sky, Fu Xiantian continued, "Let's end here for today. We'll resume our discussion tomorrow."

With those words, Fu Xiantian's figure vanished once more.

Zhang Yu lifted his head, gazing at the divine light in the sky. He watched as the radiant glow gradually dimmed, his mind swirling with countless thoughts.

Over the next day, the internal and external conflicts within the Ten Universities intensified under pressure from the Righteous Qi Alliance.

The rebellions of Junior College Students, monsterfolk students, and Lower College Students continued unabated.

The restrictions imposed by various universities, companies, and platforms grew increasingly stringent, triggering further backlash.

The Dark Spirit Realm's propaganda offensive surged relentlessly, with ever more information seeping into the Spirit Realm, as if no amount of censorship could contain it.

In the sky, another Soul Transformation cultivator's divine light dimmed, resembling an elder slowly approaching death under the gaze of the masses.

Within Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye, messages cascaded down like snowflakes, each representing a conflict within companies, between Myriad Laws University and external forces, or within Myriad Laws University itself, awaiting his decision.

By the second day, the estimated time remaining for the Heaven-Piercing Plan still stood at a staggering 6 days, 2 hours, 8 minutes, and 31 seconds, plunging countless hearts into deeper despair.

It was at this moment that Fu Xiantian descended for the third time, appearing before Zhang Yu.

---

"Still resisting?" Fu Xiantian asked calmly. "Even if your current chances of success are virtually zero, what will you achieve if you do succeed? Once the Heavenly Court descends, do you really think everything you've done will go unpunished?"

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened. "What are you implying?"

Fu Xiantian replied, "Your Spatial Technology research, the devastation and losses caused by the war, and the excessive issuance of realm qualification certificates — how do you think the Heavenly Court will handle these matters?"

He shook his head, his voice radiating an air of certainty. "Based on my understanding of those above, I can tell you plainly: your Spatial Technology, along with all related companies and factories, will be seized by the Heavenly Court's envoys the moment they return. The surplus of Golden Core, Nascent Soul, and even Soul Transformation Cultivators will be purged. They might conduct another assessment to filter the Golden Core and Nascent Soul Cultivators, demoting those who fail. Alternatively, they might send the excess Soul Transformation Cultivators to the upper realms as laborers. In any case, none of you will meet a favorable end."

"The Ten Immortal Emperors might also subject the second to fifth layers of Kunxu to ideological correction, erasing all the changes that occurred during the period of disconnection. However, all the losses will be transformed into debts, which you survivors will have to collectively bear."

Zhang Yu's heart jolted at these words. "Ideological correction? What is ideological correction?"

Fu Xiantian replied calmly, "Legend has it that each of the Ten Immortal Emperors, who stand at the pinnacle of Immortal Dao Technology, possesses a Supreme Immortal Artifact capable of interfering with the Heavenly Dao's operation."

"According to legend, if they unanimously agree, they could theoretically correct the entire world, reshaping all people and things to their satisfaction."

"Of course, legends are just legends. The Ten Immortal Emperors are rife with conflicting interests and have never reached consensus on any matter. Thus, the so-called correction of the entire world has never actually occurred."

"However, ideological correction has indeed happened."

"If the Heavenly Court descends and discovers the drastic changes in the second to fifth layers, the Ten Immortal Emperors might subject these layers to ideological correction, forcibly restoring your memories and thoughts to a state more aligned with Kunxu's requirements."

Zhang Yu's heart jolted at the words, once again feeling the terrifying power of Kunxu's upper echelons.

Fu Xiantian continued, "Therefore, to create a New World, we must break free from Kunxu and escape the control of the Ten Immortal Emperors."

Zhang Yu asked gravely, "So, you plan to take the Sixth Layer out of Kunxu? And now you want to take Layers Two through Five as well? Even if it means sacrificing so many lives?"

Fu Xiantian: "Sacrifice?"

He sighed, "Is this what has been troubling you all along?"

He looked Zhang Yu in the eyes and said, "Zhang Yu, do you remember what Dao Qiankun said?"

"Reincarnation exists."

Zhang Yu's mind instantly flashed back to Dao Qiankun's words at the award ceremony.

"Death is not the end, but a new beginning."

"Everyone who dies will be reincarnated."

"Do not fear death."

At that moment, Fu Xiantian repeated these words, then added, "Now, all the beings who have died in Layers Two through Five will be sent into the Reincarnation System, awaiting their entry into the New World's cycle of rebirth."

"Zhang Yu, they haven't died. They're merely about to begin new lives."

"In this world, only when a soul scatters and the spirit gets extinguished is it true death."

"Entering Reincarnation is merely a fresh start."

Zhang Yu's heart jolted again. "You've already mastered the second to fifth layers of Reincarnation?"

Fu Xiantian smiled faintly and flicked his finger, instantly sending a document to Zhang Yu.

"This cultivation art is called the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture," he said. "It's a Strategic-level Immortal Sect Technique. However, it has been removed from the Dao Repository and is now considered a black art."

"Even so, the Immortal Dao Technology it contains directly points to the Great Dao of Reincarnation."

"What I'm giving you today is the introductory technique. By practicing it according to the method, you can awaken the past life memories of your previous incarnation."

"With your talent and aptitude, you should be able to verify from this... that we have already grasped the power of Reincarnation."

Zhang Yu stared at the cultivation art in astonishment, then turned to Fu Xiantian. "You're just giving this to me like that?"

Fu Xiantian lowered his gaze and said calmly, "Practice it. With your talent and the resources you now command, mastering the introductory technique will be effortless."

Zhang Yu looked at the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture within his Bionic Eye, seemingly caught in a moment of hesitation.
