# Chapter 148: Battle with Zhou Chechen

In that instant, the very air seemed to freeze under Zhou Chechen's palm. A biting cold wind blasted toward Zhang Yu, rapidly stripping the heat from his flesh and blood.

Seeing this, Lei Jun thought to himself, _A fine provocation._

This time, however, Lei Jun didn't speak his analysis aloud for everyone to hear, instead pondering it himself, simply because he didn't want to alert Zhou Chechen.

He thought, _If Zhou Chechen were allowed to act freely, his freezing qi field would be too difficult to deal with. He could just keep moving around and slowly wear down his opponent._

_But Zhang Yu's words have forced Zhou Chechen to attack him head-on._

_The ten-move agreement, in particular, has put Zhou Chechen on the spot. As the vice president of the Student Council, how could he possibly agree to such a large number in front of so many people? He was bound to counter with a lower number._

_Thus, what was originally Zhou Chechen's favored battle of attrition has been transformed into an all-out assault within three moves._

_Who would have thought Zhang Yu's combat experience was so rich?_

_The only question is… can Zhang Yu really take three of Zhou Chechen’s moves?_

At the same time.

A terrifying cold qi slammed into Zhang Yu's body like a long dragon.

Zhou Chechen said flatly, “First move. Just to get you acquainted with my Frost Heaven Freezing Qi Field.”

As he spoke, Zhou Chechen began to walk slowly toward Zhang Yu.

With each step he took, the mana fluctuations from his body grew more alarming. A sky-piercing cold qi spread out in all directions, gradually condensing a layer of frost on the floor, ceiling, and walls.

Zhao Tianxing and the other first-year students, even from a great distance, felt themselves shivering uncontrollably. They exhaled puffs of white air as they backed away repeatedly, their faces filled with horror as they looked in Zhou Chechen's direction.

“Second move.”

Zhou Chechen made a gentle pinching motion toward Zhang Yu. The vast, spreading cold qi, as if receiving a command from an emperor, converged into a giant hand of ice and crushed down on Zhang Yu.

With a series of soft crackling sounds, a layer of frost seemed to form all over Zhang Yu's body, and his skin lost its color at a visible rate.

Zhou Chechen said flatly, “Zhang Yu, I know you’re very tough, very good at taking a beating.”

“But after being rapidly cooled by my Frost Heaven Freezing Qi Field, your blood vessels will gradually freeze, your body will become deprived of oxygen, and every single one of your cells will be damaged…”

Simultaneously, the mana circulation within Zhang Yu’s body was roaring. Great Sun mana, like molten lava, surged throughout his body, emitting scorching heat.

The Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi was also activated, causing his muscles to radiate waves of heat.

The Subcutaneous Astral Qi, formed from the Formless Cloud-Astral Qi, worked in concert with the Imperishable Seal Art, continuously resisting the encroaching cold qi and keeping it all at bay outside his body.

But Zhang Yu could feel that Zhou Chechen's current attack contained not only the Frost Heaven Freezing Qi Field he spoke of, but also the power of the Frost Prison Art, which was subtly affecting his spirit.

At this moment, he felt as if his ears were filled with the dying groans of countless wraiths. Powerful waves of resentment were assaulting his sea of consciousness, shaking his Dao heart.

Although the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art was active, and the Martial Ascension Will continuously crushed and suppressed these resentments.

Zhang Yu felt his Martial Ascension Will was like a soldier on a battlefield, killing and killing and killing again. After waves of slaughter, it too was gradually growing fatigued, entangled by the resentments like fine threads.

As the circulation of his heart art became sluggish, Zhang Yu felt a layer of resistance in the execution of his martial arts and the flow of his mana.

_This won't do. The Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art isn't well-suited for dealing with this Frost Prison Art…_

Realizing this, Zhang Yu, as if by a stroke of genius, switched his heart art to the Crippled Ox Body-Sacrifice Heart Art.

This was an almost instinctual reaction for him, having cultivated both techniques to the tenth level.

As he switched heart arts, he felt the encroaching death-resentment wrap around the crippled ox in his mind, yet it failed to cause any ripples in the heart art.

The crippled ox seemed as if it had long grown accustomed to crawling along a road paved with corpses, its mind feeling nothing but profound peace.

Meanwhile, Zhou Chechen coldly watched Zhang Yu, who was now covered in frost and completely motionless. He slowly walked up to him and said flatly, “It’s over, junior.”

“By now, your entire body should be frozen solid.”

“But don’t worry, this bit of frostbite won’t require a trip to the medical room. It will just make it impossible for you to cultivate and study properly for the next day or two.”

“Consider this a small punishment for disrespecting your senior.”

Just as he was about to poke Zhang Yu over with a finger, he felt a wave of heat wash over his face.

The frost covering Zhang Yu’s body continuously disappeared. Apart from some minor skin damage, he appeared to be in high spirits, showing no signs of any problems.

Zhang Yu said, “Senior, there’s one move left.”

Zhou Chechen’s eyes narrowed slightly as he looked at Zhang Yu in earnest. “Then allow me to instruct you with one more move.”

With that, Zhou Chechen spread his five fingers, and the vast freezing qi gathered toward his palm as his entire body’s mana was converted into threads of frosty palm power and infused into it.

“Kneel for me!”

Zhou Chechen’s full-powered palm strike slammed down toward Zhang Yu, landing heavily on his shoulder.

The wind howled, and frost shuddered.

As a wave of air exploded from the point of contact, it was as if an ice storm had swept through the training hall, causing the temperature to plummet.

Zhou Chechen and Zhang Yu stood face-to-face, their gazes seeming to clash with sparks.

The muscles of a third-year senior were brought to their full potential in Zhou Chechen's body. A terrifying force, like the Sky Pillar itself, sought to press Zhang Yu down inch by inch.

At the same time, bone-chilling frost continuously enveloped Zhang Yu’s body, seeking to strip away his vital energy and destroy the foundation of his strength.

Zhou Chechen intended to press Zhang Yu to the ground and freeze him there in a kneeling position.

He wanted to humiliate him on behalf of all seniors, establish the authority of the Student Council, and after beating this dog, see who its current master was…

But to his surprise, an unexpectedly strong resistance erupted from within Zhang Yu's body. It was like a spring, pushing back with greater force the more he pressed down.

The heat radiating from beneath the surface of that body was preventing his freezing qi from penetrating in a short amount of time.

Fu Ji laughed. _This guy’s instantaneous explosive power really is lacking. If he had competed with you in mana, moved around the field, and dragged it into a battle of attrition, it would have been troublesome. But now that he’s willingly walked right up to you, it’s much easier…_

Just then, Zhang Yu spoke. “Senior, three moves have passed.”

“Why don’t you try taking a move from me?”

Zhou Chechen’s expression changed. Seeing his opponent’s outstretched hands, he immediately moved to block.

He had seen Zhang Yu’s close-quarters combat skills before and was naturally wary, unwilling to be caught off guard.

But in the next moment, he found that his opponent's hands were not exerting much force.

Then, a boom exploded in his abdomen.

In that instant, as Zhang Yu repelled Zhou Chechen’s palm, he gathered all of his own strength and, taking advantage of Zhou Chechen’s divided attention, slammed a knee viciously into his stomach.

Seeing this, Lei Jun slapped his thigh in admiration. “Unexpected! A brilliant sneak attack!”

Terrifying force squeezed Zhou Chechen’s skin, muscles, stomach…

Zhou Chechen felt as if his stomach was being viciously kneaded, deformed, and compressed by a giant hand, as if it was about to force out everything inside him…

Zhou Chechen’s mouth flew open, and then he clamped it shut just as quickly.

“Senior, let me help you.”

As Zhang Yu gave Zhou Chechen’s arm a gentle tug, his center of gravity was pulled and shifted. The urge to vomit that he had just suppressed finally became unbearable, and with a retch, he threw up all over the floor.

Fu Ji laughed heartily. _See, I told you! These rich kids eat ten meals a day. Instead of giving him a minor injury, it’s much better to make him vomit in public!_

After just one heave, Zhou Chechen quickly suppressed it, flung Zhang Yu's hand away, and glared at him. “You…”

Zhang Yu quickly backed away. “My apologies, senior. I wouldn’t have retaliated if I’d known. I didn’t expect one move would be enough to make you vomit.”

From the side, Lei Jun sighed with emotion. “Did you all see that clearly? Just now, Zhou Chechen wanted to force Zhang Yu to his knees, to viciously insult his dignity and damage his Dao heart.”

“But not only did Zhang Yu withstand it, he took advantage of Zhou Chechen’s distraction to make him vomit on the spot, causing him to lose all face.”

“Both sides were treading the line between incurring medical fees and shaming the opponent’s spirit.”

“A slight misstep, and you either pay money or lose face.”

Lei Jun’s voice boomed like thunder across the training hall, causing Zhou Chechen’s brow to furrow tightly and the heart art in his mind to falter.

Boom! With another eruption of freezing qi, the temperature in the entire training hall dropped once more.

This was the terrifying aspect of the Frost Heaven Freezing Qi Field; with continuous use, the ambient temperature would keep dropping, and its power would grow stronger and stronger.

It could be said that having only used three moves, Zhou Chechen was far from unleashing his full combat potential.

But just then, a large hand gently pressed down on his shoulder.

“Student Zhou, the three-move agreement is over,” Lei Jun said with a smile. “If you keep fighting, the other students are going to get hurt.”

“You don’t want to end up paying for all their frostbite medical fees, losing face and money at the same time, do you?”

Zhou Chechen’s gaze hardened. He glanced at Lei Jun, then at the other students who were already turning purple from the cold.

Taking a deep breath, Zhou Chechen understood that today, this was as far as it would go.

Because anything he did from this point on would only lead to further humiliation, and possibly extra expenses. So, he simply gave Zhang Yu a deep look, said nothing, and turned to leave.

Lan Ling followed behind Zhou Chechen, pointing at everyone present. “Put your phones away! No pictures allowed!”

He then hurried after Zhou Chechen, saying irritably, “We should just cancel all of Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen’s competition spots and benefits…”

Zhao Tianxing jumped in fright and quickly put his phone away. A moment later, he couldn’t resist taking it out again to look at the clip of Zhou Chechen being made to vomit.

He thought to himself, _He actually managed to make Zhou Chechen lose face? A'Yu is incredible!_

Zhao Tianxing could already imagine how the group chats would blow up in a moment: First-year Zhang Yu takes three moves from Student Council President Zhou Chechen head-on, then makes him vomit with a single counter-attack.

Just then, notifications were sent out to many group chats, demanding that students be forbidden from disclosing what happened between Zhang Yu and Zhou Chechen, and especially from posting any related videos or photos online…

As the second-year students left, the many first-years looked at Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen with sparkling eyes. This was the first time they had ever seen first-year students who could stand up to the top students of the second year.

Zhang Yu, however, paid no mind to the students’ reactions. He took out his phone and immediately contacted Le Mulan.

“Do you have the contact information for the person in charge of your Purple Cloud Student Council?”

Le Mulan was puzzled. “What are you going to do?”

Zhang Yu recalled the words Zhou Chechen had said to him outside the training hall.

Zhang Yu: “Tell the person in charge at Purple Cloud that as long as they pay, Bai Zhenzhen and I can skip the upcoming competitions.”

“Coming to us directly will definitely be cheaper than them contacting Songyang High School.”
