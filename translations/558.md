# Chapter 558: Borrowing a Puppet

Shi Huaiyu retorted angrily, "We didn't provoke them! They were forcibly restraining Shi Yunxiang, and we were just trying to stop them."

The administrator frowned, explaining, "They saw that Shi Yunxiang was also a monsterfolk and wanted to interact with him. The customs of the monsterfolk differ from those of the Human Race; you need to understand that."

"Moreover, there's a reason for this incident. I asked them about it. Celestial Monsters University has a Reproduction Tax, requiring them to conceive and give birth periodically."

"Several of their colleagues haven't conceived yet, so they're understandably anxious. That's why they pinned Shi Yunxiang to the ground."

Seeing the students' continued skepticism, the administrator couldn't help but say, "You students need to show some understanding for the university's difficulties! Cooperation with Celestial Monsters University is a matter of great concern to many leaders. Can you afford to take responsibility if things go wrong?"

Just then, a monsterfolk nearby shouted, "This can't end here! They injured our people and must pay compensation!"

"Make that Lion Monster serve us until we're all pregnant!"

As the conflict threatened to escalate again, a figure radiating brilliant light slowly approached from outside the construction site.

Above his head floated his ranking: 13th in the Artifact Refinement Department and 44th in the entire university. Behind him, two Military Certificates glowed brightly.

The assembled monsters froze, then erupted in shock.

"Military Artifact Refining Engineering Certificate! And a Military Civil Engineering Certificate too!"

"A noble of artifact refinement with dual Military Certificates!"

"S-such overwhelming pressure!"

"Why would a noble like this come to our construction site? Is he here to devour us?"

As thudding sounds echoed, one after another, the monsterfolk collapsed to the ground, exposing their bellies in the ultimate display of submission to Zhang Yu.

Watching this scene, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "These Celestial Monsters University students truly embody the law of the jungle, showing absolute deference to the strong, even more so than those from Myriad Laws University."

The site supervisor, his face grave, greeted Zhang Yu politely, "President Zhang, you've arrived?"

Just then, streaks of divine power flashed through the air as several Patrol Team Members arrived.

The Patrol Team Leader was about to ask who had called them and who was fighting when his gaze locked onto Zhang Yu.

"You must be Student Zhang Yu?" the Patrol Team Member said politely. "Is there any trouble here?"

Faced with two Military Certificates held by someone ranked among the top 50 students in the entire university, the Patrol Team Member couldn't arrest him unless Zhang Yu initiated an attack. Even if Zhang Yu crippled all the students before his eyes, he would still need authorization from his superiors to make an arrest.

Zhang Yu waved his hand dismissively. "No trouble at all. You've all worked hard. We'll handle things from here."

With that, he swept his gaze across the Celestial Monsters University students and chuckled softly. "Right?"

The monsterfolk trembled at the sight of Zhang Yu's bared teeth. One of them cried out in terror, "Don't eat me!"

The administrator watching the scene couldn't help but interject, "President Zhang, these are students from Celestial Monsters University. We have strict orders from above to avoid any conflict..."

In his view, Zhang Yu was, after all, the company boss — and now a student in the Artifact Refinement Department. What did it matter if his Civil Engineering Department employees suffered a little humiliation? How could he possibly defy the university's policy and jeopardize his company's operations?

After all, what boss would risk everything to protect their employees?

Yet Zhang Yu, under the administrator's incredulous gaze, calmly stated, "My company's employees cannot be bullied."

The administrator's heart sank. He muttered inwardly, "Damn it... What's with this 'company employee' nonsense? You're probably just prejudiced against the monsterfolk from Celestial Monsters University, some kind of Human Race Immortal Dao supremacist."

Meanwhile, hearing Zhang Yu's words and seeing the towering double certificates behind him, Shi Huaiyu, Ying Xin, Shi Yunxiang, and the others unconsciously straightened their backs, feeling a surge of gratitude and confidence.

Zhang Yu then turned to the retreating monsterfolk. "Get lost. If I ever catch you harassing my employees again... I'll devour you all."

The monsterfolk yelped in terror, clutching their heads as they scattered like rats, vanishing from Zhang Yu's sight in an instant.

Watching this scene, the administrator sighed heavily. "President Zhang... Ah, why bother? It was just a minor incident. What if they report this to their teachers at Celestial Monsters University, sparking an Inter-University conflict? What happens when the university's higher-ups come down on us?"

Zhang Yu ignored the other party and turned to Ying Xin and the others, saying, "Perfect timing for a quick meeting. We need to discuss the company's future plans with you. Your workload might increase..."

Shi Huaiyu smiled. "Increased workload? That's great!"

Ying Xin nodded in agreement. As both a company worker and accountant, she knew better than anyone how generous Zhang Yu had always been with compensation.

During those times when project payments were delayed, Ying Xin knew Zhang Yu had personally covered the salaries out of his own pocket.

She was confident that even with increased workload, Zhang Yu would never skimp on overtime pay or raises.

Shi Yunxiang clenched his fist, his voice brimming with confidence. "Perfect! I've been feeling underworked lately, with all this energy to spare."

Since joining the company, thanks to the Tiger Wolf Medicine provided by Zhang Yu and Le Mulan, combined with his Profound Cold Magic Power, Shi Yunxiang had experienced a surge in work efficiency while simultaneously neutralizing the medicine's side effects.

Combined with Xiao Qingxuan's Ancient Medical Techniques and Yu Xinghan's massages, this multi-pronged approach had significantly improved his physical condition over the past few months. As a result, not only had his income increased, but his body no longer suffered the wear and tear it used to, becoming even healthier than before.

Of course, Xiao Qingxuan, Yu Xinghan, and Le Mulan also benefited from this arrangement, earning substantial additional income.

As Xiao Qingxuan looked at his colleagues, he couldn't help but reflect on how different things were now. In the past, he would never have dared to risk being caught by hospitals or pharmaceutical companies for charging for medical treatments.

He had always treated outsiders for free, but because Ancient Medical Techniques were widely distrusted, few people were willing to accept his free services.

It wasn't until after his battle with the Demonic Sect's Golden Core cultivator that he found trustworthy partners with whom he could charge for treatments.

*This isn't right...*

"We're sinking deeper into illegal territory..."

Xiao Qingxuan repeatedly told himself this, yet he couldn't resist the satisfaction of being part of this group, of charging for medical services and building bonds through healthcare fees.

"Old fool..." Xiao Qingxuan muttered inwardly, rubbing his head. "Your outdated thinking has really gotten me into a mess."

Zhang Yu then arranged for everyone to cooperate with the Heavenly Sun Radiance God in construction, determined to fully exploit the earning potential of this Level 20 military-grade puppet.

Witnessing Zhang Yu obtain dual certifications and introduce the Heavenly Sun Radiance God — a military-grade force — to the company, the team's morale soared. They eagerly anticipated the upcoming major project, ready to work tirelessly and earn massive profits.

---

A few days passed in tranquil calm.

Just as Zhang Yu was beginning to think the Celestial Monsters University students had given up causing trouble, someone approached him to inquire about the incident.

Zhang Yu learned that while the Celestial Monsters University students themselves dared not confront him directly, their teachers had raised a ruckus after hearing about it. They even went to the Finance Department teachers to file a complaint against Zhang Yu.

Lady Fortune remarked, "Heh, Celestial Monsters University is playing both sides now. I bet every monsterfolk in the school is looking for a chance to squeeze out some benefits. They're begging for handouts all the way to Myriad Laws University."

Just as Zhang Yu was preparing to handle the situation himself, he noticed that Celestial Monsters' teachers and students had suddenly stopped causing trouble, as if suppressed by an invisible force.

The next day, Zhang Yu learned that Bei Wufeng, the second-ranked student in the Artifact Refinement Department, had intervened. The invisible force that had silenced the monsterfolk was called Spirit Coin.

Though he disliked Bei Wufeng's method of throwing money at the problem, Zhang Yu still thanked him.

Bei Wufeng replied, "It was nothing, Junior Brother. I know you're a talented young man who can't stand these stinking monsters stirring up trouble in University City."

Bei Wufeng: But the overall situation takes precedence. Now is a critical moment for the university to win over Celestial Monsters. Even the slightest conflict could become leverage for them to demand more concessions, potentially costing the university dearly.

Bei Wufeng: Even if you despise them, at least pretend otherwise. Don't make it so obvious.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Does Bei Wufeng think I clashed with Celestial Monsters University students because I discriminate against monsterfolk? I may dislike their grotesque appearances, but when have I ever discriminated against them?"

"Well, discriminating against monsterfolk... is still better than caring for employees."

Zhang Yu understood that in this wretched place called Kunxu, the latter would attract far more attention and suspicion, even leading people to suspect he had joined some Demonic Sect.

Just then, Bei Wufeng sent another message: Junior Brother, there's something I'd like to discuss with you.

Bei Wufeng: Could I borrow your Heavenly Sun Radiance God?

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback. "Borrow a military-grade puppet? Is that something you can just casually lend out? It's practically the same as lending someone your physical body!"

As Zhang Yu was about to refuse, Bei Wufeng sent another message: 50 Spirit Coins per day. I'll cover all repair costs for any damage.

Zhang Yu was stunned. "Fifty Spirit Coins a day? Damn, you're rich... Why don't you borrow my physical body too? I'll charge you a hundred Spirit Coins a day."

Zhang Yu: Sure, when do you need it?

Bei Wufeng: I want to borrow your Heavenly Sun Radiance God for a few days during the next Ten Greats League.

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's initial enthusiasm instantly cooled like a bucket of cold water had been poured over him.

After reviewing the contract Bei Wufeng sent, Zhang Yu replied: Sorry, Senior, I can't lend it.

Bei Wufeng: Junior Brother, if there's anything in the contract you're not happy with, we can discuss it. Everything can be modified.

Zhang Yu: I really can't lend it.

Bei Wufeng: Oh, I see. Has Ye Xingli already asked to borrow it?

Bei Wufeng: Or Yan Qianji?

Zhang Yu's heart stirred as he read this, and he immediately understood.

"The school team has limited members, so they ask non-team members who own military-grade magical artifacts to lend them?"

"Bei Wufeng has been buttering me up just to borrow my Heavenly Sun Radiance God for the Ten Greats League."

Zhang Yu knew there was no point in deceiving him now.

After a moment's thought, he decided to drop the pretense and replied directly: Senior, I'm also planning to participate in the next Ten Greats League, so I can't lend it to you.
