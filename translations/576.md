# Chapter 576: The Simplest and Most Effective Method for Dealing with the Dual Rest Virus

After consulting with True Monarch Magnetic Pole and discussing the matter with Lady Fortune, Zhang Yu ultimately entrusted the task to True Person Ink Fiend.

He would still receive updates on the negotiation process and his input would be crucial in determining the final profit distribution.

True Person Ink Fiend's concerns about the time and effort required resonated with Zhang Yu.

Currently, Zhang Yu's entire focus was on preparing for the Ten Greats League, and he had no interest in wasting time on commercial negotiations.

After concluding his communication with the Investment Management Office, Zhang Yu's gaze shifted to the message floating in his Bionic Eye, a faint smile playing on his lips.

His new assistant was about to arrive.

Bei Wufeng's laboratory.

Liu Xiangqiao said, "Boss, I'm leaving."

Bei Wufeng tried to persuade her to stay. "Xiangqiao, you've been doing so well here. Why do you want to leave?"

Liu Xiangqiao interrupted him. "Doing well? How long have I been stuck doing menial tasks? I'm completely undervalued here! I don't want to keep living like this, working for you."

Bei Wufeng frowned slightly. Over the past few days, Liu Xiangqiao had suddenly become impatient, prone to outbursts, and had even clashed with other assistants, arguing and making a scene.

Initially, Bei Wufeng had assumed she was simply upset about losing money somewhere. He never imagined she would suddenly announce her withdrawal from the Project Team today.

Bei Wufeng couldn't help but say, "Once you leave, you won't be able to come back easily."

Liu Xiangqiao retorted, "Trying to threaten me again? How many times have you threatened me since I started working for you? But this time, I won't back down."

Bei Wufeng stared blankly at the scene, feeling like the woman before him had completely lost her mind.

However, an assistant who refused to follow instructions held little value for him, so Bei Wufeng ultimately let her go.

As soon as Liu Xiangqiao left the laboratory, she immediately messaged Zhang Yu: I'm here.

Zhang Yu: Did he notice?

Liu Xiangqiao: No.

Upon arriving at the laboratory, Liu Xiangqiao immediately reorganized the laboratory protocols, established new procedures, and created a schedule for personnel to use various equipment and instruments.

Zi Yunzhen, observing the new regulations, couldn't help but remark, "Isn't it enough to just complete the task? Why make things so complicated?"

Liu Xiangqiao replied calmly, "To go far on the path of artifact refinement, merely finishing the job isn't enough. You must do it correctly and perfectly."

"Previously, you prioritized efficiency, seeking speed and shortcuts, which led to neglecting essential procedural steps. Now that the project's scale is expanding — with eleven more Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords to refine — this approach won't work."

Initially, Liu Xiangqiao's changes caused a slight dip in the Project Team's efficiency, but it soon accelerated rapidly. Zhang Yu noticed that the assistants were becoming increasingly adept at assisting with the flying sword refinement process, affirming his decision to recruit them.

In the Dark Spirit Realm, Lady Fortune and Zhang Yu were exchanging intelligence with the Evil Gods.

They were particularly concerned about the Dual Rest Cult.

Whether it was the situation at the Vocational College or the Shui Haiyu incident, both Lady Fortune and Zhang Yu sensed that the Dual Rest Cult's influence was gradually spreading.

Lady Fortune complained, "Who's behind the Dual Rest Cult? They're proselytizing everywhere — it's utterly reckless."

The thousand-armed, thousand-legged Joy God's eyes flickered as he slowly replied, "Those Dual Rest Cult fanatics are truly insane. We've never seen such aggressive proselytizing before."

Lady Fortune countered, "To proselytize so brazenly within Myriad Laws University's territory, they must have inside help, right? Just like when you attacked University City last time."

The Joy God chuckled but remained silent.

Lady Fortune pressed, "What are they really after? Will this affect us?"

Hearing this, the Joy God's expression turned serious, clearly indicating his own concern.

He admitted, "To be honest, I don't know why the Dual Rest Cult is spreading so aggressively. But I do know they likely have ties to Myriad Laws University's Finance Department."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's heart stirred, recalling the last time the Evil God had asked them to gather intelligence on the Finance Department.

Could the unfamiliar accounts transferring money to the Finance Department be sending funds to the Dual Rest Cult? Zhang Yu wondered inwardly.

These guys are contacting the Dual Rest Cult and importing monster materials. What exactly are they planning?

As Zhang Yu pondered, the Joy God continued, "The Dual Rest Cult lunatics have even developed a so-called Dual Rest Virus and are intensifying its spread."

Lady Fortune's heart skipped a beat. "The Dual Rest Virus? Is that the same type we found in the Soul Transformation Bionic earlier?"

"It's more advanced now," the Joy God replied. "Besides dual cultivation, it can now spread through information exchange via Bionics. And after spreading through Bionics, it can infect human physical bodies, making it a troublesome thing."

"If it's a virus, there must be a way to block it, right?" Lady Fortune asked.

"The Dual Rest Virus is a type of Heart Demon," the Joy God explained. "Our Evil God Ritual should be effective against it. Moreover, the Righteous Gods are likely already developing an antidote."

"Of course, there's also the simplest method to combat the Dual Rest Virus, but it's one no one has used yet."

Lady Fortune asked curiously, "What method?"

"Raise salaries," Joy God replied. "Raise salaries, increase wages... This is an effective way to prevent the Dual Rest Virus. But so far, no company has been willing to do it. After all, setting such a precedent would have endless repercussions, enough to shake the heavens and earth."

"The Dual Rest Cult's actions have become utterly deranged."

Hearing Joy God's words, Zhang Yu couldn't help but think to himself, "Even the Evil Gods are dissatisfied with the Dual Rest Cult?"

Lady Fortune retorted, "Nonsense! If everyone's salaries were raised, who would still believe in their Unemployed Sect or Ascension Sect?"

Her expression turned solemn as she added, "The Dual Rest Cult's actions are like cutting off the fuel under the cauldron. They've offended companies, Righteous Gods, Evil Gods, and Demonic Sects all at once. They must be insane."

On the other side, Joy God continued, "Fortune God, the Dual Rest Cult's actions have become increasingly heinous. I've summoned you here today to propose a new collaboration. We must share intelligence on the Dual Rest Cult and ensure these fiends can no longer plague Kunxu."

Fortune God replied, "This is our duty."

Shortly after Zhang Yu completed his communication in the Dark Spirit Realm, he received new information about Shui Haiyu from Zhang Pianpian.

In the Supreme Clarity Realm, Zhang Pianpian said, "All records from the scene have been deleted."

"Whether it's surveillance footage or data from the Spirit Realm Network, everything has vanished without a trace."

"According to the investigation, it appears the Spirit Realm was hijacked."

Zhang Yu asked, "Does that mean the video Shui Haiyu sent me was fake?"

Zhang Pianpian shook her head. "I've examined the video. There's no evidence of editing."

"But even if the video hasn't been edited, that doesn't guarantee its authenticity. The content could still be fabricated."

"However, if the video is genuine..."

Zhang Pianpian frowned. "Then it means there's a massive vulnerability in the local Spirit Realm. Someone managed to seize Shui Haiyu's soul before the Righteous God could intervene."

Though Zhang Yu was deeply curious about this, he knew he didn't have time to investigate further. After exchanging information with Zhang Pianpian, he dove back into his laboratory.

A month later, it was June.

Inside the laboratory, Zhang Yu gazed at the twelve Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords before him, a hint of joy in his eyes.

After a month of relentless, overtime cultivation, he had finally refined the remaining eleven Level 20 flying swords.

Beside him, assistants like Liu Xiangqiao, Zi Yunzhen, and Su Yunni had witnessed Zhang Yu's meticulous refinement process step by step. Yet, as they now beheld the twelve perfectly aligned swords, their eyes still filled with awe.

Liu Xiangqiao thought to herself, "Even though we had already advanced the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword's Artifact Refinement Diagram to Level 20, completing the refinement of eleven swords in just over a month is still astonishingly fast."

At that moment, she couldn't help but feel grateful for her decision to join Zhang Yu's project. Not only was the project progressing at an astonishing pace, but it also allowed her to fully utilize her expertise, making her the second-in-command of a military-grade project.

She felt that working with Zhang Yu for a single month had been more fulfilling than a year under Bei Wufeng's command.

Next, Zhang Yu began assembling the sword formation, preparing for the final step in completing the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword.

A few days later, the results of the latest negotiations between the Investment Management Office and the Myriad Paths Group arrived.

"A buyout fee of 60 Spirit Coins, plus a 2% royalty?" Zhang Yu asked True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Ye Xingli. After confirming that this was indeed the best deal they could secure, he signed the contract.

Meanwhile, at a construction site in the wilderness, despite being near the Vocational College War Zone, the site was bustling with activity.

Reinforcing bars, cement, and dust filled the air as Shi Huaiyu, Xiao Qingxuan, and others worked tirelessly. A crimson figure flashed across the sky — the Heavenly Sun Radiance God assisting with the construction.

This was Zhang Yu Company's next major project.

As the Vocational College War intensified, various civil engineering projects essential for the war effort were launched one after another. The Civil Engineering Department at Myriad Laws University found itself swamped with increasingly lucrative opportunities.

Gradually, business trips became routine for Zhang Yu Company employees, each day spent striving to gather fragments of Zhang Yu's military-grade magical artifact.

Yu Xinghan had also come to the construction site with the project team that day. As a part-time employee, his duties included both physical maintenance and construction tasks.

But now he lay sprawled on the ground, his eyes listless, as if his former fighting spirit had been gradually drained from his body.

"It's over."

"I think I've caught the Dual Rest Virus."

"Damn it... who infected me?"

Yu Xinghan knew that contracting the Dual Rest Virus meant he would likely be sent to the Restraint and Rest Institute, wasting considerable time, and might even become a research subject for studying the virus.

If he were any other student at Myriad Laws University, he might have concealed his infection.

But as Yu Xinghan gazed at his comrades on the construction site — those with whom he had fought fiercely and committed crimes together — he finally sighed deeply, opened his friend list, and looked at the person he now trusted more than even his senior sister.

Yu Xinghan: Zhang Yu, I need to talk to you about something.
