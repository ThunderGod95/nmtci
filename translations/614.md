# Chapter 614: The True Power Move

On the floating continent, within the encampment of Heavenly Demon University, True Monarch Impermanence, the school team's instructor, questioned Kuang Tianqing: "What exactly happened? Given your strength, Zhang Yu shouldn't have been able to hold you back."

Kuang Tianqing sighed. "I've already uploaded the battle data."

"As I explained, after Zhang Yu transformed into a Living Stake, his physical strength reached an unbelievable level. After analyzing the time it would take to shatter him, I chose the final strategy."

"I don't think my decision at the time was flawed. The biggest problem was our intelligence failure. How could no one have known that the Living Stake technology of Myriad Laws University's Civil Engineering Department had advanced so dramatically?"

True Monarch Impermanence frowned. "According to our investigation, Myriad Laws University's Civil Engineering Department hasn't made such significant progress in this area..."

Kuang Tianqing: "But the facts speak for themselves."

True Monarch Impermanence: "Very well, I'll report this to higher authorities. Before the next match, we'll provide a counterstrategy and a magical artifact."

"However, we absolutely cannot afford such a devastating defeat again. You should understand the consequences this loss has had on the school and both of us."

Kuang Tianqing's heart sank as she heard these words, her mind involuntarily recalling the news reports she had seen:

"Kuang Tianqing Escapes Enemy Encirclement, Unable to Conceal Her Decline"
"Zhang Yu Dies with Dignity in the Arena, Displaying True Valor"
"Kuang Tianqing Speechless When Confronted by Reporters' Questions..."

Kuang Tianqing fully understood how much Zhang Yu had capitalized on her fame, and the losses she had suffered as a result. Only an absolute victory could salvage her reputation.

In the following days, Kuang Tianqing devoted herself entirely to her new cultivation regimen.

This was the nature of the Ten Greats League. Throughout the competition among the ten universities, each school continuously analyzed their opponents' Immortal Dao Technology, developing countermeasures and updating their magical artifacts and Bionics.

In Kuang Tianqing's mind, it was like an arms race.

By now, the Four Myriad Laws Schools had undoubtedly begun developing countermeasures against the latest iterations of her Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique and Heavenly Demon Void Technique.

Her side would likewise adapt based on the Four Myriad Laws Schools' advances.

As the Ten Greats League progressed, nearly every student's strength underwent further metamorphosis. Supported by their universities' resources, they relentlessly pushed forward, refining every aspect of themselves — from flesh and spirit to Bionics and magical artifacts — through repeated cycles of evolution.

Myriad Laws University.

True Person Ink Fiend of the Investment Management Office grew excited as he read the coverage of the Ten Greats League.

"Excellent, excellent!"

Thinking back to his previous collaboration with Zhang Yu on selling the copyrights to design blueprints, he felt immensely grateful that he hadn't hesitated.

He then received a message from the Myriad Paths Group, requesting Zhang Yu's cooperation in filming several promotional videos to boost sales of their artifact refinement products while the momentum was high.

True Person Ink Fiend readily agreed with a sly smile, confident that Zhang Yu would also approve. After all, the blueprint sales had included profit-sharing, meaning Zhang Yu's share would increase with higher sales.

In the Civil Engineering Department office, Director Gao watched Zhang Yu's interview without moving for a long time.

After a long silence, he sighed, "Good kid."

He sent Zhang Yu a message, first congratulating him on his achievements and then inquiring about his current situation.

Director Gao: Do you have enough money?

Zhang Yu: I do. I can start taking on commercials now.

Zhang Yu: Brother Dao has also been taking special care of me, sending me lots of things.

Director Gao: Have you run into any trouble?

Zhang Yu: Still not enough time. I haven't finished one of the military-grade magical artifacts I'm working on.

Zhang Yu: If I could just get another two months, it would be perfect.

After ending the communication with Zhang Yu, Director Gao thought to himself, "Ah, this Master can't help you much anymore."

But in the next moment, a glint of determination flashed in his eyes.

"I may not be able to help you, but someone else can."

"If all else fails, I'll just have to sell my reputation a little more."

In the laboratory, Director Gao had silently positioned himself beside True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

He gazed at her with a touch of melancholy. "Zhang Yu is a good kid," he said.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded slightly. "Old Gao, are you planning to give him money again?"

"Magnetic Pole, why don't you personally lend him a hand?" Director Gao replied.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole paused, then chuckled. "With his incredible Civil Engineering skills, he can win just by building houses. Why would he need my help?"

"Magnetic Pole, you know that's not what Zhang Yu means," Director Gao countered.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole snorted coldly. "Who in the Ten Great Universities doesn't know my, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's disciple, is the best at pouring concrete?"

Director Gao sighed. "But didn't he say the Yin Artifact Experiment helped him too?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole scoffed. "Do I need him to promote my work? Don't you know the groundbreaking potential of my project? The progress I've made in memory exchange? I..."

Director Gao patiently waited for her to finish, then pressed, "If the disciples we trained back then hadn't died, wouldn't they all be as outstanding as him now? Wouldn't they share the same deep bonds?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed. "Spare me the sentimentality."

After a pause, True Monarch Magnetic Pole added, "I could just give him some money, right?"

Director Gao replied, "Zhang Yu will have plenty of income soon. What he needs most isn't money."

Director Gao fixed True Monarch Magnetic Pole with a steady gaze. "Magnetic Pole, help him refine his artifact."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole blinked in surprise. "You want me to refine his artifact?"

"Do you even realize how critical my current work is? This concerns the entire Myriad Laws University's standing, the future of Myriad Laws, and even my Soul Transformation assessment..."

Director Gao countered, "Even the most critical work can spare a week or two, can't it?"

"Didn't Zhang Yu still have an unfinished military-grade magical artifact?"

"If it needs to be completed before the competition, you're the only one who can do it."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole snorted. "Spare me the flattery."

Director Gao sighed dramatically. "Ah, it's a pity I'm already old and my Immortal Dao Potential is long gone. I've achieved nothing significant in my life and can't even help Zhang Yu now..."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole relented with a sigh. "Alright, alright, stop it. I'll help him refine it."

"But I still need to charge him."

"I never refine artifacts for free, you know that's my bottom line."

"At most, I'll give him a slight discount."

As the school team's guiding teacher, True Monarch Tranquility was also responsible for managing the advertising arrangements for many of the team members.

After all, advertising brought in revenue, and revenue represented combat power. It propelled the members toward achieving results and was a crucial component of their overall strength, demanding True Monarch Tranquility's utmost attention.

However, arrangements for the other students had already been finalized, and everything was proceeding smoothly according to schedule.

Only Zhang Yu had soared to new heights this time. Starting as the underdog before the competition, he had surged to third place in the advertising valuation rankings, requiring a complete reassessment of his arrangements.

The news that Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution had taken a special interest in Zhang Yu further heightened True Monarch Tranquility's caution and meticulousness.

"I heard Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution is highly satisfied with Zhang Yu's performance and hopes he'll continue to excel, helping Dao Qiankun secure first place."

True Monarch Tranquility knew that the investment in Dao Qiankun had already reached saturation. While further upgrades to his Bionics and magical artifacts would continue as the competition progressed, the marginal returns on additional investment would diminish significantly.

At this stage, investing Spirit Coins in other team members would better support Dao Qiankun, further increasing his chances of victory.

This was the rationale behind the substantial investments made in Nine Heavens Liu, Yan Qianji, and Ye Xingli.

Recalling Zhang Yu's remarks during the interview, True Monarch Tranquility thought to himself, "That Zhang Yu kid must have seen this coming all along."

"Let's give Zhang Yu a larger commission."

The advertising revenue wasn't solely allocated to the students; the school, as both the students' manager and the advertising platform, also took a share.

However, the distribution ratio varied depending on the individual.

Furthermore, different advertising formats — such as video shoots, voice-overs, or placement on personal items — carried varying levels of impact.

Considering all this, True Monarch Tranquility decided to contact Zhang Yu directly to discuss the matter and solicit his insights.

True Monarch Tranquility: Student Zhang Yu, these are some of the most promising advertising projects we've identified after screening.

True Monarch Tranquility: Take a look and let me know which ones interest you most.

True Monarch Tranquility: Personally, I recommend move naming rights.

"Technique naming rights?"

Zhang Yu had been summoned by Dao Qiankun shortly before and was now soaking in a medicinal pool alongside him.

In the steaming heat, potent medicinal power continuously seeped into his body, rapidly healing his internal injuries, replenishing his depleted reserves, and even nourishing the damage to his dao heart.

Zhang Yu felt that if he could soak in this medicinal pool more often, his dao heart's damage would recover even faster, allowing him to burn the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology multiple times more frequently.

Turning to Dao Qiankun, Zhang Yu asked, "Brother Dao, what exactly are technique naming rights?"

Hearing Zhang Yu's question, Dao Qiankun, still immersed in the medicinal bath, leaned back and sighed, "Ah, so a corporation has set its sights on one of your techniques from the arena?"

"Zhang Yu, what kind of technique do you think is the strongest?"

"Some believe it's the one with the greatest destructive power, others prioritize speed, and still others prefer those that are impossible to defend against..."

"But those are all outdated notions from the past."

"Nowadays, the most widely regarded as the strongest techniques are undoubtedly those that can generate wealth, since Spirit Coins have become the universal currency."

"Technique branding works precisely this way, transforming the mundane into the extraordinary. It's a method to elevate a powerful technique to even greater heights."

"Once a technique is branded, every subsequent use under the specified conditions requires either reciting an advertising slogan or projecting an advertisement."

"Each use not only covers the basic activation cost but also generates additional referral fees. The most lucrative branded techniques even offer sales commissions."

"With such branded techniques, every use yields income, often far exceeding the expenditure. The more you use it, the more money you make. The stronger the technique, the more wealth it accumulates, making you increasingly formidable with each battle. This constant expansion of Immortal Dao Potential is the true measure of a truly powerful technique."

As he spoke, Dao Qiankun patted Zhang Yu on the shoulder and said, "Congratulations, you now have your own branded technique."

"This marks your true entry into the realm of the strong, starting today."
