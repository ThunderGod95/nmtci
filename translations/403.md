# Chapter 403: The Mysterious Zhang Yu

Wen Wuya's forced descent via Spirit Realm Projection was immediately noticeable, drawing the attention of many at the gathering.

Those who didn't recognize him wore expressions of curiosity.

Students who knew Wen Wuya as a Soul Transformation Disciple from Heavenly Sword University showed surprise.

Ma Xuan's gaze shifted to Wen Wuya's figure, and he privately messaged Su Yanyang beside him: "Isn't that one of the Soul Transformation Disciples from Heavenly Sword University who competed in the Flying Sword Tournament?"

Su Yanyang nodded, glancing at Wen Wuya before looking at Mo Shangjin in the distance. He remarked, "Mo Shangjin really has incredible Divine Power. He even managed to invite Wen Wuya to this gathering."

But as they watched Wen Wuya and Zhang Yu exchange glances, Su Yanyang's face showed surprise. "Are those two... communicating?" he wondered.

Ma Xuan privately messaged, "Wen Wuya... seems to be here to see Zhang Yu?"

Su Yanyang nodded slightly. "Maybe something's up?"

Across the room, Xiao Yunji was equally astonished. "What are Wen Wuya and Zhang Yu talking about?"

Xiao Yunji had already stood up. If Zhang Yu could strike up a conversation with Wen Wuya, there was no reason she couldn't do the same.

Ping Han, who had just left in disappointment, was drawn back again. A glint flashed in his eyes as he looked at Wen Wuya, thinking about getting him involved in cryptocurrency trading.

Gongshu Jin, who was receiving a massage, watched Zhang Yu and Wen Wuya standing together without surprise. After all, he had witnessed Wen Wuya specifically seeking out Zhang Yu after the Flying Sword Tournament.

Observing the puzzled and curious expressions of the seniors around him — all ranked higher and with more valuable Bionics than his own — Gongshu Jin suddenly felt a surge of smug satisfaction. He alone knew about the friendship between Wen Wuya and Zhang Yu.

"Speaking of which, Zhang Yu and I are friends, and Zhang Yu and Wen Wuya are friends. If I could get Zhang Yu to introduce us sometime, I could also have a Soul Transformation Disciple as a friend."

The thought filled Gongshu Jin with an inexplicable sense of superiority, as if he were the one standing beside Wen Wuya at that moment.

Meanwhile, on the other side, Yu Xinghan had already silently snapped dozens of photos of Zhang Yu and Wen Wuya.

He then looked at the mosaic in the photo with a regretful expression and said, "Damn rich bastards! They'd rather waste money on Evil-Warding Talismans than let us poor students get a little break."

In the next moment, under everyone's watchful eyes, a sudden change occurred in the arena.

"...Such audacity!"

Wen Wuya crushed the eavesdropping information hidden within Feng Tingting's Bionic Eye and began striding toward her.

With each step, a flurry of Talisman information flashed around him. Immobilization Talismans, Reporting Talismans, and Freezing Talismans activated one after another, terrifying Feng Tingting into a frozen state.

Just then, two figures stepped forward to block Wen Wuya's path, one in front of the other.

Mo Shangjin smiled faintly at Wen Wuya and said, "Fellow student Wen, why trouble a Righteous God over such a trivial matter?"

Ye Xingli added coldly, "Wen Wuya, this is Myriad Laws University, not your Heavenly Sword University. You have no right to act like a bully here."

Wen Wuya's gaze lingered on Mo Shangjin, and rows of data immediately appeared in his vision, including Mo Shangjin's ranking and his performance in various competitions over the years.

Then he turned his gaze to Ye Xingli, and a similar cascade of competition rankings and her master's identity appeared before his eyes.

Wen Wuya: "Ye Xingli... I know you. Disciple of True Monarch Magnetic Pole. You placed among the top five out of a hundred schools in the last Bionic Design Competition."

Simultaneously, Wen Wuya thought to himself, "True Monarch Magnetic Pole... Master said this person hides their true strength deeply. Even many at Myriad Laws University likely don't know. If a fourth Soul Transformation cultivator emerges from Myriad Laws University in the next twenty years, it will most likely be this person."

As Wen Wuya was merely a Spirit Realm Projection, capable of using only Talisman techniques, his presence already felt inferior to Ye Xingli's.

He studied Ye Xingli intently before asking, "Where's Yan Qianji? As Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations' disciple, he's the one in charge of the Artifact Refinement Department, isn't he?"

"Does he know you're covering up students' illegal activities?"

Ye Xingli met Wen Wuya's gaze without flinching, replying calmly, "This is a trivial matter. There's no need to trouble Senior Qianji. Besides, whether something is illegal isn't for you to decide. The Righteous Gods will gather evidence and judge."

In the next moment, their gazes clashed, as if an invisible force surged between them.

The surrounding students watched the pair, sensing an invisible clash between them.

Before Ye Xingli, Wen Wuya projected a series of characters invisible to the naked eye, dancing like fluttering insects.

Wen Wuya: "This is the eavesdropping record. I've already saved it."

Ye Xingli responded with the same projected script: "Are you sure you haven't made a mistake?"

Wen Wuya mentally scanned the eavesdropping data he had retrieved, only to find its contents completely erased.

His gaze toward Ye Xingli suddenly intensified with interest. "No fluctuations of divine power... Was this information erasure achieved through her Bionic? Has Ye Xingli's mastery of intelligent Bionics reached this level?"

Just then, Wen Wuya received a message from Bai Zhenzhen.

Bai Zhenzhen: "Wen Wuya, where are you?"

Wen Wuya: "Busy with some minor matters."

Bai Zhenzhen: "Start a call. I need to talk to you."

Wen Wuya: "Alright."

Wen Wuya: "Wait for me."

Wen Wuya: "Coming right now."

Wen Wuya glanced at Ye Xingli and Feng Tingting, snorted coldly, and projected to Ye Xingli: "I have urgent matters today. When my true form meets you in the future, we'll have a proper discussion."

He swiftly turned to Zhang Yu and whispered privately, "What kind of sterilization does Bai Zhenzhen prefer?"

Zhang Yu: "A-Zhen likes the extreme stuff."

Wen Wuya: "Like gender transformation?"

Wen Wuya: "Or human-sword unity?"

Zhang Yu thought, "Huh? Not my brother... Isn't that a bit too extreme?"

Wen Wuya: "Never mind. They're all easy anyway. I'll just try them all."

After exchanging a few glances with Zhang Yu, Wen Wuya's figure flickered slightly and vanished from the scene.

But just as he eagerly initiated a call request, the other party immediately hung up.

Bai Zhenzhen: "Why are you so late? I've already started sword practice. Just send me a message if you need anything."

Wen Wuya sighed inwardly, regretting not withdrawing his projection sooner.

At the party, Zhang Yu watched the chat history between Bai Zhenzhen and Wen Wuya, thinking, "Wen Wuya is such a pain. Only A-Zhen can keep him in check for now."

Su Yanyang, who had witnessed the entire exchange, mused, "Even from across vast distances, a mere projection carries such authority. Truly befitting a Soul Transformation Disciple."

"He and Ye Xingli must have had a secret clash in the Spirit Realm just now, otherwise he wouldn't have left so decisively."

"Judging by the outcome, he was ultimately just a Spirit Realm Projection. Against Ye Xingli, he was inevitably outmatched."

Ma Xuan whispered privately to Su Yanyang, "Senior, don't you think Wen Wuya and Zhang Yu seem quite close?"

Su Yanyang frowned, recalling the subtle exchanges between Wen Wuya and Zhang Yu. He was equally puzzled.

Meanwhile, Ping Han had already approached Zhang Yu again, pulling him along to meet Wen Wuya and discuss cryptocurrency trading.

The students from the Civil Engineering Department looked at Mo Shangjin with admiration, sharing news of his skillful mediation between the Soul Transformation Disciple and the Artifact Refinement Department.

Speculation about the mysterious relationship between Zhang Yu and Wen Wuya spread like wildfire through student groups, becoming one of the many gossip topics at Myriad Laws University.

Mo Shangjin smiled at Ye Xingli beside him. "Junior Ye, we owe you a great debt for resolving this matter today. Without you, this Soul Transformation Disciple might not have given me the same respect."

Feng Tingting, standing nearby, added, "Senior Sister, did you force him to retreat in the Spirit Realm just now?"

Ye Xingli frowned. "He's a direct disciple of a Soul Transformation cultivator, with vast resources. Even if he only used Talismans, causing trouble would be a headache, especially since I sensed a lingering battle intent in his mind before he suddenly left... I suspect the real reason he withdrew wasn't me."

Feng Tingting's heart jolted at her words.

Recalling Zhang Yu and Wen Wuya's conversation, and the meaningful glances they exchanged before Wen Wuya departed, she thought to herself, "Could Zhang Yu have persuaded Wen Wuya to leave?"

"If that's the case, Zhang Yu's status in Wen Wuya's eyes might be even higher than I initially thought."

Noticing Feng Tingting's shifting expression, Ye Xingli asked, "What's wrong?"

Seeing Feng Tingting's hesitation and Mo Shangjin's curious gaze, Ye Xingli created a group chat and typed: Tingting, do you know something?

Feng Tingting: "Wen Wuya and Zhang Yu seem to be in a dual cultivation relationship. Could Zhang Yu have persuaded him to leave just now?"

Hearing Feng Tingting's message, Ye Xingli's heart skipped a beat. "Is that true?"

She couldn't help but turn to look at Zhang Yu, wondering, "What exactly are his strengths? What benefits could dual cultivation with him possibly offer that would attract even Wen Wuya, a Soul Transformation Disciple?"

The thought that even Wen Wuya coveted the benefits of dual cultivation with Zhang Yu only deepened Ye Xingli's curiosity.

Then she remembered Director Gao's plan to transfer Zhang Yu to the Artifact Refinement Department, and she began to speculate whether there might be a connection between these two events. Her mind grew increasingly filled with questions and intrigue.

Beside her, Mo Shangjin thought in astonishment, "So that's it! There were rumors that Teacher Gao had connections to a Soul Transformation expert from Heavenly Sword. Could Zhang Yu be one of the channels for their communication?"

In that moment, the way both Ye Xingli and Mo Shangjin looked at Zhang Yu changed.

As the gathering concluded, Zhang Yu returned to his usual busy routine.

Time flew by, and before they knew it, it was late December.

Zhang Yu's Dao Heart Level had reached Level 16 (65.5%), his Magic Power had risen to 891.3, and his Magic Power Quality had reached 181%. His physical strength had also advanced to Level 16.95.

With this comprehensive progress, his Gang Qi conductivity had increased to 68%, and the maximum range for Gang Qi transmission had extended to 69 meters.

Zhang Yu's progress in martial arts was also significant. He advanced the Second Absolute of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering, the Great Wilderness Mountain-Shifting Force, to Level 20.

The seventh martial art of his Martial Dao Holy Body also reached Level 20, allowing him to begin cultivating the eighth.

Beyond these personal cultivation advancements, what truly delighted Zhang Yu was the progress brought about by the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo.

Through repeated testing and observation, he sensed that as the Divine Spiritual Root continued to refine his physical body, his frequently used techniques — the University Holy Body, Civil Engineering Holy Body, and Qi Meridian Everflow — retained approximately 1% of their effectiveness even in his normal state, without using the Chain Method Diagram Set.

Though only 1%, Zhang Yu hadn't forgotten that the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo's adaptive enhancement was a gradual process.

"Just one month, and it's already grown to 1%..." With this realization, Zhang Yu's anticipation for the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo's adaptive enhancement grew even stronger.

As for actively using it in combat like Bai Zhenzhen did, Zhang Yu currently dared not attempt such a thing.

When December transitioned into the new year of January, Director Gao's assignment for Zhang Yu's construction site was finally issued.
