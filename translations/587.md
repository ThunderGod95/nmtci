# Chapter 587: League Format and Qualification Battles

Hearing Zhang Yu's question, True Person Rising Sun quickly replied, "This person contacted me through a secret account. He's a top-ranked Heavenly Chosen student from the Finance Department."

"But he's just a pawn. The key is that he represents a high-ranking official within the Finance Department." Zhang Yu understood immediately that this official was the real target.

At this point, True Person Rising Sun gritted his teeth and said, "These bastards tried to silence me, sending assassins after me repeatedly. I nearly died at their hands."

"I came to you, young friend, to abandon the darkness and embrace the light, to help True Monarch Magnetic Pole deal with these parasites of the Myriad Laws."

Listening to True Person Rising Sun's words, Zhang Yu smiled faintly, then sighed, "Assassinating a Golden Core True Person? These bastards are truly mad with greed and arrogance."

"Rest assured, True Person," Zhang Yu continued. "We won't let these treacherous villains control Myriad Laws University. This time, my Master will ensure you receive justice."

After exchanging a few words with True Monarch Magnetic Pole, Zhang Yu introduced True Person Rising Sun to her.

However, in the following days, everything seemed to return to its original, uneventful state. Neither the Finance Department nor the Dual Rest Cult experienced any major incidents, much to Zhang Yu's surprise.

Lady Fortune, however, was unsurprised. She remarked, "Did you really think they would clash head-on, engage in a full-scale conflict, and resort to violence?"

"That's impossible. The Finance Department and the Artifact Refinement Department are the core of Myriad Laws University. If they truly tore apart their relationship, how would they continue to profit?"

"True Monarch Magnetic Pole has weathered countless storms; she understands this principle perfectly."

"Even if True Person Rising Sun has gained a slight advantage, she will undoubtedly resort to covert maneuvering rather than escalating the conflict. This allows her to control the intensity of the struggle, preserve cooperation for mutual benefit, and maintain flexibility in her strategies."

"This is what we call 'struggle without breaking, harmony with differences, competition without injury...'"

In the days that followed, Lady Fortune's words seemed to come true. No major conflicts erupted between the Finance Department and the Artifact Refinement Department.

However, news reports and rumors suggested that the struggle for dominance in certain areas never truly ceased.

As long as he wasn't directly involved, Zhang Yu paid little attention to the specific processes and actions.

With the Ten Greats League approaching in just over two months, Zhang Yu focused almost entirely on maximizing his strength.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole seemed to understand this, contacting Zhang Yu less and less, as if encouraging him to concentrate on his preparations.

Time flew by, and it was early July before they knew it.

In the laboratory, Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened as he absorbed the final strand of Calamity Qi, transforming it into a restriction within his Dantian.

Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon Level 11 (0/110)

"This cultivation art has now reached the Foundation Establishment stage," Zhang Yu murmured.

He then checked the notification in his Bionic Eye, which detailed the location and time of his upcoming match against Bei Wufeng.

---

Five hundred kilometers northwest of University City lay a mountainous region belonging to a Lower College. Due to the scarcity of Spirit Veins and depleted resources, it had gradually become a desolate wasteland used for live combat training.

Because space around Myriad Laws University was too precious, and Zhang Yu and Bei Wufeng's influence on the outside world was too formidable, their duel was arranged at this remote location.

In fact, the top 50 ranked students at Myriad Laws University often came here for various tests, drills, and experiments due to their extraordinary power.

At this moment, Zhang Yu and Bei Wufeng stood atop separate mountain peaks, thousands of meters apart, facing each other across the vast expanse.

Bei Wufeng's voice echoed through the Spirit Realm: "Junior Brother, are you still determined to challenge me?"

He lightly tapped the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword before him and added, "Regardless of the outcome, this battle will likely cost you dearly."

Zhang Yu replied earnestly, "Senior, I've already resolved to participate in this year's Ten Greats League."

Sensing Zhang Yu's resolve, Bei Wufeng smiled faintly and said, "Very well."

Turning to the third person present, Bei Wufeng asked, "Teacher, what kind of match would be most suitable for us?"

The teacher Bei Wufeng addressed was True Monarch Tranquility, Vice Director of the Dao Techniques Department and the school team's instructor. True Monarch Tranquility oversaw all aspects of the school team's training, investment, and strategic planning.

Today's challenge between Zhang Yu and Bei Wufeng, a battle for a spot on the school team, would be personally witnessed by True Monarch Tranquility.

Of course, besides True Monarch Tranquility, other teachers and school leaders would also remotely observe the duel through the Spirit Realm.

Hearing Bei Wufeng's question, True Monarch Tranquility replied, "Official registration for the Ten Greats League has begun. The next few days are the final opportunity to confirm the school team roster."

"The revised competition format and general content for this year's Ten Greats League have also been announced. It will begin with team matches to eliminate some participants, followed by individual competitions to determine the Ten Greats."

"Throughout this process, team strength will be paramount, potentially determining the entire competition's outcome."

"If you two wish to compete for a school team spot, you must prioritize the Ten Greats League's requirements and focus on the school team's overall strength."

"Bei Wufeng's role on the school team is to handle Flying Sword Communication."

"Zhang Yu, if you want to claim a spot, defeat Bei Wufeng in the Sword Duel."

From the school's perspective, the final individual competition would be decided by the three strongest students: Dao Qiankun, Nine Heavens Liu, and Yan Qianji. The rest of the school team members were primarily there to support these three in the team competitions, conserving their strength for the main event.

Therefore, True Monarch Tranquility believed that Bei Wufeng's role required exceptional technical skill and the ability to support the team effectively.

Hearing the competition format, Bei Wufeng exuded confidence, smiling faintly. "Just a Sword Duel? Good. At least we won't have to waste resources on a full-scale battle."

"I wonder if Junior Brother agrees to this?"

As he spoke, both Bei Wufeng and True Monarch Tranquility turned to look at Zhang Yu.

In their eyes, Zhang Yu would naturally be at a disadvantage facing Bei Wufeng, who had honed his skills for years, in a single Sword Duel.

True Monarch Tranquility thought to himself, "If Zhang Yu refuses to limit the competition to a Sword Duel..."

"I agree," Zhang Yu replied calmly, as if he had anticipated this. "Then let's have a Sword Duel."

A flicker of surprise crossed True Monarch Tranquility's usually expressionless face as he turned to study Zhang Yu intently.

Bei Wufeng also glanced at Zhang Yu with surprise. "Junior Brother, do you still remember our agreement?"

"Of course I remember," Zhang Yu nodded. "The loser has to lend their military-grade magical artifact to the winner for free to use in the Ten Greats League."

Zhang Yu and Bei Wufeng had signed a contract about this matter back then, so he couldn't possibly forget.

Bei Wufeng continued, "Now that we've decided on the competition format, let's sign a supplementary agreement to clarify the victory conditions and other details..."

Hearing Bei Wufeng's words, Zhang Yu understood that his opponent was afraid he might refuse to accept defeat in the Sword Duel and demand a different competition format to determine the outcome.

"No problem," Zhang Yu said. "Senior, you draft the contract."

True Monarch Tranquility watched the two sign the agreement without intervening. In his view, if Bei Wufeng could secure Zhang Yu's military-grade magical artifact for free, it would significantly strengthen the school team's capabilities, which would be beneficial for their upcoming participation in the Ten Greats League.

After signing the contract, Bei Wufeng let out a sigh of relief. He gently tapped his sword casket, and twelve flying swords leaped out in succession, arranging themselves neatly behind him.

"Junior Brother, let's begin."

Zhang Yu nodded, placing his hand lightly on his own sword casket. Twelve flying swords soared into the sky, their Sword Intent surging forth, all aimed at Bei Wufeng's position.

"Begin."

The rules for this Sword Duel were simple.

First, neither combatant could use any magical artifacts other than the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation and their own Bionics.

Second, the battle area was limited to a ten-mile radius. Any flying sword or combatant that crossed the boundary would be considered defeated.

Finally, the first flying sword to penetrate within ten meters of the opponent's position would win the duel.

In an instant, sword light flashed across the sky as both combatants deployed their sword formations and clashed.

Bei Wufeng's right hand clenched, his fingers forming a sword seal. The Great Sky Sword Realm materialized within his sword formation, rapidly expanding and pressing toward Zhang Yu's position.

Faced with Bei Wufeng's Great Sky Sword Realm, Zhang Yu remained calm. He formed his own sword seal and released his Great Sky Sword Realm to meet the oncoming force.

As the two Sword Realms collided violently, the Spirit Realm was continuously compressed outward. Crackling explosions echoed through the air, and the Spirit Realm signal within a several-mile radius plummeted to its lowest level.

Bei Wufeng smiled faintly. "Junior Brother, your flying sword is well-refined, but a Sword Duel is more than just comparing the quality of flying swords."

As he spoke, Bei Wufeng pointed skyward, then clenched his fist sharply, as if tearing at the Spirit Realm above.

In that instant, countless streams of Spirit Realm energy converged, surging into his Great Sky Sword Realm like a vortex.

In an instant, the Great Sky Sword Realm and the Spirit Realm, which had been previously pushed aside, seemed to merge into one, enveloping Zhang Yu's Sword Realm.

Bei Wufeng was confident of victory in this Sword Duel. Knowing that many teachers and leaders were watching the match, he couldn't resist showing off.

As he manipulated the Spirit Realm, he explained, "Junior Brother, this is the Celestial Cycle Spirit Acceleration Technique. It opens a conduit to my hidden cave deep within the Spirit Realm, accelerating the flow of spiritual energy."

"Now that I've activated it, my Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation is empowered by the Spirit Realm. How can your Sword Realm possibly withstand it?"

In the blink of an eye, Zhang Yu felt the combined power of Bei Wufeng's Sword Realm and the Spirit Realm closing in like a giant hand, threatening to completely seal off his Sword Realm and sever his connection to his flying swords.

Zhang Yu knew that in a simple contest of Sword Realms or Spirit Realm techniques, he stood no chance against his opponent. He had prepared for this eventuality.

With a calm demeanor, Zhang Yu stated, "Senior, a Sword Duel ultimately comes down to the sword itself."

With a soft *pop* as Zhang Yu's fingers tightened into a fist, the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power activated, unleashing a torrent of Earthly Fiend Gravity.

The twelve Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords hummed in unison under the influence of the Earthly Fiend Gravity, ignoring the fierce struggle within the Spirit Realm as they physically lunged toward Bei Wufeng's flying swords, aiming to crush them.
