# Chapter 705: Zhang Yu's Fingertips

Yu Xinghan: Zhang Yu, I just arrived and had a brief chat. For now, she seems safe.

Seeing Yu Xinghan's message, Zhang Yu understood that Yu Xinghan had reached the vicinity of Heavenly Sword University's campus and used Lady Fortune's power to communicate with Bai Zhenzhen telepathically.

Ever since Lady Fortune's Evil God Power had surged, he, Yu Xinghan, and Bai Zhenzhen, as her believers, could communicate telepathically across vast distances.

However, the distance between Zhang Yu's location in the Third Layer's Grand Void and Bai Zhenzhen's location at Heavenly Sword University in the Second Layer far exceeded the range of their telepathic connection.

With Zhang Yu currently overwhelmed by various matters, he had simply asked Yu Xinghan to make a trip to Heavenly Sword University and relay messages to Bai Zhenzhen on his behalf.

While confirming Bai Zhenzhen's temporary safety, Zhang Yu continued working on his magical artifact designs.

Two design blueprints floated before him. One was for the Great Void Cloud Repository, now enhanced with a "locking function" that would completely isolate its interior once activated, making it nearly impossible to open without the correct unlocking password.

The other blueprint showed Zhang Yu's modified Great Void Cloud Repository with an added Anti-Gravity function. After merging the design blueprints for the Great Void Cloud Repository and the Anti-Gravity magical artifact, he incorporated his understanding of Earthly Fiend Gravity and Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, enabling the Great Void Cloud Repository to reduce the weight of stored items.

"The Anti-Gravity function needs further enhancement..."

As Zhang Yu studied the second blueprint, he activated the power of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology once more. Instantly, countless streams of knowledge surged before his eyes, rapidly combining and coalescing, ultimately converging onto the blueprint before him.

"Anti-Gravity shouldn't just reduce the weight of stored items; it should also allow the Great Void Cloud Repository to fly and move."

Fueled by the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology's deductions, Zhang Yu's mind seemed to unleash a torrent of Spirit Inspiration. His fingertips danced frantically across the Spirit Realm Projection before him, and a brand-new design blueprint gradually materialized.

Throughout this process, his dao heart burned fiercely, eventually diminishing to Level 36 (18.44%).

Zhang Yu exhaled deeply, nodding slightly as he examined the design blueprint before him. "The anti-gravity function meets the requirements."

"Next..."

He activated the power of his Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart, burning Spirit Inspiration to synthesize the two blueprints containing the "Spatial Lockdown" and "Anti-Gravity" functions.

"By combining these two core functions, the Great Void Cloud Repository can be sealed at any time, allowing it to complete its transportation missions."

But as he studied the synthesized blueprint, Zhang Yu frowned slightly. "The anti-gravity performance has been compromised, and the spatial capacity has decreased..."

"Moreover, for flight, we'll need to add a positioning module..."

He was forced to burn his dao heart again, channeling the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology to optimize and refine the design blueprint.

During this process, two critical choices presented themselves to Zhang Yu:

Should he maintain the original appearance, allowing the Great Void Cloud Repository to achieve flight?

Or should he completely transform its form into a flying sword mode, enabling the Great Void Cloud Repository to fly?

"A flying sword is indeed better suited for long-distance flight, but the costs would increase, the volume would expand, and maintenance expenses would rise."

"If we keep the original design, the flight performance will be slightly weaker, but the cost will be lower and maintenance will be simpler."

As Zhang Yu pondered this, his gaze swept over the data on Heavenly Sword University's various industries.

As a seasoned magical artifact designer, he naturally couldn't focus solely on performance and functionality when creating his designs. He also needed to consider the current state of the industry and the challenges of mass production.

"To mass-produce flying swords, we'll inevitably need to collaborate with Heavenly Sword University. After all, they can offer the lowest prices and the largest production capacity in this field."

"We'll likely need to contact many of Heavenly Sword University's factories."

"If we don't adopt the flying sword form, we can simply import positioning modules from Heavenly Sword University, Vajra University, or Immortal Armaments University."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "There are many manufacturers capable of producing positioning modules, so we won't face the risk of relying on a single component supplier."

"From both a commercial perspective and a production risk standpoint, sticking with the original design is clearly the better choice."

"Moreover..."

Zhang Yu glanced at the company under Divine Monarch Blade Commander's name. "It can also conveniently resolve a certain trouble."

With this thought, he made up his mind.

After Zhang Yu quickly weighed the pros and cons and made his decision, he began to consider other design and component issues. While determining which manufacturers, schools, and Soul Transformation cultivators to collaborate with, he continuously refined the design blueprint.

Each decision Zhang Yu made regarding the design caused his fingertips, as they moved across the blueprint, to stir up a tempestuous storm that would sweep across all directions.

This storm, in the future, would impact hundreds of manufacturers, countless upstream and downstream enterprises, millions or even tens of millions of related workers, and even the immortal paths of Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs.

Zhang Yu understood that this was the terrifying influence that came with mastering advanced Immortal Dao Technology and leading societal development.

Throughout the process, as his fingertips lightly traced the design blueprint, resolving Bai Zhenzhen's troubles was merely a convenient side effect.

As Zhang Yu continued to burn his dao heart and Spirit Inspiration, design blueprints for the Great Void Cloud Repository appeared before him, one after another.

While Zhang Yu focused on the locking and Anti-Gravity functions, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole worked on the other side, modifying the design blueprints to add spatial layering capabilities to the Great Void Cloud Repository.

This spatial layering effect would divide the interior of the Great Void Cloud Repository into distinct zones, allowing items to be categorized and arranged for easy retrieval.

Ultimately, the designs from both sides would need to be combined, further optimized, and refined to perfect the Great Void Cloud Repository's overall performance.

During this process, Zhang Yu's dao heart continued to burn, gradually depleting to Level 35 (29.18%).

Though he felt a deep sense of exhaustion in his mind, Zhang Yu felt a sense of satisfaction as he gazed at the newly completed design blueprints.

"Finally, I've perfectly integrated the locking and Anti-Gravity functions."

Shortly after sending the blueprints to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, she replied with a message: "You're planning to do logistics and transportation? Like express delivery?"

The new generation of Great Void Cloud Repositories utilizes anti-gravity technology for high-speed flight and spatial lock protection, enabling them to complete various logistics tasks without the need for hired cultivators for security.

Magnetic Pole thought to herself, "Since the Great Upheaval, the operational costs for all industries have been rising. This is because the absence of comprehensive oversight from Righteous Gods has allowed illegal and criminal activities to persist despite repeated bans."

"The logistics sector is particularly affected. What used to require only a Flying Boat and a group of Soul Cultivators now necessitates hiring cultivators as security, increasing the cost of each shipment."

"However, the Great Void Cloud Repository's Spatial Lockdown significantly enhances cargo security, eliminating the need for hired cultivators. Applying this to the current logistics industry would be a game-changing advantage."

When Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole asked Zhang Yu about his intentions, he replied, "I want to create a Shared Space Pouch."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Continue."

As Zhang Yu elaborated, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's eyes gradually brightened. She sensed that his idea and plan held immense potential.

She replied, "This undertaking is too vast for our family alone. Judging by your design blueprint, you intend to collaborate with Vajra University and Heavenly Sword University?"

Zhang Yu: "Exactly."

Zhang Yu: "Especially Heavenly Sword University. Many of their factories are struggling to survive, facing imminent closure due to a lack of orders. This makes them perfect targets for us to drive down prices."

After this conversation with her disciple, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed inwardly.

"Zhang Yu isn't just inheriting my mantle in magical artifact design; he also possesses remarkable business acumen. Unlike Old Gao, who's rigid and only knows how to do one thing and earn one kind of profit, Zhang Yu thinks outside the box."

In Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's view, those who work only for what they earn are the least talented in the Immortal Dao.

A true Heavenly Chosen of the Immortal Dao should earn ten times the profit for one unit of effort, or even generate wealth without working at all.

Zhang Yu's growing display of Immortal Dao talent reassured Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole that her efforts in nurturing him had not been in vain.

With this in mind, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "I'll gather the relevant parties. Come with me to the negotiations."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole thought to herself, "It's time for Zhang Yu to gradually step into the spotlight and participate in the university's affairs."

---

Kunxu's efficiency had always been remarkable, and the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs from various universities were even faster.

Just over an hour after Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Zhang Yu finished their discussion, the mental projections of numerous Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs had already converged in the Spirit Realm Conference Room.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander, as the vice-principal of Heavenly Sword University, was among those invited.

Upon arriving at the Spirit Realm Conference Room, he saw several familiar Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs already present.

"Myriad Laws, Vajra, and Heavenly Sword," Divine Monarch Blade Commander mused inwardly. "Magnetic Pole has gathered the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs from these three universities. What scheme is she plotting now?"

He glanced at Principal Divine Monarch Shattering Glory, who had also come from Heavenly Sword University.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander knew that Principal Divine Monarch Shattering Glory was a veteran cultivator of Heavenly Sword University, bearing many traces of ancient cultivation practices.

For example, his Dao Title, Shattering Glory, had originally been Shattering Monsters. However, after the Heavenly Court enacted the Dao Title Management Act, he was forced to change it to Shattering Glory.

It was precisely because of his long-standing seniority, profound foundation, and ability to adapt to the times and trends that Principal Divine Monarch Shattering Glory had been selected by the Heavenly Court to become the new principal of Heavenly Sword University after the Great Upheaval.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander asked, "Principal, why has Magnetic Pole summoned us all here? Does she intend to rally our support against the Heavenly Demons, Immortal Soldiers, and Netherworld's spatial products?"

Divine Monarch Shattering Glory replied calmly, "The design for the next generation Great Void Cloud Repository is likely nearing completion. Magnetic Pole probably called us here to discuss component procurement and manufacturing partnerships."

As they spoke, the Spirit Realm Projections of the Soul Transformation cultivators from the three universities materialized in the conference room.

What surprised Divine Monarch Blade Commander most was the figure beside Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole — the only non-Soul Transformation cultivator present.

Seeing that figure, Divine Monarch Blade Commander thought to himself, "Zhang Yu? Magnetic Pole actually brought him here?"

Before he could ponder further, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole began, "I've gathered you all today to discuss the Great Void Cloud Vault Second Generation."

"Zhang Yu, please distribute the product specifications to everyone."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander glanced at the product specifications before him, initially unimpressed. After all, space pouches... they were all pretty much the same, he thought. Each manufacturer simply focused on different features, excelling in their own areas.

But after a moment, Divine Monarch Blade Commander's expression grew increasingly solemn.

At the same time, Zhang Yu on the stage announced, "Divine Monarchs, current space pouch products have consistently failed to effectively address security concerns."

"Particularly due to the space pouches' large storage capacity, many criminals have targeted them for theft. The number of space pouch robbery cases is increasing daily."

"Ensuring the security of the vast wealth stored within space pouches has become a paramount concern for every user."

"The first key feature of the Great Void Cloud Vault Second Generation is security."

"Without the correct password, the locked space cannot be opened. Multiple incorrect password attempts or attempts at forced entry will trigger the Great Void Cloud Vault's internal restrictions, automatically activating alarms, positioning modules, and initiating a 24-hour freeze state, rendering the spatial barrier impenetrable for 24 hours."

"While ensuring security, the Great Void Cloud Vault's Anti-Gravity function significantly enhances weight-bearing capacity and provides flight capabilities."

"In the past, even with the largest space pouches, weight restrictions prevented cultivators, especially those at lower levels, from storing too many items."

"But the Anti-Gravity function allows lower-level cultivators to store items without restraint, removing the final barrier to universal space pouch adoption."

"Furthermore, by utilizing the Great Void Cloud Vault Second Generation's flight capabilities, any user can launch the vault to a target location, transporting goods freely in the safest and most efficient manner."

"In addition to the personal version, this iteration of the Great Void Cloud Vault will also heavily promote a shared version."

"Our goal is to deploy Great Void Cloud Vaults of varying sizes and specifications across all campuses of the Ten Great Universities and every street corner."

"We aim to enable all Qi Refining Cultivators, Foundation Establishment cultivators, Golden Core Cultivators, Nascent Soul Cultivators, and Soul Transformation Cultivators to rent and use the Great Void Cloud Vaults, allowing them to store, retrieve, and transport items anytime, anywhere."

"The entire logistics system of the Ten Great Universities will undergo a revolutionary transformation, making the flow of resources simpler than ever before..."

As Zhang Yu continued his explanation, Divine Monarch Blade Commander grew increasingly alarmed.

"Safety, load capacity, flight... Once these issues are resolved, the user base for space pouches will explode."

"The existing logistics methods — Flying Boats, flying swords, and so on — will suffer a devastating blow and be completely replaced by the Great Void Cloud Repository."

While alarmed, Divine Monarch Blade Commander felt even more anxious. He couldn't find his own position in the product description.

On the contrary, several of his logistics and courier companies were likely to be severely impacted.

In stark contrast, Divine Monarch Shattering Glory beside him had eyes gleaming with excitement, as if he could already see an unprecedentedly vast market beckoning him.

The positioning modules produced by several of his companies were precisely the components needed for the Great Void Cloud Repository.

Divine Monarch Shattering Glory thought to himself, "Shared Great Void Cloud Repository... Shared Space Pouch. Once this thing is perfected, how many Great Void Cloud Repositories will need to be produced annually? Hundreds of thousands? Millions? Tens of millions?"

"Moreover, the existing logistics system will be revolutionized. The future annual demand for the Great Void Cloud Repository... will likely far exceed the combined production capacity of all space pouches today."

"What a massive piece of meat this is!"

"If I could provide positioning modules for the Great Void Cloud Repository..."

However, Divine Monarch Shattering Glory knew he wasn't the only Soul Transformation cultivator present capable of producing positioning modules.

With this realization, a powerful surge of fighting spirit welled up within him. He resolved... to secure the Great Void Cloud Repository contract at all costs.

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Sword Reverence, also from Heavenly Sword University, wore a solemn expression.

In his youth, this Divine Monarch had followed Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, immersing himself in the practice of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao.

But he soon realized that the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao was a Demonic Path within the Sword Dao, and he sought to correct his course.

Fortunately, his investment in the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao had been shallow. After returning to the Dual Cultivation Path, he quickly severed all ties with the Demonic Path and embarked on the path of channeling extreme emotion into the sword.

"The reason the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao fails is because humans are unreliable."

"Unlike humans, who are fickle, uncontrollable, prone to betrayal, and capable of stabbing you in the back..."

"Sword Spirits are humanity's best companions."

From that day forward, he cultivated with Sword Spirits as his dual cultivation partners, focusing not on physical intimacy but on mental and spiritual resonance. His devotion lay with the sword, not with people.

Now, his personal Sword Repository housed over a thousand life-sized sword artifacts, each a cherished Sword Spirit unique to him. Every one was the love of his life, his Extreme Emotion Sword.

Divine Monarch Sword Reverence's solemn expression stemmed from the fact that his company produced the positioning modules for the Great Void Cloud Repository, allowing him to participate in this transformative project.

Besides Divine Monarch Shattering Glory and Divine Monarch Sword Reverence, the remaining two Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs from Heavenly Sword University were also deeply stirred, their minds racing with excitement.

Shortly after the conference concluded, the five Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs of Heavenly Sword University gathered for a private meeting.

Divine Monarch Shattering Glory: "Everyone, Heavenly Sword must secure the order for the Great Void Cloud Vault Second Generation."

Divine Monarch Sword Reverence: "Agreed. Securing this order will undoubtedly reverse our university's current decline. To achieve this, we must unite and avoid internal strife. Our true rivals are those flesh-peddling brutes from Vajra University..."

Watching the four Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs excitedly discussing their plans, Divine Monarch Blade Commander felt utterly out of place, both anxious and helpless. Despite his vast network of industries, he couldn't find a way to capitalize on the massive Great Void Cloud Repository deal. In fact, his logistics company might even face a string of losses.

He felt like a Qi Refinement Kid staring at a table piled high with excrement — able to see it but unable to eat it, his stomach churning with the urge to evacuate. It was a crushing loss.

Suddenly, his gaze sharpened as Divine Monarch Shattering Glory declared, "I plan to dedicate all our production lines to manufacturing positioning modules for the Great Void Cloud Repository..."

The other Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs chimed in, each announcing their targeted share of the lucrative market and the production capacity they intended to allocate.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander interjected, "Principal, my flying sword factories also need your positioning modules, as well as navigation modules..."

Divine Monarch Shattering Glory waved his hand dismissively. "Blade Commander, the school's focus is now entirely on the Great Void Cloud Repository. Your factories will have to temporarily suspend operations."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander froze, his mind racing with the potential losses from halting production. "How can we possibly shut down the factories?" he blurted out.

Divine Monarch Shattering Glory frowned. "Blade Commander, your factories are university assets and must operate in accordance with the university's overall plan. Now that the university faces difficulties, it's time for us to work together. Please bear with this temporary inconvenience and cooperate with the university's efforts."

Divine Monarch Sword Reverence nodded vigorously. "The promotion of the Great Void Cloud Vault Second Generation is clearly the prevailing trend. Anyone who tries to swim against the tide will be going against everyone."

He turned to Divine Monarch Blade Commander. "Blade Commander, you cultivated all the way to Soul Transformation. You should know that the path of the Immortal Dao requires adapting to the current trends. You must never defy the greater good."

Another Soul Transformation cultivator nodded in agreement. "Blade Commander, you're a Soul Transformation cultivator now. Show some integrity and don't hinder the university's progress for the sake of your personal assets."

Under the intense gazes of the four Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, Divine Monarch Blade Commander felt his numerous assets both within and outside Heavenly Sword University being targeted by various Spirit Realm signals. His companies, factories, and accounts were all being subjected to inspections and risk assessments.

If the Spirit Realm Projection in the conference room was merely a projection of Divine Monarch Blade Commander's consciousness, then his true form lay in his vast network of assets scattered throughout the university and beyond.

At that moment, each of his assets was being locked onto by Spirit Realm signals, scrutinized by warnings and notifications. He felt as if four Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs were gently pressing down on him, ready to unleash a barrage of sanctions at the slightest sign of resistance.

Overwhelmed by this suffocating pressure, Divine Monarch Blade Commander's scattered consciousness throughout the Spirit Realm stirred faintly.

"Those four... they'd already decided to join forces before even meeting me."

"Well, they can clearly see what meat they'll get to eat this round, so they can also see I'll get nothing..."

But Divine Monarch Blade Commander understood that he stood no chance against the four Soul Transformation cultivators from his own university.

Gritting his teeth, he said, "I understand. I'll cooperate with the university's plan and arrange for the shutdown..."

"There's more," said Divine Monarch Shattering Glory, the principal of Heavenly Sword University. "Myriad Laws University is deeply concerned about our credibility."

Staring at the four Soul Transformation cultivators, Divine Monarch Blade Commander paused slightly. "Credibility?"

Divine Monarch Shattering Glory replied calmly, "Regarding the recent handling of Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' Sword Repository, false rumors have been circulating, each more absurd than the last."

Divine Monarch Sword Reverence interjected calmly, "Some leaders at Myriad Laws University, after hearing rumors that we were forcibly dismantling the Sword Repository, have expressed concerns about our lack of integrity and commercial credibility, worrying about the business environment at Heavenly Sword University."

Divine Monarch Shattering Glory sighed. "Blade Commander, the Sword Repository of Divine Monarch Seven Emotions is a legacy from our predecessors. Didn't I tell you to handle this with utmost caution?"

"Yet you resorted to violent demolition, sword artifact self-destruction, and even detained disciples, creating chaos and severely damaging our reputation."

"How many officials abused their power for personal gain? How many violated the law for selfish motives?"

"Let me make this clear: nothing disgusts me more than those who exploit their authority to bully others and seek personal gain."

"Blade Commander, this matter must be handled with the utmost seriousness. Anyone who thinks they can get away with this will soon discover whether their connections are stronger than the regulations of Heavenly Sword University."

As Divine Monarch Shattering Glory spoke, Divine Monarch Blade Commander's gaze swept across the four Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs present, a bitter smile forming in his heart.

Moments later, he sent a message to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, only to find it redirected to Zhang Yu.

The message explained that Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole was occupied with urgent matters and had temporarily delegated communication to Zhang Yu.
