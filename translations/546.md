# Chapter 546: Sliding to His Knees

When Zhang Pianpian heard Zhang Yu's words, she immediately suspected he was seeking revenge against Feng Yuhuan. However, she doubted the value of such an action.

But then Zhang Yu continued, "Senior Sister, don't you find Feng Yuhuan suspicious? How could one person single-handedly fight off Demonic Sect members? Is his combat prowess really that extraordinary? Could he have been infiltrated by the Demonic Sect?"

"I'm not targeting him personally," Zhang Yu insisted. "I just think there might be something genuinely wrong with him, and I'm worried he could endanger Myriad Laws University."

Zhang Pianpian's gaze flickered slightly. Though she still believed Zhang Yu was simply trying to find fault with Feng Yuhuan out of spite, she had to admit there was some truth to his concerns.

Just as Zhang Pianpian hesitated, Zhang Yu sighed dramatically. "Ah, well, if Senior Sister won't help, then forget it."

That evening, Yu Xinghan returned to their dorm and announced, "Zhang Yu, I found those discount coupons you wanted me to keep an eye out for. See if they work for you."

"Speaking of which, your Time-Worn Demonic Eye was top-tier back in high school, but you've been using it for nearly five years now. It's about time for an upgrade."

Zhang Yu replied, "I have so many expenses. If it weren't starting to lag, I'd keep using it for at least another year."

Hearing this, Zhang Pianpian recalled how Zhang Yu had scrimped and saved to lend her 150 Spirit Coins.

Remembering the bond between siblings and the repayment she had to pause due to her recent financial crisis, Zhang Pianpian sighed helplessly and sent Zhang Yu a message.

Zhang Pianpian: Fine, I'll look into it for you.

The next day, a report appeared before Zhang Yu.

In addition to Feng Yuhuan's basic data, it included detailed records of his solo battle against the Demonic Sect disciples.

Zhang Pianpian analyzed, "At first glance, everything seems fine, but it's just... too clean."

She mused, "Especially the battle scene. The traces are too simple and match Feng Yuhuan's account perfectly."

"But even a Nascent Soul True Monarch, after a grueling battle against numerous Demonic Sect disciples, could really remember every detail so clearly and accurately?"

"The scene almost looks like it was... staged according to his story."

Zhang Pianpian said, "You're right. This Feng Yuhuan is definitely suspicious."

"But it's only a slight suspicion. It's hard to prove anything."

---

Dark Spirit Realm.

The Joy God, with his thousand hands and feet, emerged from the darkness and stood in the conference room.

He gazed at the combined form of Lady Fortune and Zhang Yu before him and said calmly, "Fortune God, what do you need me for?"

Lady Fortune replied evenly, "Joy God, what are the three most important things for us Evil Gods?"

"What are you getting at?" the Joy God asked.

"The first thing is safety," Lady Fortune continued. "The second thing is safety."

"And the third thing is still safety."

Lady Fortune fixed her gaze on the Joy God. "But what you're doing now is extremely unsafe."

The Joy God twisted his thousand hands and feet, his voice cold. "What do you mean?"

Lady Fortune snorted. "Don't you know your people in University City have been targeted by the Patrol Team?"

The Joy God paused slightly. "Impossible. We've been extremely careful. There's no way we could have leaked any information."

Lady Fortune flashed a portion of Zhang Pianpian's investigation report before the Joy God. "This is an internal report from the Patrol Team. Have you read it carefully?"

The Joy God's thousand hands and feet trembled simultaneously. A hint of surprise flickered in his eyes as he looked at Lady Fortune. He thought to himself, "This fellow... he's even planted agents within the Patrol Team of Myriad Laws University?"

"How deeply has the Fortune God infiltrated Myriad Laws University's University City?"

A flurry of thoughts raced through Joy God's mind. Recalling the report he had just seen, he said solemnly, "They're targeting... Feng Yuhuan? But the investigation was supposed to be closed. Why now?"

Joy God was clearly deeply concerned about what had drawn the Patrol Team's attention, as it could jeopardize his future operations within Myriad Laws University City.

Lady Fortune cut straight to the point. "Investigate thoroughly. See if Feng Yuhuan is still harboring resentment, unwilling to be controlled, and deliberately stirring up trouble."

Joy God countered, "Impossible. He wouldn't cause trouble on his own."

"So certain?" Lady Fortune pressed. "Has he already become one of your followers?"

Joy God hesitated briefly, but remembering Lady Fortune's earlier disclosure of internal documents, he admitted frankly, "Yes, he's already a follower. He wouldn't act against us."

"Then investigate whether Feng Yuhuan has offended anyone," Lady Fortune suggested. "See if someone is trying to frame him."

She continued, "Joy God, I'm warning you. I've been cultivating my influence at Myriad Laws University for a long time. I won't tolerate you coming here and undermining my efforts, stirring up chaos everywhere, and ultimately dragging me down with you."

---

"Idiot!"

In the lower reaches of the Dark Spirit Realm, the Joy God's consciousness clashed repeatedly with Feng Yuhuan's, the Joy God snarling, "Do you even realize you're being watched?"

Feng Yuhuan's heart jolted. "I'm being watched?" he asked nervously.

"The Patrol Team is investigating you," the Joy God replied. "Do you have any idea why?"

Seeing Feng Yuhuan frown in deep thought, yet unable to come up with an answer, the Joy God scoffed coldly. "Figure out what's going on," he snapped. "Find out where you went wrong. Don't make me remind you again."

Naturally, Feng Yuhuan took this matter to heart. He immediately mobilized his connections to investigate, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't uncover the source of the problem.

For the next two days, Feng Yuhuan remained clueless, and the Joy God remained baffled by Feng Yuhuan's predicament.

After much deliberation, the Joy God finally turned to the Fortune God, a figure he considered unfathomable, whose influence within Myriad Laws University ran deep and wide.

Within the Dark Spirit Realm, Lady Fortune said coolly, "You want me to investigate for you? You know the rules, right?"

The Joy God chuckled softly. "Senior, I understand information trading. If you can uncover useful intelligence, we can provide you with whatever information you desire in return."

Lady Fortune said, "Give me a list of everyone Feng Yuhuan has recently been in contact with. Don't miss anyone — teachers, students, contractors, temporary workers, even Lower College and Junior College students."

The next day, Joy God returned to the Dark Spirit Realm and received Lady Fortune's reply.

"Zhang Yu?" Joy God asked, puzzled. "Is this student the reason for all this?"

Lady Fortune continued, "Zhang Yu has a roommate named Zhang Pianpian. Both of them came from Songyang City on the First Layer."

"Here's her file."

Joy God reviewed the file, a cold glint appearing in his Thousand Eyes. "So, because Feng Yuhuan offended this Zhang Yu during his work, Zhang Yu incited Zhang Pianpian to investigate him?"

Joy God never imagined that after all his elaborate efforts, the investigation would lead back to two students.

Could all this have been triggered simply because Feng Yuhuan had increased a student's workload several times over, offending him?

As he pondered how to deal with the two students, Fortune God interjected, "Hmph, can't you see? Zhang Pianpian isn't an ordinary student."

Joy God frowned slightly, scrutinizing the basic information again. Suddenly, a realization dawned on him. "Divine Dao?"

He further investigated through his information channels and discovered that a vast amount of Zhang Pianpian's data had been concealed.

Simultaneously, he learned that during the Ten Greats League Zhang Pianpian had participated in, a Talisman Department student from Heavenly Demon University had gone missing. This student was also a practitioner of the Divine Dao.

Observing Joy God's contemplative expression, Lady Fortune continued, "Do you understand now? Zhang Pianpian is no ordinary individual. She likely has a formidable background and should not be underestimated."

"Even if you manage to deal with her, it will likely come at a tremendous cost."

"In our line of work, the cardinal sin is clashing head-on with Righteous Gods."

"I don't care what methods you use, get Feng Yuhuan to resolve his conflict with Zhang Yuhua. Stop Zhang Pianpian from investigating any further."

"What the hell will happen if she uncovers more?"

Seeing Joy God about to leave, Lady Fortune quickly asked, "What about the deal?"

Joy God asked, "What do you want to know?"

Lady Fortune replied, "Why are you targeting the Soul Transformation Bionic?"

Instead of answering, Joy God directly sent a document to Lady Fortune.

Upon opening the file, Lady Fortune and Zhang Yu both gasped in shock.

"Divine Monarch Jade Nectar... secretly transferring cultivation to reincarnated individuals within the Sect?"

---

Lower levels of the Dark Spirit Realm.

The Joy God said coldly, "It's because of Zhang Yu that someone has set their sights on you."

"Resolve your conflict with him. Make sure he stops targeting you."

Feng Yuhuan paused, slightly taken aback. "You want me, a teacher, to resolve a conflict with a student?"

The Joy God scoffed. "Remember your true identity. You're not just a teacher at Myriad Laws University; you're also a follower of an Evil God."

"If Zhang Yu can attract the attention of a Righteous God, then don't antagonize him."

Feng Yuhuan gritted his teeth. "But if I proactively try to resolve the conflict, won't that make him suspicious?"

The Joy God: "Do I really need to teach you something so simple?"

The Joy God roared, "Resolve this matter within a day!"

---

That night, Feng Yuhuan seized the opportunity when Zhang Yu visited True Monarch Magnetic Pole's laboratory and hurried over himself.

After pacing outside the laboratory door for a long time, Feng Yuhuan finally steeled his resolve and entered.

Seeing True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Zhang Yu before him, Feng Yuhuan suppressed the resentment in his heart and forced a smile. "I know recent events have disrupted the laboratory's work," he said.

"But I had no choice. I would never willingly delay our projects unless absolutely necessary."

"Especially seeing True Monarch Magnetic Pole's repeated breakthroughs in researching the Soul Transformation Bionic, the entire Research Department has been greatly encouraged."

"I have always wholeheartedly supported True Monarch Magnetic Pole's advancement to Soul Transformation."

Feng Yuhuan paused, a wave of intense bitterness surging through his mind until he remembered the Evil God's warning.

He knew that to resolve this conflict, he couldn't just approach Zhang Yu; that would arouse suspicion too easily.

He had to pretend to reconcile with True Monarch Magnetic Pole, using the opportunity to smooth things over with Zhang Yu as well, even if it meant paying a higher price.

Suppressing the stifling pain in his heart, he presented 50 Spirit Coins to True Monarch Magnetic Pole and 20 Spirit Coins to Zhang Yu.

Then, with a sincere expression, Feng Yuhuan said, "A small token of my sincerity to express my apologies."

"And True Monarch Magnetic Pole, I will also do my best to reduce your disciple's workload on other projects."

The thought of having to work on other projects just to reduce Zhang Yu's workload filled Feng Yuhuan with renewed heartache.

Today's humiliating apology to True Monarch Magnetic Pole and a mere student like Zhang Yu left Feng Yuhuan feeling more stifled than ever before.

Watching Feng Yuhuan's retreating figure, True Monarch Magnetic Pole frowned. "What's gotten into him? Why the sudden change of heart?"

Zhang Yu replied, "Perhaps he's been monitoring your research progress, Master. Seeing your imminent breakthrough to Soul Transformation, he probably doesn't want to offend you too much."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded slightly, finding this explanation plausible.

In the following days, Zhang Yu finally had ample time to resume refining the prototype machine.

Within a week, he had completely finished the Level 1 prototype machine.

Watching the puppet open its eyes and slowly float into the air, a satisfied smile spread across Zhang Yu's face.

Just then, he posed a question to Lady Fortune in his mind:

"Lady Fortune, what exactly is the Divine Dao? Why are you and the Joy God so wary of it?"
