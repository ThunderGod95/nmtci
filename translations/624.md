# Chapter 624: Eternal Spring Sutra

As the contestants completed their trials one by one, the fourth stage of the competition came to a complete end.

With the times from the first four stages tallied, the overall scores for each team were ranked.

The expressions of the crowd ranged from worry to joy as they reviewed their teams' results.

Everyone understood that the time spent in the upcoming fifth stage would determine the final six teams to advance.

As the fifth stage officially began, a dark cloud suddenly formed in the sky. Like a drop of ink spreading in water, the cloud rapidly expanded, engulfing the entire arena in an instant.

Rain began to fall, quickly escalating into a torrential downpour.

The objective of this fifth stage was to alter the weather, transforming the raging storm back into a clear, sunny sky.

The time each contestant took to complete this task would determine their score for this stage.

Dao Qiankun stepped skyward, his hands clashing together black and white lightning bolts. The resulting pillar of light pierced the heavens, tearing through the firmament and sweeping across the world.

The blinding radiance illuminated the entire realm, as if a hundred thousand lightning strikes had erupted simultaneously in the sky.

As the incandescent light gradually subsided, the storm had vanished without a trace. The dark clouds that had blanketed the arena had disappeared completely.

Watching this scene, Zhang Yu took a deep breath, his nerves, previously buzzing with excitement from his victory, gradually calmed.

He glanced at the timer in his Bionic Eye, thinking to himself, "Not even twenty seconds?"

"Dao Qiankun's overall strength still surpasses mine."

"To catch up to him, to claim first place in the Ten Greats League, I must continue to push forward..."

One by one, the remaining contestants from the fifth stage took the stage, each employing their unique methods to manipulate the weather. Two performances particularly caught Zhang Yu's attention, and he committed their names to memory.

The first was Ying Mingchi, the top student from Celestial Monsters University, who possessed a dragon's head and a human body. He and Ying Zhoufan were currently the only two remaining contestants from Celestial Monsters University in the Ten Greats League.

Unlike Ying Zhoufan, who transformed into a dragon body, Ying Mingchi carried the true bloodline of a high-ranking dragon clan.

As he transformed into a white dragon, a single roar shook the dark clouds across the sky, causing them to roll back. Within half a minute, he had completely halted the raging storm.

However, because his interference with the weather extended far beyond the Examination Field's boundaries, the moment he finished... a barrage of weather violation notices materialized, projecting directly into his Spirit Realm Projection like layers of warning tape, completely enveloping him.

The other competitor was Xu Haixuan, the top student of Myriad Laws University's Talisman Department. He immediately set up a divine altar, invoked a talisman, and summoned the Spirit Realm interface for weather control. In just 25 seconds, he ended the storm.

With the fifth stage completed, the final rankings for the relay race appeared.

Zhang Yu gazed at the rankings projected in the sky and thought, "First place goes to Dao Qiankun and my team."

"Second place belongs to Ying Mingchi's dragon and Ying Zhoufan, along with Di Lianzhong's team from White Bone University."

"Third place is Cang Shenyu, Tian Shengong, Senior Sister Ye Xingli, and Xu Haixuan's team."

"Fourth place goes to Kuang Tianqing's team."

"Fifth place belongs to Wen Wuya and A-Zhen's team."

"Sixth place goes to Nine Heavens Liu's Finance Department team..."

With this, the list of thirty finalists was finalized.

All students from Pill Cauldron University had been eliminated.

Mu Qiansi, the top student from Joyful Union University, was also eliminated, much to everyone's surprise.

Seeing the thirty students in the rankings, Zhang Yu knew the ultimate champion would emerge from this group. Each of them would be his opponent, his target in the competition for the top spot in the Ten Greats League.

After the relay race concluded, True Monarch Tranquility addressed the students who had advanced to the finals in Myriad Laws University's lounge: "The final match will begin in one week."

"From the initial team battle to the relay race, and now the final competition... according to the university's predictions, it will be a purely individual battle."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly, sensing that the Ten Greats League events were gradually shifting from team-based to individual challenges.

True Monarch Tranquility continued, "The exact format of the final match remains undisclosed. We likely won't know until the day of the competition."

"Regardless of the competition's nature, it will undoubtedly test your individual capabilities, and the entire process will be lengthy."

"The next seven days are your opportunity to rest well and make a final push. Use any resources, strategies, or ideas you have. I won't waste your time with further remarks."

After True Monarch Tranquility departed, Ye Xingli turned to Zhang Yu and asked, "Junior Brother, what are your plans for the next week?"

Zhang Yu replied, "I'll continue cultivating and also fine-tune my magical artifacts and Bionic."

"The Seven Absolutes Bionic sustained considerable wear during the relay race and needs repairs," Zhang Yu said.

Just then, Dao Qiankun's voice rang out, "Want to grab a meal together? My treat."

Zhang Yu and Ye Xingli turned to see Dao Qiankun approaching with a smile, followed by Li Shiwei, the second-ranked student from the Dao Techniques Department, and Yan Qianji, the top-ranked student from the Artifact Refinement Department.

Noticing Li Shiwei's hostile glare, Zhang Yu wondered what he had done to offend her.

As for Dao Qiankun's offer, Zhang Yu readily accepted. The continuous battles, competitions, and cultivation, along with repeated severe injuries and self-healing, had taken a toll on his body. A high-quality meal would be the perfect replenishment.

After arriving at the reception hall of Dao Qiankun's Flying Boat and enjoying a hearty meal, Zhang Yu lay back contentedly, feeling his flesh, meridians, and Dantian nourished.

At that moment, Yan Qianji asked, "Brother Dao, Kuang Tianqing's team didn't perform well this time. Are the Four Heavenly Demon Schools no longer planning to protect her at all costs?"

Dao Qiankun replied calmly, "They're simply securing additional qualifying spots while ensuring Kuang Tianqing's advancement."

"The Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs of the Four Heavenly Demon Schools have reached a consensus: they're determined to push Kuang Tianqing to claim first place."

At this point, Zhang Yu couldn't help but feel curious. He asked, "Brother Dao, why can the Soul Transformation cultivators from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools act in unison and push Kuang Tianqing to the top? Why can't the Soul Transformation cultivators from Myriad Laws, Vajra, Immortal Soldiers, and Heavenly Sword unite to support you in winning the championship?"

Li Shiwei couldn't resist glaring at Zhang Yu again, inwardly cursing him as a "sycophant" for stealing the words she wanted to say.

Although everyone present were academic overachievers from Myriad Laws University, including Yan Qianji, a Soul Transformation disciple, they still knew little about the cultivators' true intentions.

Yet, for some reason, everyone — including Zhang Yu — had a feeling that Dao Qiankun knew more about the Soul Transformation cultivators' plans than anyone else.

Sensing the group's curious gazes, Dao Qiankun smiled faintly and said, "Because the Soul Transformation cultivators from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools... are older."

"Their average age is higher than that of the Soul Transformation cultivators from Myriad Laws, Vajra, Immortal Soldiers, and Heavenly Sword."

"Therefore, the Soul Transformation cultivators from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools find it easier to reach a consensus, to share a common goal: extending their lifespans."

"Unlike the Soul Transformation cultivators from Myriad Laws, who each aim for different Immortal Sect Techniques, the Four Heavenly Demon Schools have already decided which technique Kuang Tianqing will choose if she wins the championship."

"That technique is called the Eternal Spring Sutra and it grants an additional ten thousand years of lifespan."

Dao Qiankun sighed. "Once the Soul Transformation cultivators from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools obtain this technique and extend their lives, the next few centuries or even millennia will belong to them. Nascent Soul cultivators below the tenth layer of Kunxu will likely never have a chance to rise to prominence."

"For the next ten thousand years, the Four Heavenly Demon Schools will maintain absolute dominance."

"Wealth will continue to concentrate, and the assets of these Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs will completely permeate every corner of the universities."

Zhang Yu's heart tightened at this. He could almost see the dozen or so Soul Transformation cultivators outliving generation after generation of Heavenly Chosen, draining the lifeblood from successive generations.

But a question arose in his mind: "The Immortal Sect Techniques are awarded solely to the champion. How will the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs obtain them?"

Dao Qiankun replied calmly, "If military-grade cultivation techniques are like something many cultivators can access but lack the qualifications to practice and use..."

"Immortal Sect-level Techniques are completely inaccessible — even the related knowledge is beyond reach. Even if someone wanted to practice them without authorization, it would be impossible."

"For Soul Transformation cultivators, as long as Kuang Tianqing masters the Eternal Spring Sutra, they have countless ways to funnel resources into her, enabling her to develop her own longevity techniques with proprietary rights."

"After all, the Eternal Spring Sutra was specifically chosen for this purpose. Among the Immortal Sect's longevity techniques, it's not considered top-tier, making it relatively easier to master."

Yan Qianji frowned. "Will the Heavenly Court and the sects tolerate this? Allowing the Soul Transformation cultivators from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools to control the lower realms for tens of thousands of years?"

Dao Qiankun glanced at him. "How do you know this isn't the plan of someone in the upper realms?"

"Do you think everyone above is satisfied with the current state of Kunxu?"

"Of course not. They simply have different ideas and visions for Kunxu's future development, each wanting to steer its transformation along a different path."

"These conflicting visions lead to different choices, which in turn create contradictions and conflicts that ultimately spill over into the lower realms."

Back in his Flying Boat, Zhang Yu recalled Dao Qiankun's words, thinking to himself, "If I win the championship, which Immortal Sect Technique should I choose?"

"If the Soul Transformation stage wants to extract Immortal Dao Technology from me, can I resist?"

Zhang Yu shook his head, concluding that resistance would likely be futile, or perhaps there was no reason to resist at all?

"Does that mean the Immortal Sect Technique I choose will also alter Kunxu?"

Shaking his head again, Zhang Yu dismissed these thoughts as premature. Suppressing his distractions, he contacted the company to arrange the recruitment of monsterfolk.

"Find a batch of monsterfolk. Under the guise of medical examinations, draw their blood to see if it can supplement the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture."

"But this method will only yield blood from lower-tier monsterfolk. As for higher-tier ones..."

After a moment's thought, Zhang Yu sent a message to Ying Zhoufan: Are you there?

After waiting ten minutes without a reply, Zhang Yu sent another message: I want to buy blood from higher-tier monsterfolk.

Ying Zhoufan immediately replied: Just blood? What about essence? And meat, souls, and breeding materials? Buy them all together and I'll give you a discount. Contact me anytime for guidance on how to consume and cultivate them.
