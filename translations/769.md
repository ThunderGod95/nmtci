# Chapter 769: Single-Handedly Crushing the Entire Team

In the office area of the Edict Pavilion's Review Department, Chu Wangji was directing his outsourced employees as they conducted functional testing of a cultivation art.

His mind drifted back to Zhang Yu's audacious claim earlier that month, that he would boost the entire team's performance by 30%.

Chu Wangji's assessment of this declaration could be summed up in two words: sheer arrogance.

"You've only been in the Review Department for a few years? And now you think you can order all of us around?"

Chu Wangji's response to Zhang Yu's approach was simple: non-cooperation.

"To increase productivity, there are only so many methods," he mused.

"Upgrade our Bionics and magical artifacts, work overtime voluntarily, or hire more outsourced labor..."

In Chu Wangji's view, improving work efficiency and boosting monthly output ultimately boiled down to just this: throw money at it.

Or, if you wanted to add three more words: borrow more money.

If Chu Wangji were to invest heavily in his work, even taking out loans to work overtime, he could undoubtedly boost his performance significantly.

But why should he?

"Burn my Immortal Dao Potential to fulfill Zhang Yu's promises? To contribute to the achievements of our superiors?"

Chu Wangji refused to do such a thing.

In his view, Martial Dao Group Three had been operating perfectly well. As a seasoned veteran, he didn't need to compete for the top spot; he could consistently avoid overtime each month and still save some money, truly living a comfortable, leisurely life.

He could have steadily accumulated Immortal Dao Potential, patiently awaiting a promotion opportunity.

But now... Zhang Yu had thrown everything into chaos.

Just then, a message popped up before Chu Wangji's eyes:

Wen Zhiwei: "No matter how he tries to persuade or beg me, I absolutely won't cooperate."

Chu Wangji recognized this as a message from their small group chat. Several colleagues were discussing Zhang Yu's latest actions.

Wen Zhiwei, like Chu Wangji, was a Level 2 Sect Staff member. He knew she had a close relationship with the Group Leader.

Ever since learning that Zhang Yu intended to increase the group's performance by 30%, Wen Zhiwei had voiced strong dissatisfaction. Since arriving at work that day, she had been actively urging everyone not to cooperate.

Someone said, "I'll just work at the same efficiency as last month. Let the higher-ups see that Zhang Yu is full of hot air. How can performance metrics jump around like that?"

Another person added, "We can't let Zhang Yu succeed. Otherwise, we'll all suffer for it."

Wen Zhiwei declared, "It's settled! No one is allowed to work overtime this month!"

Just as the group members were discussing this in their chat, a message popped up in everyone's notification bar from Zhang Yu in the Martial Dao Group Three's work group:

"Reporting to the Group Leader, I've completed the review of the Rushing Cloud Divine Thunder Palm. The report was successfully submitted to the Dao Repository just now."

The group members scoffed inwardly, finding Zhang Yu's bragging insufferable.

Chu Wangji thought, "Showing off his performance in the group chat? How arrogant! Does he really think his high performance means we'll all have to listen to him?"

Wen Zhiwei immediately typed in the Small Group chat, "Let him compete himself and drown in debt. I want to see how long he can keep this up."

But soon after, Zhang Yu posted another message in the main group chat.

Zhang Yu: "Group Leader, I've completed the review of the Startled Swan Reflecting Shadow Blade. The report has just been successfully submitted to the Dao Repository."

Group Leader Qu Yizhi stared at Zhang Yu's message, his mind flashing back to Zhang Yu's remarks during the meeting.

He thought to himself, "This kid... loves to show off, trying to impress everyone and steal credit. Does he really think this is how you climb the ranks in the sect?"

"The sect isn't some place for scheming."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu remained undeterred, continuing to review various cultivation arts.

However, the first day's four-hour shift proved insufficient. He had only managed to complete two reports before it was time to clock out.

But Zhang Yu didn't stop after work. Returning to his dormitory, he continued to simulate various cultivation arts, all of which he had gathered from the Internal Dharma Realm during his shift.

After simulating each art, he transmitted all the data, images, and information from his mind to Ye Xingli via the Thought Membrane Seal.

The next morning, Ye Xingli immediately connected to the Internal Dharma Realm and began converting Zhang Yu's nearly twenty hours of accumulated work into written reports.

Shortly after everyone arrived at the office area, they saw Zhang Yu send his third report.

Then came the fourth, fifth, sixth...

Initially, the team members had viewed Zhang Yu's reports with a mix of resentment, amusement, and a "let's see how long he can keep this up" attitude.

But by the third day, when Zhang Yu's reports had surpassed ten, both the main and small group chats of Martial Dao Group Three fell into an eerie silence.

By the time the reports reached thirteen, the overwhelming pressure of Zhang Yu's skyrocketing performance had crushed the others into speechlessness, as if a massive mountain were pressing down on their chests.

Those thirteen reports completely shattered their own performance, grinding it underfoot.

"He... he's working too hard!"

"He's done a month's worth of my work in just three days! How high is his work efficiency?!"

"This is insane! It's too competitive!"

At that moment, Zhang Yu was no longer just an ordinary Sect Staff member in the eyes of his team.

Every movement he made, every glance he cast, seemed purpose-built for his work. Each statement he uttered, every message he sent, appeared to propel progress and boost project performance.

A monumental pressure of achievement radiated from him, as if he were determined to complete all the world's tasks single-handedly.

In that instant, the team members sharing Zhang Yu's office space felt utterly inadequate.

Despite being elite individuals who had endured rigorous trials to join the sect, they felt like utter failures in his presence, like loafers who spent their days slacking off, goofing around, and merely drifting through life.

"A workaholic!"

"That guy's a total workaholic!"

"If he keeps this up, he'll multiply his monthly performance by several times!"

Chu Wangji's mind raced with countless thoughts. He could already envision the higher-ups witnessing Zhang Yu's performance and launching massive promotional campaigns, even raising performance targets for all teams.

"If this keeps rising, the cost of coming to work will increase again."

Chu Wangji felt Zhang Yu's relentless stream of submitted review reports like a slowly rising tide. It had already climbed from his ankles to his waist and was still rising, threatening to completely engulf him.

"Is it really so hard to just get off work early?!"

Just as Chu Wangji was feeling suffocated by Zhang Yu's overwhelming performance pressure, he received a message from Zhang Yu: a complete review report on the copyright review of the Two Extremes Returning Wind Sword, the very cultivation art Chu Wangji was currently reviewing.

"He... he's done my entire job for me?!"

Chu Wangji's face paled as he read the report. He felt as if the heavens had cracked open, and thunder had struck his heart, leaving him shaken and disoriented.

"He's done my job? Then what am I supposed to do?"

The next day, when Chu Wangji received another review report from Zhang Yu, this time for a different cultivation art, his legs went weak, as if he could no longer stand in the office.

"If he can do all my work... then what use am I? Will I be 'optimized out' by the higher-ups?"

The Myriad Laws Sect's optimization cycles: unit optimization, department optimization, team optimization, Sect Staff optimization... As a Level 2 Sect Staff with years of experience, Chu Wangji knew this annual drama all too well.

The sect's upper echelons had insatiable demands for results, growth, and innovation.

Any decline in performance, profits, or anything deemed "useless" by the higher-ups risked being "optimized."

As for what happened after optimization? Except for a rare few who might find unexpected fortune in misfortune, most Sect Staff who had worked in their positions for years, lacking new skills, were often discarded like trash into dead-end roles, places akin to waste bins.

Pay cuts, demotions, transfers... Countless bleak scenarios flashed through Chu Wangji's mind.

At that moment, he felt Zhang Yu's overwhelming performance pressure bearing down on him with irresistible force, threatening to squeeze him right out of the office.

He screamed inwardly, "No! Don't take over my job!"

Just as Chu Wangji was consumed by panic and rage, he realized he wasn't the only one receiving similar messages.

Someone exclaimed in terror, "This is horrifying! He's already done all my work for tomorrow!"

Another voice trembled with lingering dread, "Zhang... Zhang Yu just asked me what tasks I have next. What does he mean by that?"

"Fuck...!" Wen Zhiwei exclaimed in shock. "Is he trying to... fucking crush the entire Martial Dao Group Three all by himself?!"

Chu Wangji was completely defeated. He knew he couldn't outcompete Zhang Yu and had no desire to be "optimized" out of his current job. Desperate, he approached Zhang Yu and begged him to stop interfering with his work.

"Just stop touching my work, and you can name your terms," Chu Wangji pleaded.

Zhang Yu smiled at the earnest look on Chu Wangji's face. "Then accept my guidance."

Chu Wangji frowned. "Guidance?"

Zhang Yu activated his Formless Martial Art, instantly simulating two martial arts techniques. One of them was precisely the technique Chu Wangji was currently reviewing.

As Chu Wangji watched his own reviewed technique being executed in Zhang Yu's hands and seamlessly integrated into a series of other martial arts, his mind went completely blank.

Chu Wangji knew that, thanks to the advancements from Martial One to Ten, those responsible for martial dao reviews could simulate any martial art in the world. But he had never imagined Zhang Yu could simulate a technique so quickly and then integrate it into various different martial arts with such ease.

Chu Wangji watched in awe at Zhang Yu's martial dao talent, accumulated knowledge, and cultivation prowess.

Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "You've never seen this martial art simulated like this before, have you?"

Chu Wangji opened his mouth to speak, but ultimately remained silent.

Watching Zhang Yu unleash and integrate the martial art with such unrestrained skill, Chu Wangji finally understood the vast gulf between them.

"This martial art will never shine as brightly in my hands as it does in Zhang Yu's..."

At the same moment, Zhang Yu produced the Thought Membrane Seal.

He said calmly, "Accept my guidance. You wouldn't want me to take over all your work, would you?"

Countless streams of data, insights, and enlightenment flooded Chu Wangji's mind, instantly granting him a complete understanding of the process and conclusion for the task at hand, as if he'd received the exam answers before the test.

Chu Wangji thought dazedly, "This feeling... I've never experienced anything like it during my work before."

He realized that by simply connecting to the Internal Dharma Realm, he could complete the review report in no time.

Chu Wangji gazed at Zhang Yu before him, realizing that as long as the latter was willing, he could continuously improve his own performance.

As his performance improved, he would become increasingly dependent on Zhang Yu.

Without Zhang Yu's support, maintaining his high performance would force him into endless overtime, draining his Immortal Dao Potential through repeated paid work sessions.

"This Zhang Yu..." Chu Wangji thought to himself, watching Zhang Yu's retreating figure. "He's practically my half-dad now."

Chu Wangji's rapid performance growth soon caught the attention of his colleagues.

Gradually, more and more team members approached Zhang Yu, seeking his guidance.

"Brother Yu, please don't touch my work."

"Senior Yu, I wish to receive your guidance."

"True Monarch Blazing Light, please teach me."

Through repeated martial art simulations, Zhang Yu transmitted his insights on various martial daos, testing, comprehension, experiences, and comparisons, directly to Chu Wangji and the others.

They then handled all the paperwork themselves, compiling Zhang Yu's insights into detailed reports.

As a result, the number of high-performing members in Martial Dao Group Three steadily increased, while those whose performance remained stagnant grew anxious, worried, and began considering seeking Zhang Yu's guidance.

"Impossible! How could I ever beg Zhang Yu for help?!"

When Group Leader Qu Yizhi of Martial Dao Group Three saw the message from Zhang Yu, realizing Zhang Yu had actually completed his assigned task, he inwardly raged, "Trying to threaten me? Dream on!"

As Group Leader, Qu Yizhi was also responsible for completing review tasks. Although his performance wasn't included in the team's performance rankings, his usual output would have easily placed him in the top three within the group.

Without such proficiency, he would struggle to command respect and effectively manage the team.

Yet, as Qu Yizhi gradually realized that his team members' performance was improving one by one, even surpassing his own, he began to feel a growing sense of urgency.

"If this keeps up, I'll end up near the bottom of the rankings!"

This realization struck Qu Yizhi with great alarm. He could almost see the overtime deadline bearing down on him.

And when he discovered that more and more team members were taking orders from Zhang Yu, warning bells began to ring loudly in his mind.

He knew he couldn't let the situation deteriorate any further.

Thus, Qu Yizhi sent Zhang Yu a message: "Come to my office."

But after a long wait, seeing that Zhang Yu still hadn't appeared at his desk, Qu Yizhi's expression darkened slightly.

He sent another message, urging Zhang Yu to hurry.

This time, he finally received a response.

Zhang Yu: "I'm busy with work. I'll come over when I'm finished."

Qu Yizhi frowned at this response. In his eyes, Zhang Yu, a cultivator who had climbed up from the First Layer, possessed both cunning and shrewdness, far from being a naive fool.

The reason for this reaction...

"This guy... he's holding a grudge against me?"

"He's figured out I'm blocking him?"

While guiding his team members in approving cultivation arts, Zhang Yu had discovered something peculiar.

During repeated Simulated Cultivation Art simulations and mental exchanges with his team members, he discovered that the cultivation arts each member was approving... seemed fundamentally incompatible with their martial dao styles.

If it had been one or two cases, he might have dismissed it as coincidence.

But when Zhang Yu found this pattern across almost everyone, he realized it couldn't be coincidence. Someone was deliberately manipulating things.

Within Martial Dao Group Three, only one person had the means and opportunity to orchestrate this: Group Leader Qu Yizhi.

"This guy... he's deliberately targeting me? Trying to sabotage me?"

Zhang Yu knew that appealing to reason or sentimentality would be futile when dealing with sect disciples.

So he had no intention of engaging in pointless negotiations with Qu Yizhi. He would force the man to come begging to him.

Seeing Qu Yizhi's message again, Zhang Yu simply replied, "Group Leader, rest assured. I'm accelerating the work."

Closing the communicator, Zhang Yu immediately buried himself back in his work.

Since the beginning of the month, he had completely abandoned his Nascent Soul Sacred Body cultivation, dedicating himself entirely to the work of Martial Dao Group Three.

During work hours, he simulated martial dao techniques; after work, he continued simulating martial dao techniques; and even when team members came seeking his help, he continued simulating martial dao techniques.

At that moment, Zhang Yu seemed to have transformed into a martial dao analysis instrument, constantly analyzing martial dao techniques and sending the results to each team member.

Through his solitary efforts, he single-handedly propelled the entire Martial Dao Group forward.

Watching his performance ranking steadily decline, Qu Yizhi grew increasingly agitated.

"If this continues, my performance this month will really end up in the bottom tier."

As this thought surfaced, Qu Yizhi recalled Minister Luo Wuji's instructions from the previous meeting.

He had publicly promised the Minister to fully support Zhang Yu's work.

If most team members' performance failed to improve, it would naturally prove Zhang Yu's incompetence and empty boasts.

But if everyone else's performance improved over the month, and only Qu Yizhi's remained stagnant, what would the Minister think of him?

"He'd probably think I'm deliberately sabotaging his efforts..."

Recalling Minister Luo Wuji's words, Qu Yizhi understood that the Minister wanted to achieve another breakthrough in performance before the March evaluation.

"If the Minister thinks I'm deliberately undermining his grand plan..."

The thought sent a chill down Qu Yizhi's spine.

"Should I work overtime? Or spend money to improve my work efficiency?"

The prospect of depleting his Immortal Dao Potential filled Qu Yizhi with a thousand pangs of reluctance.

After much deliberation, it seemed that accepting Zhang Yu's guidance, working together to boost Martial Dao Group Three's growth, and fulfilling his promise to the Minister... this previously impossible option had now become the best course of action.

"But what about the Deputy Minister?"

Just then, Qu Yizhi's eyes flickered as a message arrived.

It was Minister Luo Wuji reporting to the Pavilion Master at the Edict Pavilion meeting about the Review Department's current situation, including a brief mention of Martial Dao Group Three's improved performance.

Seeing this, Qu Yizhi's resolve gradually hardened.

He approached Zhang Yu's desk and said, "True Monarch Zhang, may I speak with you privately?"

The two moved to a cultivation chamber. Qu Yizhi began, "True Monarch Zhang, are you acquainted with Lu Hengzhang, Vice Minister Lu?"

Zhang Yu's heart stirred at the mention of his name. He recalled Lu Hengzhang's role as one of his interviewers.

Qu Yizhi continued, "Vice Minister Lu seems particularly interested in you. He's been urging me to give you extra training and push you harder, claiming it will temper you as a newcomer."

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened, his mind racing. "Is Lu Hengzhang trying to undermine me?"
