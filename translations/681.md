# Chapter 681: Immortal Sect Technique Enters the Pool

A resounding victory!

News of an unprecedented triumph swept through the Spirit Realm, appearing in the Bionic Eyes of every cultivator.

In the wake of this monumental victory, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole became an object of universal worship. Even her previous defeat was now reinterpreted with various justifications.

Feng Tingting posted on the Spirit Realm's social media: "The last battle wasn't actually a loss. It was likely a strategic move to destroy the Moon. This battle, aimed at reclaiming the Sun, makes it two consecutive victories!"

Yu Xinghan declared on his social media platform: "Finally, no more endless interference from the Evil Gods! Now we can work 24/7!"

"From now on, we'll return to the good old days of everyone having overtime and endless work!"

A flood of comments poured in below his post, filled with excitement and enthusiasm for unlimited overtime.

The most fervent group among them was the vast number of Soul Cultivators from other regions, particularly the populous monsterfolk Soul Cultivators, who expressed relief at finally having a viable path to survival.

Meanwhile, Tian Shengong from Immortal Armaments University commented: "If Greenwood hadn't dragged us down in the last battle, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole would have won outright! Civil Engineering is just useless — they should stick to construction sites and stay off the battlefield."

Moments later, Tian Shengong was shocked to discover he had been silenced.

"Myriad Laws' censorship has reached Immortal Armaments territory? Cross-school enforcement? Isn't that overstepping their authority?"

Bei Wufeng, using an alt account, flooded the Spirit Realm with messages: "Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole single-handedly reversed the tide, destroying the moon, seizing the sun, and shattering the heavens! Her unparalleled achievements have cemented her status as the true number one Soul Transformation expert of the Ten Universities! Glory to Myriad Laws!"

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter of the Security Department mobilized the Soul Cultivator Trolling Army, stirring up public sentiment for a grand expedition.

"Counterattack! Counterattack! Counterattack!"

"Go up and seize wealth! Seize medicine! Seize people!"

The idea of a counterattack against the upper layers, a frenzy of plunder, was clearly not unique to True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter.

Since the cataclysmic changes — the crimson moon's ascent and the breakthroughs to Soul Transformation — the Second Layer's economy had steadily deteriorated. Resource consumption consistently outstripped production.

Even the powerful cultivators who had once profited from suppressing rebel armies soon found their gains dwindling. The rebel forces had been drained dry, yielding no further spoils.

Nearly everyone on the Second Layer was growing increasingly impoverished.

Thus, when the barriers between the Second and Third Layers shattered, countless individuals began to stir with restless ambition.

Watching the news reports featuring images of the Magnetic Pole, Divine Monarch Greenwood smiled faintly, feeling a great weight lift from his heart.

He sighed in relief, murmuring, "It's finally done."

Though harsh criticism of him echoed throughout the Spirit Realm, Divine Monarch Greenwood paid it no heed.

As long as he could shield the Magnetic Pole and protect Zhang Yu from harm, he was willing to bear the slander and endure the insults.

However, when he saw Tian Shengong's comment, he couldn't help but frown.

"Insult me all you want, but don't insult Civil Engineering."

Divine Monarch Greenwood immediately sent a message to Tu Lishan: "Contact Immortal Soldiers and tell them to keep their students in line. No more reckless talk..."

After ending the call with Tu Lishan, Divine Monarch Greenwood messaged the Magnetic Pole: "When are you coming back?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole replied: "Still in a meeting with the Ten Universities Soul Transformation Experts, discussing our next steps."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole added: "Come over here and help me bring the World-Piercing Cone back."

Divine Monarch Greenwood knew this meant he was being asked to retrieve the World-Piercing Cone and Zhang Yu, who was inside it.

Zhang Pianpian scrolled through the Spirit Realm's vast information network, thinking to herself, "Good. With the Second and Third Layers now connected, the Soul Transformation and Nascent Soul experts from the Ten Universities can finally reclaim their belongings left on the Third Layer."

"I should also return to the Third Layer and retrieve my things."

As she read the various reports speculating about Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, Spatial Technology, and the World-Piercing Cone, Zhang Pianpian walked to the Soul-Guiding Pool, her gaze drifting over a cultivation art within.

"Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier... A Strategic-level Immortal Sect Daoist Art."

Spirit Realm data streamed across Zhang Pianpian's vision. After a brief calculation, she reached a conclusion.

"The appearance of this Immortal Sect Daoist Art in the Soul-Guiding Pool almost perfectly coincides with the time of Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's death."

"Which means..."

A thoughtful expression flickered across Zhang Pianpian's face. "Brother, were you there at the scene?"

Heavenly Sword University.

Bai Zhenzhen watched the news updates, her previously taut nerves finally relaxing. "Now I can finally breathe a sigh of relief, right? Those old fogeys won't be watching me anymore, will they?"

As she observed the growing buzz in the Spirit Realm about expeditions to the Third Layer, a fighting spirit gradually ignited within her.

"I'm going to the Third Layer too. My Divine Spiritual Root is perfectly suited to grow stronger through combat and plunder."

Kunxu Third Layer.

Inside a research institute, the ground trembled intermittently, and deep, resonant booms echoed from the depths below.

Wang Yin knew that a major battle was raging outside the institute.

In recent days, the Ten Great Universities had been steadily losing ground on the Third Layer. Wang Yin, along with the faculty and students of Netherworld University, had been retreating while fighting, constantly changing hiding places.

But now, as the thunderous sounds drew ever closer, Wang Yin felt that he might not be able to escape this time.

"Damn it!"

"If only my mother were here, how dare they bully and humiliate me?"

Yet moments later, Wang Yin, who had looked utterly dejected, suddenly shouted, "Yes!"

Upon seeing the news that the Second and Third Layers had been reconnected, he exclaimed excitedly, "Did they break through from below?"

Taking a deep breath, Wang Yin immediately sent a message to Netherworld University on the Second Layer: "Mom! You've finally achieved Soul Transformation!"

As the war situation shifted, news swept through Kunxu's Second and Third Layers like a raging storm.

Kunxu's Fifth Layer.

In a world shrouded by layers of black Heavenly Veils, a pair of eyes slowly opened, gazing at the Evil God before them.

"Herald God... why have you summoned me?"

The Evil God known as Herald God replied, "Some unexpected developments have occurred below. After careful consideration, I felt it was necessary to inform you..."

Herald God observed the man before him, knowing that Fu Xiantian was a disciple taken by the Immortal on Kunxu's Fifth Layer and the nominal leader of the Righteous Qi Alliance.

However, since imparting the Immortal Sect Technique, this nominal leader had remained in secluded cultivation.

Whether it was the Finance Department, the Demonic Sect, or the Evil Gods themselves, all believed that when Fu Xiantian emerged from seclusion, he would effortlessly resolve any crisis and secure ultimate victory, regardless of the circumstances.

Such absolute confidence — an unwavering faith — was placed in this disciple of the Immortal.

At that moment, upon hearing the news that the Second Layer Sun had fallen, the spatial barriers had been breached, and the Third Layer's defenses had been shattered, the man frowned slightly. "Magnetic Pole... she shouldn't be capable of this."

The Herald God replied, "Auspicious God believes she may have gleaned the secrets of Kunlun in the Palm from Zhang Yu."

"After all, Zhang Yu, being only at the Golden Core Realm, could hardly grasp the spatial mysteries of Kunlun in the Palm. But Magnetic Pole might be different..."

"Zhang Yu..." The man scoffed. "That fellow Master Ying favored? He betrayed his master's expectations, choosing the wrong path."

"I never wanted such filth to stain my master's sleeves."

"But since my master wishes him to live, I will respect his will and spare him..."

"Have Auspicious God continue monitoring him. If an opportunity arises, bring him to the Fifth Layer. I will re-educate him, free him from Kunxu's madness, and guide him back to the righteous path."

"As for the Magnetic Pole, I personally arranged the seals on the third and fourth layers of the heavens. No matter how she struggles, she cannot break through them."

"I couldn't care less about your battles on the second and third layers... Just remember, not a single iota of the monthly tribute can be missing."

"When I emerge from seclusion, all problems will naturally resolve themselves."

After giving these instructions, Fu Xiantian turned to the Herald God and asked, "By the way, is the Evil God Register complete yet?"

The Herald God replied, "Almost finished. Once it's done, we'll be able to contact all the Evil Gods across the layers."

Fu Xiantian said, "Remember, this matter is even more critical than the Magnetic Pole. Ensure every Evil God is accounted for — not a single one must be missed."

With that, Fu Xiantian closed his eyes again and retreated into the deepest level of seclusion.

Meanwhile, he thought to himself, "Master, rest assured, I won't keep you waiting long."

"When I emerge from seclusion, I will send all the living beings of these Kunxu layers — billions of souls — into Reincarnation."

Myriad Laws University.

Divine Monarch Greenwood watched Zhang Yu emerge from the drill, his gaze sharpening. "How are your injuries? Should I send someone to treat you?"

Compared to his original broken bones and severed tendons, Zhang Yu's body had healed significantly after several hours of active self-regeneration.

"Just have Xiao Qingxuan treat me with his Ancient Medical Techniques," Zhang Yu replied. "I don't want anyone else knowing."

With a smile, Zhang Yu turned to Divine Monarch Greenwood and asked, "Teacher, the situation has changed now, hasn't it?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood nodded solemnly. "After this battle, the Second Layer will no longer be plagued by the Blood Moon. The economy will gradually recover."

"The Ten Universities are already preparing a massive army to launch an expedition to the Third Layer, supporting the Third Layer's school districts in resisting the Rebel Army."

"Magnetic Pole has also proposed to the schools the implementation of a Joint Cultivation Program to rapidly enhance the strength of teachers and students across all institutions..."

At this point, Divine Monarch Greenwood looked at Zhang Yu with a sigh. "Yet none of this glory will be yours."

"Teacher, I understand," Zhang Yu replied. "I'm still too weak — too weak to deserve such glory."

Divine Monarch Greenwood continued, "Although the Magnetic Pole's current radiance is dazzling enough to capture most people's attention, it won't deter those who are determined to pry into your affairs."

"From now on, you must completely retreat into the shadows, staying out of sight as much as possible. Avoid all attention, distance yourself from crowds, conceal your sharpness, bide your time, and quietly enhance your cultivation, accumulating strength."

"During this period, we will sever all external connections and benefits, but Magnetic Pole and I will provide everything you need for your cultivation."

Zhang Yu nodded. "I understand, Teacher."

"I won't emerge from seclusion until I break through to the Nascent Soul stage."

"And not just the Nascent Soul," he thought to himself. "I won't emerge until I've leveled Kunlun in the Palm to 40."

Before long, someone at Myriad Laws University noticed Zhang Yu's disappearance.

He wasn't participating in expeditions, experiments, or company operations. He even missed the graduate student final exams.

No one knew where he had gone. Even all information related to Zhang Yu in the Spirit Realm had been blocked and suppressed.

Time flowed swiftly as Zhang Yu vanished.

One month... two months... three months...
