# Chapter 451: Vajra University, One of the Ten Greats

Golden River University's competition venue was a simulated mountainous terrain.

Observing the undulating hills and the lush vegetation, Zhang Yu remarked, "I don't know about Golden River University's other aspects, but its sheer size is impressive."

Mo Shangjin added, "If you calculate the total area of Myriad Laws University City by multiplying the area of each floor by the number of floors, it's actually larger than Golden River University."

"However, Golden River University has very few Spirit Veins, making land prices far lower than ours. With no height restrictions during construction, the overall space feels much more expansive."

"That's just how it is. The more expensive the land, the denser the buildings. The cheaper the land, the more sprawling the urban development tends to be."

As they spoke, Zhang Yu and his group arrived at the competition venue's entrance.

There were no spectators, no cheerleaders, and not even referees present, aside from their opponents.

After all, it was the day of Golden River University's recruitment event, and students had little spare time to physically attend the competition.

Even those who wished to watch the competition could attend remotely thanks to the Spirit Realm Network!

Zhang Yu glanced at his opponents, the Civil Engineering Competition Team from Golden River University, and noticed they were observing his team as well. However, the moment they realized Zhang Yu was looking at them, they hastily averted their gazes.

Visible tension, Zhang Yu thought to himself.

Just then, Mo Shangjin, standing beside him, said, "Everyone, prepare yourselves. We'll stick to the battle plan we discussed earlier..."

---

As both teams warmed up and prepared to enter the arena, a Spirit Realm Projection silently descended into the spectator stands above the competition venue.

A young man whose entire body seemed coated in gold paint crossed his arms and coldly surveyed the two teams below. His name was Chan Rong, an Academic Overachiever from Vajra University, one of the Ten Greats.

Chan Rong's Spirit Realm Projection was virtually indistinguishable from his physical appearance. On his flesh, unaugmented by Bionics, dotted lines traced the contours of various body parts, each marked with a price tag.

Many students at Vajra University enjoyed this practice: after determining the value of each part of their physical bodies, they would mark high prices on themselves, flaunting their strength and wealth while simultaneously advertising themselves.

Once a body part was sold at a high price, they could consider replacing it with a more powerful Bionic.

Moments later, another Spirit Realm Projection materialized beside the golden figure, smiling. "Chan Rong, you actually came to watch Myriad Laws University's match! After all, Vajra University's next opponent is Myriad Laws, right?"

After speaking, the newcomer scanned Chan Rong's projection, noting the marked prices on his body parts. "Wow, your physical body's value has increased significantly! Looks like you've made tremendous progress this past year!"

Chan Rong turned to face the cylindrical figure before him, his gaze sharpening. "Wan Gouxuan?"

Chan Rong knew that Wan Gouxuan was the top student in Immortal Armaments University's Civil Engineering Department. Last year, Immortal Armaments University's Civil Engineering Competition Team had placed third in the inter-university competition, trailing only Celestial Monsters University and Myriad Laws University.

Chan Rong stared at Wan Gouxuan and asked, "Don't you want to know how much your body is worth?"

Wan Gouxuan: "Huh?"

Chan Rong: "If you want to find out how much your body can fetch, check out the Shedding Flesh Pavilion, our second-hand body platform! Thanks to selling my right hand there, I earned an extra thirty Spirit Coins..."

Wan Gouxuan: "No, I didn't ask!"

Chan Rong: "You can recycle any old Bionics or bodies you don't use anymore at the Shedding Flesh Pavilion. They offer on-the-spot appraisals, verification, and payment..."

Wan Gouxuan: "Are you done?"

Chan Rong: "The school assigned us a new daily task this semester: promoting the platform to one person outside campus each day. Thanks for your understanding!"

Wan Gouxuan: "Vajra University really loves making students do their advertising!"

Chan Rong asked, "Did you come to watch the Myriad Laws competition?"

The cylindrical form Wan Gouxuan had taken replied, "I lost to Mo Shangjin last year. How could I miss their first match this year? Especially after hearing about his injury, which you must have heard about too, right?"

Chan Rong, his body gleaming like gilded bronze, turned to observe Zhang Yu and the others below. "It's a pity Mo Shangjin isn't here," he remarked. "Perhaps his injuries haven't fully healed, or maybe he simply couldn't be bothered with this match. Still, apart from Li Zhen, the other five are new faces I've never seen before!"

"It seems the Jade Nectar Coin incident and Mo Shangjin's absence have severely weakened Myriad Laws University's team," Chan Rong analyzed.

Wan Gouxuan nodded in agreement. "I was hoping to gauge Mo Shangjin's condition, but it seems that's impossible now."

"Let's hope he recovers quickly," Chan Rong replied.

"I've been training relentlessly this past year precisely to defeat him personally!" Wan Gouxuan declared.

"If he can't represent Myriad Laws in the competition, the prestige of this year's rankings will be diminished!"

As they spoke, the competition below had officially begun.

Shi Huaiyu and Su Yanyang joined forces, unleashing a massive wave of mud and sand that surged toward Golden River University's team like a tsunami.

With a thunderous roar, the deluge completely engulfed their construction site.

---

Wan Gouxuan commented, "The Myriad Laws University team's Civil Engineering Seven Absolutes are exceptionally solid. They're not just using the Minor Threefold Combination; they're integrating other Seven Absolutes cultivation arts into their attacks, constantly shifting their offensive patterns!"

"Their Bionics are also top-tier brands and models!"

"Overall, their strength is decent, but they're still far behind Mo Shangjin!"

Chan Rong of Vajra University meticulously observed the match, recording his observations while responding, "Golden River University retreated immediately at the start. It seems they knew they couldn't win a direct confrontation and planned to use guerrilla tactics!"

"They're probably trying to secretly complete their construction elsewhere and bring it back before the competition ends!"

"The Myriad Laws University team is wandering around like headless chickens. It appears their current team lacks anyone skilled in perception techniques!"

Just then, Golden River University's team suddenly burst from underground, ambushing Shi Huaiyu and Su Yanyang!

As the two sides clashed briefly before disengaging, with Golden River University's team retreating swiftly after taking damage, Chan Rong remarked, "Their speed is impressive!"

Wan Gouxuan observed, "The students from Golden River University prioritize speed. After all, with sufficient speed, they can work more efficiently, evade attacks and pursuits, and minimize expenses. It's the perfect strategy for the poor!"

Over the next period, Golden River University repeatedly launched surprise attacks from underground, withdrawing immediately after each brief clash.

Though their strikes were invariably countered by Myriad Laws University's defenses, leaving them injured, their wounds often healed significantly by the time they launched their next ambush.

Wan Gouxuan remarked, "Golden River University's team must have someone skilled in Yin-Yang Emergency Treatment."

"As a university renowned for its Civil Engineering and Dual Cultivation programs, they're likely using Yin-Yang Emergency Treatment techniques during the competition to temporarily heal their injuries."

"Construction, combat, and emergency treatment — that's their tactical approach!"

Watching Xiao Yunji casually repel an incoming Upper College Student, Wan Gouxuan commented, "Xiao Yunji's strength is considerable, but the coordination between her Bionics is flawed. Her synchronization rate is likely low, making her weaknesses glaring and easily exploitable."

His gaze then shifted to Xiao Qingxuan. "A full set of Extreme Tiger Brand Bionics! How did someone like him make it onto the Competition Team? Hmm? Over ten thousand Spirit Coins in debt?"

Wan Gouxuan frowned, temporarily marking Xiao Qingxuan as someone to watch. He couldn't quite figure out the man's background.

Next, he turned his attention to Zhang Yu, who was working on the construction site.

"Zhang Yu seems to be their team's dedicated builder for this competition."

"His construction efficiency is impressive, but he's relying entirely on physical strength? Doesn't he even have a Bionic? That severely limits his adaptability in high-intensity competitions."

"He's probably a reserve member. If Mo Shangjin enters the match, they'll likely swap him out."

After analyzing each member of the opposing team, Wan Gouxuan of Immortal Armaments University finally focused on Li Zhen. "As expected, compared to these rookies, the most formidable member of Myriad Laws University's team is still this veteran."

Li Zhen opened his mouth and unleashed a torrent of Earthly Fiend Qi.

Tracking the opponents tainted by the Earthly Fiend Qi, Li Zhen quickly located the Golden River University team members hiding to perform Dual Cultivation for emergency treatment.

---

As Li Zhen continued to spew streams of fluorescent green Earthly Fiend Qi, warnings flashed incessantly in the Bionic Eyes of the Golden River University members.

"The pollution level of this Earthly Fiend Qi is dangerously high!"

"I can't keep fighting like this! I'll get cancer!"

"The university's prize money is barely enough. If I get cancer, it'll all be wasted!"

"Give up!"

As the Earthly Fiend Qi swept across the arena, the Golden River University team quickly surrendered.

---

Watching this unfold, Wan Gouxuan remarked, "It seems that apart from Mo Shangjin, Li Zhen is the most formidable opponent. After him, there's Xiao Qingxuan, that mysterious newcomer whose true strength remains unknown."

Turning to Chan Rong beside him, he asked, "What do you think, Chan Rong? You're up against Myriad Laws next. Confident?"

Chan Rong replied calmly, "Myriad Laws has some strong new faces, and Li Zhen, their veteran, has mastered the power to control Earthly Fiend Qi."

"If I'd faced them a year ago, I wouldn't have been absolutely certain of victory."

"But now... if Mo Shangjin doesn't participate, Myriad Laws might as well concede defeat."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu, seeing the match's conclusion, glanced boredly at his construction project, thinking, "The gap between the Ten Greats and Upper College students is still too vast. Even if I hadn't participated, we would have won easily."

As they left the arena, Shi Huaiyu asked Mo Shangjin, "Why keep Zhang Yu focused on construction? With such a skill disparity, wouldn't the match have ended faster if he'd joined the fight?"
