# Chapter 431: Expert Commentary

On the examination grounds, Zhang Yu erupted in a cloud of blood mist.

At the final moment of the test, he unleashed two consecutive rounds of ultimate techniques, unleashing immense power that pushed his body to unprecedented extremes.

As the earth ceased its tremors and the battlefield fell silent, the Formless Spirit General beneath Zhang Yu's feet began to crumble.

The lifelike clay figure, once resembling flesh and blood, lost Zhang Yu's power and disintegrated into billowing dust.

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu, who had been standing atop the Formless Spirit General's head, plummeted downward.

In executing his ultimate techniques, Zhang Yu had poured every ounce of his Magic Power, Gang Qi, and physical strength into those final strikes.

Even the thoughts racing through his mind, amplified by multiple mental processes and the Time-Worn Demonic Eye, had been pushed to their absolute limit.

As a result, his brain, muscles, internal organs — every inch of his body — paid a heavy price for this extreme exertion.

Just as the blade of a sword inevitably wears down, chips, or even breaks when pushed beyond its limits in battle, Zhang Yu's body now felt as if it had endured brutal torture. Vast swathes of his muscles were torn, bones fractured, meridians ruptured, and his internal organs hemorrhaged profusely.

As the Formless Spirit General collapsed, Zhang Yu swayed slightly and began plummeting toward the ground. He tried to twist his torso to regain control of his descent, but discovered he didn't have even a shred of strength left in his entire body.

In that instant, Zhang Yu realized a crucial implication of his Martial Dao Micro-Control. He chuckled bitterly to himself, thinking, "If I use my control to completely drain my body, I can truly drain it completely — leaving me without even the strength to twitch!"

While these thoughts raced through his mind, Zhang Yu heard a soft whoosh nearby. A figure had pierced through the smoke and dust, appearing before him.

Director Gao gently caught the falling Zhang Yu. Observing the young man's bloodied and mangled state, he sighed inwardly, "Poor child, you need to rest now."

Sensing Zhang Yu's astonished gaze, Director Gao said calmly, "Rest assured, the exam time is up. It's over, so my arrival here is no problem."

He then called out to the side, "Is there a Righteous God present? Please escort this examinee for treatment."

Hearing Director Gao's words, Zhang Yu struggled to speak, "T-teacher, no need for treatment..."

Director Gao cut him off, saying calmly, "Don't worry about the medical expenses. I'll cover them."

Deng Bingding appeared beside them, smiling. "Director Gao, I'll take him for treatment."

As Deng Bingding looked at Director Gao, she thought to herself, Zhang Yu's designated mentor is True Monarch Magnetic Pole, right? This Director Gao...

Director Gao frowned. "Is there anything else?"

Deng Bingding smiled faintly. "Nothing at all!"

After watching Deng Bingding escort Zhang Yu away, Director Gao turned toward the Flying Boat. In the next instant, his figure flickered, and he vanished from the examination grounds.

Meanwhile, as the examinees evacuated the testing grounds, Righteous Gods gradually materialized above the arena, commencing battlefield cleanup, casualty assessment, and data collection.

On the Flying Boat, the judges and esteemed guests replayed key moments from the examination. Ping Han and Zhang Yu's performances dominated their Bionic Eyes.

True Monarch Cloud Haven calmly asked, "What are your thoughts on these two?"

Fifth-Rank God Gengchenyi replied, "Ping Han's Dao Heart has been tempered like steel through years of relentless training. Today, his accumulated strength erupted, demonstrating a dominance that swept across the entire arena."

"Especially his final Mountain-Lifting Strike — I doubt anyone present could have withstood it!"

Experts from other universities nodded in agreement, clearly endorsing Gengchenyi's assessment. They believed Ping Han deserved the Military Certificate.

However, True Monarch Celestial Elephant, a professor from Celestial Monsters University, curled his trunk, rattled his tusks, and declared, "Truly unstoppable? I believe Zhang Yu could have blocked it!"

He chuckled casually. "Zhang Yu's Martial Dao aptitude far surpasses that of all other examinees."

"Even the most ordinary martial arts techniques become extraordinary in his hands!"

Take the Dragon-Elephant Mountain-Crushing Palm, for example. Originally a common outer sect technique, when combined with his Minor Threefold Combination, it unleashed earth-shattering power!

"And then there's the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force, a military-grade martial art where every ounce of strength yields twelve times its potential. With just this technique alone, I doubt any student here could break through his defenses!"

The expert professors nodded in agreement, finding True Monarch Celestial Elephant's words compelling.

Director Lin watched the two judges, who had been cordial moments before, now locked in a heated verbal exchange. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly at the significance of the Military Certificate. The influence and benefits it carried were enough to ignite fierce competition among all parties vying for its ownership.

True Monarch Celestial Elephant clearly doesn't want Ping Han to obtain the Military Certificate and threaten Celestial Monsters University in the upcoming Civil Engineering Inter-University Competition, Director Lin mused. After all, Ping Han has already mastered the Seven Absolutes. Once he gets certified, he'll quickly gain control over the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power!

"Mastering military-grade martial arts is the difference between heaven and earth!"

"If Ping Han and Mo Shangjin were to team up, they could pose a significant threat to Celestial Monsters University in the competition!"

"As for Geng Chenyi, this Righteous God has overseen Myriad Laws University for years. Does his current support for Ping Han stem from a desire for the Civil Engineering Department to secure first place in the competition, boosting his own track record? Or does he have other motives?"

Director Lin's thoughts turned to True Monarch Cloud Haven. What are True Monarch Cloud Haven's intentions? Does he also support Ping Han and want him to collaborate with Mo Shangjin to secure first place for the Civil Engineering Department in the competition?

As Director Lin's mind raced, True Monarch Celestial Elephant continued, "Now, observe Zhang Yu's final burst of power!"

With a flick of his finger, the light screen before them zoomed in, replaying Zhang Yu's climactic sweep through the ranks of Yellow Turban Warriors.

"Look at this technique... and this one..."

True Monarch Celestial Elephant replayed scenes of Zhang Yu's palm strikes bombarding the Yellow Turban Warriors, meticulously detailing how the warriors' forms contorted under the force.

"To absorb the power of the defensive fortifications, amplify his own physical strength, and then add the force of Gang Qi — all while seamlessly integrating these energies into his Martial Dao techniques — culminating in a giant's explosive burst propelled by the Minor Threefold Combination!" True Monarch Celestial Elephant marveled.

"This sequence of power manipulations, each layer amplifying his destructive force, is nothing short of perfection!"

"And to achieve this while precisely targeting the Yellow Turban Warriors' vital points with every strike, maximizing damage with minimal force — that's an entirely different level of difficulty!"

"Now, imagine repeating this hundreds of times in mere moments. For candidates of this level, it's a feat akin to scaling the heavens!"

Many of the distinguished guests hadn't analyzed Zhang Yu's final assault in such detail. Hearing True Monarch Celestial Elephant's meticulous breakdown, they immediately grasped the extraordinary brilliance of Zhang Yu's concluding offensive.

Deng Bingding led Zhang Yu to receive treatment while listening to the judges' commentary. Hearing their remarks, she couldn't help but glance at the half-conscious Zhang Yu beside her, thinking, "His performance is even more astonishing than I initially predicted!"

Director Lin listened to True Monarch Celestial Elephant's analysis, inwardly musing, "Does this monster beast... really want Zhang Yu to secure the Military Certificate so badly?"

"Well, by the time Zhang Yu masters the Seven Absolutes and perfects the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, Mo Shangjin will have long graduated. This way, Celestial Monsters University will never face any threat from him in the competition!"

Meanwhile, Director Gao had returned to the Flying Boat. Listening to True Monarch Celestial Elephant's analysis, he nodded inwardly. "That Zhang Yu kid really gave me a scare this time!"

"Whether he secures the Military Certificate or not, we should formally accept him as a disciple now!"

Just then, another guest remarked, "Zhang Yu is impressive, but Ping Han could achieve the same result with sheer overwhelming power, without having to push himself to the limit!"

"After this exam, Ping Han's strength will skyrocket. His potential, his ceiling, and the Dao Heart he ultimately staked everything on are far beyond Zhang Yu's capabilities!"

Another guest countered, "Did Zhang Yu's desperate final gamble reduce his medical bills? Didn't he also risk everything? I see his Dao Heart as equally steadfast! If he had Ping Han's resources, his strength would undoubtedly surpass Ping Han's!"

The first guest waved his hand dismissively. "That's flawed logic. Wealth and cryptocurrency investments are themselves components of strength. There's no room for 'what ifs' here."

Director Gao stood aside, not uttering a word. He listened to the experts and professors from various universities debate fiercely, watching them argue over which of his two disciples — Ping Han or Zhang Yu — was more outstanding and deserving of the Military Certificate. A faint smile crept onto his lips.

It's a pity I can't record this. I'd love to send it to Magnetic Pole and show her how these experts and professors are tearing each other apart over which of my disciples is superior!
