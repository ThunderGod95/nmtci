# Chapter 434: Mentor Selection and Future Paths

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "I heard your students performed exceptionally well in the Military Certificate Examination this time."

Director Gao: "Even you've heard about it? Yes, they did quite well."

Director Gao: "It's a pity there's only one certificate available."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Then you'd better hurry and officially accept Zhang Yu as your disciple."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "With so many eyes on him during the exam, if he continues to excel, everyone will be vying for him."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Especially watch out for the other two directors in your department. They might have already made offers."

Reading True Monarch Magnetic Pole's warning, Director Gao felt a warmth of concern. Though she often seems unreliable, after centuries of friendship, she still has my back when it matters. As for her advice, Director Gao had already considered it.

For an ordinary student, becoming his mentee would be a dream come true, requiring only a word from him. As a mentor, he could guide their curriculum, arrange internships, and advise on postgraduate studies.

In short, as long as a student remains ambitious, their mentor wields immense influence over them.

Beyond the inherent authority of the mentor-student relationship, many mentors and students also sign additional contracts. This often occurs when a student is exceptionally talented. The mentor invests in the student while securing future returns.

Director Gao replied, "I understand. I'm already drafting the contract."

Seeing Director Gao's response, True Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled faintly and turned to Zhang Yu in her arms, awaiting his answer. Her primary purpose in meeting Zhang Yu today was to clarify what had happened during the Military Certificate Examination. Her secondary goal was to ascertain Zhang Yu's aspirations.

Hearing True Monarch Magnetic Pole's question, Zhang Yu paused briefly before answering, "Teacher Gao is a good person. Yes, Old Gao is indeed kind to his own people."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "But Old Gao is too weak. He can't protect you." Sensing Zhang Yu's puzzled gaze, she continued, "A genius like you needs complete freedom to fully develop your talents."

The less you are constrained, the greater your potential for growth!

Conversely, the more you are bound, the more your potential is wasted, even breeding resentment that undermines your pursuit of the Immortal Dao!

"It's like a top salesperson in a company. The more autonomy and higher commissions they receive, the more motivated they are to maximize profits. Restricting them leads to mutual loss!"

"But Old Gao... how much freedom can he truly give you?" True Monarch Magnetic Pole asked calmly.

"It's not a matter of his willingness, Zhang Yu," she continued. "It's an objective reality beyond either of your control. The less he restrains you, the harder it becomes to prevent others from poaching you. Don't tell me you wouldn't leave for a better offer. The ultimate path for Civil Engineering graduates is to escape the construction site! Conversely, the more Old Gao restricts you, the more he stifles your talents, ultimately hindering your immortal path and breeding resentment!"

Finding balance between you two will be difficult.

"Simply because Old Gao is in the Civil Engineering Department. Beautiful flowers can't bloom in the barren soil of a construction site! The Civil Engineering Department is destined to be unable to retain a student like you long-term!"

On the street, Zhang Yu listened quietly to True Monarch Magnetic Pole's words, cradled in her arms. He had to admit, she made a compelling argument.

Zhang Yu: "True Monarch, are you suggesting I publicly acknowledge our relationship and transfer to your department sooner?"

---

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "This contract will be tricky to draft."

Director Gao: "Ah, it's a delicate balance."

Director Gao: "The other departments are undoubtedly making their own offers to Zhang Yu."

Director Gao: "I can't afford to offer him too little. Even if he signs now, resentment will fester, crippling his future productivity and cultivation progress."

Director Gao: "Beyond that, I fear other departments might poach him."

In Director Gao's view, Zhang Yu's advancement to the Golden Core stage was all but guaranteed, and his chances of reaching Nascent Soul were promising. His goal was to nurture Zhang Yu's potential, expand the pie, and reap greater rewards — not to squander his talent by exploiting him at the Foundation Establishment or Golden Core stage. After all, a Nascent Soul cultivator's value far surpassed that of a Golden Core cultivator.

The challenge lay in crafting a contract that safeguarded his interests without stifling Zhang Yu's growth.

Director Gao had pondered this matter for a long time.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "I've taken care of the Artifact Refinement Department. I guarantee no one will try to poach him from there."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "But the Finance Department is another story."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Those bloodsucking vampires are ruthless and love throwing money around. I'm worried your student won't be able to resist!"

Reading True Monarch Magnetic Pole's message, Director Gao sighed inwardly. The thought of Zhang Yu potentially becoming a disciple of Director Lin or even the Finance Department made his expression darken.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "I do have an idea!"

Director Gao: "What is it?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Never mind, forget I said anything!"

Director Gao: Stop with the games. We've been friends for centuries. What can't you tell me?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "How about I protect you and your disciple?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "We could start a company together, sign Zhang Yu, and I'll shield you. No one would dare try to poach him then!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Actually, never mind!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "The Civil and Mechanical Engineering Department would accuse you of handing over talent to me!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "It would look like I'm trying to steal your disciple!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole watched as Director Gao remained unresponsive, unperturbed. She turned to Zhang Yu in her arms and said, "There's no rush to transfer departments. Since you've already passed the Military Civil Engineering Certificate Examination, stay in the Civil Engineering Department for now. Focus on mastering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power first."

"With this military-grade cultivation technique as your foundation, your physical body will become the ultimate natural treasure. When you later refine your Refined Dharma Corpse, you'll be leaps and bounds ahead of others!"

"This technique also combines well with artifact crafting. If you can integrate your skills in both civil engineering and artifact crafting in the future, it will be a tremendous advantage!"

Zhang Yu asked, "What about the Artifact Refinement Department's military-grade cultivation arts, the Heaven and Earth Tribulation Ring Formless Heart Weapon and the Grand Void Divine Artifact Strategy? Didn't you previously urge me to transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department sooner to have a chance to learn those?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "The Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You can always study the Artifact Refinement Department's military-grade martial arts when you pursue your Master's degree there."

"It won't take much longer. While you're mastering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power over the next two years, you can also complete your Civil Engineering credits early and graduate ahead of schedule. Then, you can apply for the Artifact Refinement Department's Master's program. You'll only be joining the Artifact Refinement Department two years later, but you'll gain a military-grade martial art in exchange. It's well worth it!"

After a moment of contemplation, Zhang Yu asked, "So... do you think I'll still have a chance to join a Sect in the future? Hmm?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole glanced at Zhang Yu in surprise. "You want to join a Sect?"

Zhang Yu met her gaze directly and replied frankly, "If I'm aiming for the pinnacle of the Immortal Dao, how could I not join a Sect? It's a commendable ambition!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed. "I won't sugarcoat it, lest you resent me later. In this era, Sects are becoming increasingly difficult to enter. At the very least, you'd need a doctoral degree and Nascent Soul cultivation. Even for undergraduate achievements, you'd need to win awards in the Inter-University League, preferably in the Ten Great Leagues!

"But none of this applies to you right now. To those high-minded Sect members, an undergraduate degree in Earth and Wood engineering is no different from a vocational diploma — they'd glance at it and toss it aside!

"If you truly want to join a Sect," she continued, "you'd need to switch departments by your third year. But honestly, by the time you graduate with your doctorate, Sect requirements will likely have risen even higher. This path..." True Monarch Magnetic Pole paused, choosing her words carefully. "It's simply not meant for..."

"The path you're considering is meant for those great figures who reincarnate! Don't ask for specifics. My advice is, if you have the opportunity, stay in Earth and Wood. First, learn the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to broaden your horizons. If you reach the Nascent Soul stage in the future, you won't regret this choice!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole didn't fully elaborate, but her meaning was clear: she didn't favor Zhang Yu switching to artifact crafting in his third year or attempting the Sect entrance exam.

Zhang Yu asked, "What if I master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power during my third year and then transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole's eyes flickered. "Impossible. Even if you could master it, obtaining the Seven Wonders of Civil Engineering..." She paused, then mused, "Well, not entirely impossible!"

She explained, "The University War is intensifying. More and more schools are preparing, and Inter-University competitions are gaining prominence as students' skills improve. The rules even change annually these days!

Naturally, the Civil Engineering Department's Inter-University competitions are now more highly valued than ever.

This time, Old Gao might even arrange for you to join Mo Shangjin's team to compete in the Inter-University League!

Under normal circumstances, obtaining the Seven Wonders of Civil Engineering — even by passing the seven required courses — would still be subject to various restrictions based on seniority, years of study, and overall grades!"

The Inter-University League presented a rare opportunity to persuade the Civil Engineering Department professors to relax their requirements, potentially granting Zhang Yu a chance to learn all Seven Wonders of Civil Engineering.

Hearing True Monarch Magnetic Pole's words, Zhang Yu's mind echoed with a familiar phrase: "Chaos is a ladder — this is truly my chance!"

Seeing Zhang Yu's eager expression, True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "Then give it a try."

"But if it doesn't work out, settle down in the Civil Engineering Department and wait until you master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power."

Zhang Yu nodded firmly. "What about Director Gao?"

Just then, a message popped up in Zhang Yu's bionic eye — it was from Director Gao!

Director Gao: Zhang Yu, what do you think of True Monarch Magnetic Pole?

At that moment, True Monarch Magnetic Pole had already suppressed the surrounding Spirit Realm with her Great Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda. The flowing messages of the Spirit Realm appeared as clear as fine hairs in Zhang Yu's vision.

Zhang Yu felt True Monarch Magnetic Pole's tight embrace, restricting all movement.

With a swift grab, True Monarch Magnetic Pole snatched the message from Director Gao floating in Zhang Yu's bionic eye. Smiling sweetly, she said, "Don't move. Let me reply for you."

Zhang Yu: Who is True Monarch Magnetic Pole??
