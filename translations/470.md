# Chapter 470: Widespread Attention

Moments later, 30 Spirit Coins were credited to Yu Xinghan's account.

He then distributed 3 Spirit Coins to Zhang Yu, his partner in the experiment, and 1 Spirit Coin each to Gongshu Jin and Ying Xin.

"A profit."

Yu Xinghan gazed at the 25 Spirit Coins added to his account, thinking that the trip hadn't been in vain. Even with his injuries, he had made a substantial gain.

Yu Xinghan's experience also thwarted True Monarch Celestial Seal's original plan.

"Yu Xinghan failed."

"So far, only Zhang Yu has successfully completed a standard Dual Cultivation session."

"What's the difference between them?"

"Too many variables to discern."

"The best approach is to have Zhang Yu continue participating in the tests to gather more data."

True Monarch Celestial Seal mused inwardly, "But if we want him to keep cooperating... the price will be too high."

30 Spirit Coins were a trivial sum for True Monarch Celestial Seal; he could easily afford it.

However, as the number of tests increased, the cumulative expenses would inevitably become substantial.

Although the funds weren't his personal wealth, True Monarch Celestial Seal took this project seriously and didn't want to squander the budget.

But if they wanted to pressure Zhang Yu into participating in the experiment...

"After all, he's an elite student from the Civil Engineering Department who obtained his Military Certificate in his third year. If we directly ask the department for him, they'll likely demand a high price."

"Just me alone..."

Realizing he might not be able to handle it alone, True Monarch Celestial Seal contacted True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

True Monarch Celestial Seal: "Magnetic Pole, I heard you have good connections with the Civil Engineering Department."

True Monarch Celestial Seal: "Is there any way to lower the price and get Zhang Yu to join our experiment?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "No need to rush."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "The situation isn't clear yet. Let's finish the next few batches of tests first."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Then we'll analyze the data and hold a meeting to decide whether to use Zhang Yu."

True Monarch Celestial Seal nodded slightly, thinking he had been too hasty. True Monarch Magnetic Pole's approach was more prudent. They should gather more data and let Zhang Yu cool off in the meantime.

Meanwhile, Jade Nectar Maiden Forty-Eight watched Zhang Yu's departing figure, thinking, "He's someone who can trigger the mutual non-interference list."

"I wonder what his circumstances are... Could he be somewhat like me?"

On the way out of the Artifact Refinement Laboratory, Yu Xinghan kept pressing Zhang Yu about his experience inside. Finally, he said with envy, "Ah, you're so lucky! You managed to boost your Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power so much in one go."

Zhang Yu replied, "I'd rather not have this kind of luck-driven improvement."

He sighed, "Cultivation is ultimately about self-reliance. The power you gain through your own hard work, step by step, is the best and most solid."

Zhang Yu returned to the construction site and resumed his work.

Although the experiment hadn't brought him any direct rewards, it had given him a legitimate reason to openly display his level 15 Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

The construction site now echoed with thunderous roars. Under the tearing force of invisible power, the entire mountain range abruptly crumbled and collapsed, rising skyward like a black dragon that blotted out the sun.

Zhao Tianxing, Mo Tianyi, Hu Yuntao, and the other workers watched this cataclysmic scene in stunned silence.

Gazing at Zhang Yu standing atop the black dragon in the sky, his mere gestures causing the earth to tremble and mountains to shake, Zhao Tianxing thought to himself, "Zhang Yu... he's grown so much stronger again."

Recalling the days when Zhang Yu used to share meals with him in high school, Zhao Tianxing felt a deep sense of wistfulness. "Without realizing it, Zhang Yu has already reached a level beyond our wildest dreams."

Having pushed his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to level 15, Zhang Yu now felt completely at ease, as if he had been freed from a cramped cage into a spacious one. "Finally, I can shed some of these constraints and unleash more of my true potential."

Just then, Director Gao sent him a message inquiring about the experiment. Zhang Yu repeated the explanation he had given to True Monarch Celestial Seal. Director Gao asked Zhang Yu to meet him the next day for a power assessment.

This wasn't because Director Gao distrusted Zhang Yu. With True Monarch Celestial Seal's endorsement and the presence of True Monarch Magnetic Pole, he believed Zhang Yu's power surge stemmed from the experiment. His concern was whether this rapid growth might have adverse side effects, hence the need for testing.

In the days that followed, news of Zhang Yu's participation in the experiment and subsequent power surge, culminating in his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power reaching level 15, spread like wildfire through the Civil Engineering Department. He became the envy of everyone.

Zhang Yu remained unfazed by this, after all, this power was the result of his own relentless training.

He continued his daily routine of studying, cultivating, and working overtime, steadily accumulating his strength.

In the Artifact Refinement Laboratory that day,

a violent surge of lightning erupted, only to be tightly restrained by the surrounding equipment.

Moments later, a thumb-sized metallic square seal materialized before Zhang Yu.

This was the new magical artifact he had crafted, called the Thunder-Suppressing Seal. It could absorb and release lightning, forming thunderbolts for defense.

Especially against ranged attacks like Flying Swords, it could unleash instantaneous lightning strikes to deflect their trajectories and neutralize the force of their Sword Intent.

With multiple Thunder-Suppressing Seals, he could even form small-scale Formations, weaving layers of thunderous nets for defense.

Zhang Yu had crafted this Thunder-Suppressing Seal to compensate for his lack of Flying Sword defense capabilities, preparing for his upcoming confrontation with Heavenly Sword University.

"My fundamental stats have reached the Foundation Establishment Limit."

"But in terms of actual combat strength, I'm still far from reaching the Foundation Establishment Limit."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "A student who has only mastered one military-grade cultivation technique would likely only be considered in the third tier of the Ten Greats Undergraduates."

"To reach the pinnacle of university students, I need to master military-grade magical artifacts, military-grade Bionics, and more military-grade powers."

However, Zhang Yu understood that for someone who had already mastered the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, the Civil Engineering Department could hardly offer him further advancement.

"To master military-grade magical artifacts, military-grade Bionics, and even more military-grade cultivation techniques, I must transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department."

At this moment, Zhang Yu's accumulation in artifact crafting, aside from upgrading his magical artifacts to enhance his strength, was also preparing him for his future studies in the Artifact Refinement Department.

"In just over half a year, it'll be time to transfer departments."

"I hope everything goes smoothly."

Just then, Zhang Yu received a message from True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Go to the Artifact Refinement Laboratory."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "True Monarch Celestial Seal needs to speak with you."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Please cooperate with his work as much as possible."

Since Zhang Yu and Yu Xinghan's test, the project team had arranged numerous subsequent trials, but none succeeded.

These prolonged experiments, coupled with the project team's lack of progress in deciphering the Yin Artifact, led to growing discontent. Some even suggested replacing the project's lead.

It was at this critical moment that news broke: Zhang Yu, from the Civil Engineering Department, had advanced his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to level 15. This breakthrough was hailed as a significant achievement in the Yin Artifact decryption project.

In the laboratory, True Monarch Celestial Seal addressed Zhang Yu: "The progress you've made in your Cultivation Art during these experiments demonstrates our university's advancement in Yin Artifact technology, placing us at the forefront of inter-institutional research."

"Upon learning of this success, the Principals have placed high hopes on this project."

"In particular, Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations has issued directives urging us to redouble our efforts and expedite the practical application of this technology."

Zhang Yu's heart stirred at these words. No longer a freshman, he was now well-versed in the university's affairs and its key figures.

He knew that Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations was one of the three Soul Transformation experts at Myriad Laws University, overseeing all research projects related to Immortal Dao Technology. From approving large-scale research proposals to forming project teams and commercializing technological breakthroughs, everything fell under his purview.

Yan Qianji, the Artifact Refinement Department's prodigy, was Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations's disciple.

"Even Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations is taking an interest in this project?" Zhang Yu thought, inwardly troubled. His success with the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power had absolutely nothing to do with Myriad Laws University's Dual Cultivation technology. What would happen when the truth came out?

True Monarch Celestial Seal mused, "This is troublesome. Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Dual Cultivation techniques aren't easily cracked. The artifact spirit is already uncooperative. Forcing a breakthrough might lead to data loss."

"We should run a few more tests," he decided, resolving to arrange further trials for Zhang Yu to gather more data.

But just as they finalized the terms and prepared to begin, they noticed the Yin Artifact circling Zhang Yu without activating.

"Hmm?" True Monarch Celestial Seal paused, slightly surprised. He channeled another surge of Magic Power, but the Yin Artifact still refused to engage.

"What's going on?" True Monarch Celestial Seal wondered, his confusion growing. "Why won't it activate?"

Zhang Yu, observing the Yin Artifact circling erratically, also sensed something was amiss. Is it malfunctioning? he thought. It seems Myriad Laws University's technology in this area is still immature.

True Monarch Celestial Seal repeatedly tried to activate the artifact, his curiosity deepening as it remained unresponsive. "It's not even detecting him? This is unprecedented."

When facing Zhang Yu, this Yin Artifact should either engage in Dual Cultivation to enhance his cultivation or remain completely dormant. Why is it exhibiting this strange behavior?

Suddenly, as True Monarch Celestial Seal persisted, the Yin Artifact seemed to reach its limit. With a whoosh, it plunged directly into Zhang Yu's palm.

Jade Nectar Maiden Forty-Eight thought, How annoying. Doesn't he know he's on the prohibited list?

Whatever. Let him try it himself. He'll understand once he's blocked.

Zhang Yu held the rhombus-shaped crystal in his hand, looking at True Monarch Celestial Seal with a puzzled expression. "What's happening?"

True Monarch Celestial Seal stroked his chin, pondering for a moment. Could it be that this Yin Artifact wants Zhang Yu to activate it manually? To use it himself?
