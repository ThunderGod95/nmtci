# Chapter 92: Advanced Experience from a Key High School

Zhang Yu’s willingness to teach a trial class stemmed from his confidence in his instructional abilities.

This confidence came not only from the fact that the three techniques he was to explain—Limitless Cloud Hand, Excavator Palm, and Sports Car Legs—had all reached level 10.

It was also rooted in the exquisite understanding of mana control he had gained after advancing both the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method and the Limitless Cloud Hand to level 10.

And then there was the profound understanding of physical structure and muscular exertion he had acquired after his Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms and Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi reached level 10.

Of course, the experience and insights gained from level 10 techniques like Limitless Cloud Hand, the Imperishable Seal Art, the Dragonback Mountain Toppler Hand, and the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art had also caused his own martial arts skills to rise steadily.

Without even realizing it, Zhang Yu's control over his mana, his body, and his martial techniques had already reached a level he had never dared to imagine before.

Furthermore, all of these breakthroughs had been achieved within the last two months.

This meant that, at this very moment, he still vividly recalled the feeling of advancing each of these techniques from level 1 to level 10.

He still remembered the many difficulties, questions, and points of confusion he had encountered as a novice cultivating these arts.

Thus, with his current perception and experience, when he now explained the various techniques within the Limitless Cloud Hand, he could often pinpoint the essentials in just a few words, casually offering insights that would take others years of effort to comprehend.

Cai Tou, who had ‘Daily Lesson’ tattooed on his arm, had only cultivated the Limitless Cloud Hand to level 8. After listening to Zhang Yu for just a few minutes, he felt a sense of sudden enlightenment, as if a great weight had been lifted from his mind, and even had the urge to begin cultivating right there on the spot.

In particular, Zhang Yu's guidance and insights regarding the level 8 Limitless Cloud Hand made Cai Tou feel as though he were speaking directly to his heart.

"Excellent, truly excellent. That was an incredible explanation," Cai Tou said, his face alight with excitement. "If Teacher Ma ever offers a course on the Limitless Cloud Hand, I will definitely sign up."

Nearby, Da Chan and Che Nu exchanged a glance, a flicker of surprise in their eyes; they hadn't expected Cai Tou to hold this Ma Yunteng in such high regard.

After receiving Cai Tou's praise, Zhang Yu looked toward Che Nu and said, "Then I will next explain Sports Car Legs…"

But just then, Black Crow, who was standing to the side, suddenly interjected, "Teacher Ma, your lecture is excellent, but if you could add just one more little thing, it would be even more popular here."

Zhang Yu asked curiously, "Add what?"

Black Crow replied, "A little of the key high school teaching style."

As Zhang Yu was wondering what a key high school’s teaching experience entailed, the doll hanging on his chest explained, "Just treat them the way your teachers treated you when you were at a key high school. Bring out the experience of how you were educated there."

Zhang Yu grew thoughtful, then looked at the few people before him and asked, "When I was in key high school, I taught only sterilized students. I was wondering, are the three of you teachers currently in a sterilized state, or have you already undergone reversal surgery?"

Cai Tou spoke with some embarrassment, "We all attended regular high schools; sterilization wasn't required back then."

Zhang Yu let out an "oh."

And as Cai Tou, Che Nu, and Da Chan looked at Zhang Yu, who presumably had been sterilized, and then at themselves, who had not, they suddenly felt as if they were a class below him.

Zhang Yu decided to draw upon his experiences from White Dragon High School as well, asking, "I see we have restrooms here. Do teachers and students need to use them? Is it necessary to consider students' restroom needs during class?"

The three exchanged glances before nodding in unison.

Zhang Yu asked with curiosity, "There’s another question I've always wanted to ask. Can’t you choose the flavor of the intellect-enhancement agent here? I don't think I've ever smelled it."

Cai Tou replied, a bit awkwardly, "Our facilities are limited. We don't add intellect-enhancement agents to the air circulation system."

Black Crow, however, watched with gleaming eyes, thinking to himself, _Yes, yes, that's the vibe. The smell of a key high school humiliating its students._

Subsequently, Zhang Yu became increasingly adept at integrating the high school teaching experience into his lessons.

He thought to himself, _Hmm, it's not too difficult. I just have to repeat how the teachers at Songyang High School normally discriminate against low-scoring students, and how the people from White Dragon and Purple Cloud speak to those from Songyang._

And as Zhang Yu continued to explain Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs.

Che Nu and Da Chan discovered that Zhang Yu's understanding of Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs was in no way inferior to their own, and that he possessed a unique comprehension of muscular exertion and mana circulation.

What surprised them even more was that Zhang Yu knew all the various key points for cultivating these two techniques from level 1 to level 10 by heart, as if he had only just recently broken through.

But the two of them knew, of course, that it was impossible for him to have just recently cultivated these level 10 techniques. The only explanation was that his teaching experience was exceedingly rich, that he had guided all sorts of students through breakthroughs at different levels of these two techniques.

Che Nu cupped her hands, her previously cool expression vanishing as her face filled with admiration.

"Your teaching quality is exceptionally high, and your teaching style is mature. You are more than qualified to teach here."

Although Da Chan, standing to the side, did not speak, he nodded slightly, endorsing Che Nu's statement.

After all, in the dark world of tutoring, teaching quality was king, and everyone in the gang admired those with strong lecturing skills.

As for Zhang Yu's teaching style, it was so authentic it needed no further comment. Just the aura of someone who could weave the score-based hierarchy into his conversation, the casualness of his words, showed that he not only had a high level of martial arts but was also a graduate of a proper key high school.

Black Crow thought to himself, _If we advertise him under the banner of a retired key high school teacher, we could definitely recruit a lot of students._

But the most surprised person on the scene, from beginning to end, was certainly not these three teachers from the Dark Learning Gang, nor was it Black Crow off to the side.

It was the doll hanging on Zhang Yu's chest.

_This guy only learned Excavator Palm a few days ago!_

_It seems he doesn't just learn techniques quickly; it's not just about speed, but a true and thorough comprehension. He can even fuse various techniques into one, truly mastering the power within._

_Damn it…_ the doll thought inwardly. _How on earth was this potential unlocked? Could it be that, without my knowledge, I have actually, inadvertently, mastered such a terrifying method for stimulating potential, and in doing so, created this peerless prodigy, Zhang Yu?_

_Doesn't that mean I have the aptitude to become an evil god king?_

_Could that be the very reason why I was betrayed by others?_

Zhang Yu then briefly demonstrated his teaching proficiency in the Crane Claw and the Elevator Leap, which were naturally met with approval, causing everyone to admire the breadth of his knowledge even more.

After seeing off Cai Tou and the other two, Black Crow began to discuss the specific details of the classes with Zhang Yu.

In the end, a course schedule was determined based on Black Crow's suggestions, the doll's experienced input, and Zhang Yu's own considerations.

But the first thing Black Crow brought up was the issue of taxes.

He explained, "It's no problem if you wish to remain anonymous. You don't have to purchase the rights to disseminate or teach the techniques, but taxes must be paid. We will withhold them on your behalf."

"It's just that taxes are too important. In the past, some gangs didn't bother with it, letting teachers file their own taxes. But then they encountered some daredevil who secretly evaded them. He was eventually discovered by a righteous god, and the entire gang was captured as one. The whole gang went bankrupt and was saddled with a lifetime of fines they could never repay. They're still working overtime in a corporation to pay off the debt. I hear their overtime is already scheduled out for the next 200 years…"

As Black Crow spoke, a trace of fear showed in his eyes.

"So, we cannot be careless when it comes to paying taxes. My gang will take full responsibility for paying them for you, so you won't have to worry about it."

"The tutoring fees we calculate for you are always figured after our commission and taxes."

Aside from the Limitless Cloud Hand, the most profitable courses were naturally Excavator Palm, Crane Claw, Sports Car Legs, and the Elevator Leap.

Black Crow said, "So, Teacher Ma, when would be a convenient time for you to start teaching?"

Zhang Yu replied, "The sooner, the better."

Black Crow smiled slightly. "Alright then. I happen to have an Excavator Palm class that needs a teacher. There are currently 59 students enrolled. Each class is 60 minutes long, and we will pay you 6,500 per class. For now, we'll schedule 10 classes a week. How does that sound?"

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's heart skipped a beat, and he couldn't help but feel his breath catch in his throat.

He thought to himself, _Ten classes a week, that's 65,000? Damn, the dark world of tutoring is really lucrative!_

But Black Crow, seeing Zhang Yu remain silent, assumed he thought the amount was too low. After all, an expert who could cultivate multiple martial arts to level 10, someone at the absolute peak of Qi Refinement, would surely have high income and expenses.

So Black Crow said, "You are new here, after all. Once your teaching quality is recognized, we can definitely arrange more classes and more students. Your income will certainly see a big increase then."

Zhang Yu nodded in agreement, suppressing the eagerness in his heart.

"When do the classes start?"

"Tomorrow."

…

That evening, after leaving the compound, Zhang Yu let out a slight sigh of relief.

He thought to himself, _This way, I’ll have an income of 65,000 a week. If I do well and more classes are arranged, my income could be even higher._

At this thought, Zhang Yu truly breathed a sigh of relief, feeling a great deal of the financial pressure on his shoulders lift.

"With this, I'll have the money to eat Crimson Marrow Primordial Pills, and my body tempering can finally improve quickly. Participating in the sports competition shouldn't be a problem anymore."

Just then, the doll on his chest spoke up, "Well? I didn't lie to you, did I? What kind of legitimate job makes money as fast as running with the underworld?"

"And I know this Kunxu's various underworlds and dark worlds like the back of my hand. With me helping you, your chances of climbing higher will only increase."

Zhang Yu did not reply, but he had to admit that learning about the dark worlds through this evil god was indeed beneficial to his path of the Immortal Dao.

On the way back, the doll, in an effort to show its presence or perhaps to continue demonstrating its importance to Zhang Yu, reminded him.

"Remember this, Zhang Yu. In this illegal tutoring business, the most important thing is that you can't trust anyone. Also, since you're in this line of work, don't you ever feel sorry for the people who buy your courses."

"Almost everyone who comes to the dark world of tutoring to buy courses is dirt poor, but don't you mind whether their money comes from loans, selling their house, or mortgaging their organs. They buy, we sell. It's not like we forced them. If they go bankrupt or jump off a building later, that's their own fault for being poor and still trying to cultivate…"

Over the next few days, Zhang Yu cultivated at school during the day, and at night he either cultivated in the abandoned building or taught classes at the Dark Learning Gang's compound. He finally saved up enough money to purchase another Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill, gradually beginning a routine of consuming one every few days.
