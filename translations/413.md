# Chapter 413: Golden Armor Warrior

As Zhang Yu manipulated his Gang Qi and the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill, the Golden Divine General before him shuddered, then began to unleash a series of martial dao techniques with its fists and feet.

With each strike, the Formless Warrior, now infused with the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill, emitted thunderous roars, its power far surpassing that of a standard Formless Warrior.

Zhang Yu mused inwardly, "After being shaped into liquid metal, the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill has become the strongest metal I can currently create."

"Its defensive strength far exceeds that of my normal flesh and blood."

"Perhaps only in a near-death state, enhanced by the Civil Engineering Holy Body, could my pure defensive capabilities surpass those of the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill."

Observing the Golden Armor-clad Formless Warrior before him, Zhang Yu decided to name these Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill-enhanced Formless Warriors "Golden Armor Warriors."

"If we combine Golden Armor Warriors with Azure Heaven Sand, a single one could likely rival ten ordinary Formless Warriors."

"If I combine this with the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force..."

Zhang Yu realized his Martial Dao Holy Body could also enhance his Gang Qi, which meant it could also enhance the Golden Armor Warrior.

"In a close-quarters fight, even ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators might not stand a chance against my Golden Armor Warrior."

But a moment later, Zhang Yu suppressed these thoughts.

"What am I thinking? What's the point of being good at fighting?"

"Let's test its work efficiency instead."

With a thought, the golden armor covering the Golden Armor Warrior's body instantly shrank, replaced by a massive golden hammer in its hand.

As the Gang Qi surged, the golden hammer whistled through the air, leaving afterimages as the Golden Armor Warrior swung it in a blur.

"The Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill can be shaped into various tools as needed. This will definitely boost work efficiency."

While Zhang Yu pondered, the golden hammer in the Golden Armor Warrior's hand had already transformed again, morphing into a variety of different tools.

The days passed, and Zhang Yu continued to immerse himself in study and cultivation.

One day, while Zhang Yu was cultivating in the Spirit Realm's simulation laboratory within his dormitory, he was abruptly pulled out by a barrage of harassing messages.

A tall, slender girl stood before him, her clothing barely covering her body. She looked at him and asked, "What do you think?"

Zhang Yu hesitated, "You... you're Wen Wuya?"

Wen Wuya, who had manifested as a Spirit Realm Projection, nodded and flexed her pectoral muscles. "Zhang Yu, you were right. Since I became a woman, Bai Zhenzhen and I have been talking much more."

"But I think we can optimize this further. Help me adjust my appearance to match Bai Zhenzhen's ideal type."

Zhang Yu sighed helplessly, "But... how am I supposed to help you with that?"

Wen Wuya replied casually, "I've shared the projection's appearance customization feature with you."

"Just make the adjustments directly on my body. I'll use the adjusted model as a reference for the Transformation Surgery later."

Zhang Yu really didn't want to look at Wen Wuya's physical body any longer. He turned his head away and said, "Isn't that too much trouble?"

Wen Wuya replied casually, "What's the trouble? Some people who enjoy changing their appearance do it dozens of times a day. Swapping out a physical body isn't a big deal, let alone just patching it up?"

Zhang Yu couldn't comprehend the mindset of the wealthy. He said helplessly, "I'm not very good at this kind of thing."

Wen Wuya said, "10 Spirit Coins."

Zhang Yu replied solemnly, "I'll do my best."

Wen Wuya waved his hand. "Alright, hurry up. If you think any dimensions are off, just gesture on my Spirit Realm Projection."

"Yes, adjust it like that."

"Oh? So that's how it is? Bai Zhenzhen likes women with these proportions?"

"It's a standard of classical beauty. Some Soul Transformation cultivators still prefer it."

"Is Bai Zhenzhen a retro enthusiast?"

Kunxu Second Layer.

Shuizhou Monsterfolk Vocational Academy.

Zhang Yu walked down the street, curiously asking Shi Yunxiang beside him, "This project is for the Pharmaceutical Factory, right? But I didn't see many medicinal fields around here on my way over."

Shi Yunxiang walked beside Zhang Yu, and as they passed, the surrounding monsterfolk retreated respectfully to the sides, their gazes filled with reverence.

What surprised Zhang Yu, however, was that the monsterfolk here seemed to be predominantly of Rat Monster lineage.

Everywhere he looked, upright, large rats were scurrying about the streets.

Hearing Zhang Yu's question, Shi Yunxiang smiled faintly and glanced at the Rat Monsterfolk nearby. "Can anyone tell me what the local specialty is?" he asked casually.

A Rat Monster raised its hand. Shi Yunxiang nodded and turned to Zhang Yu. "See? That's the specialty."

Zhang Yu blinked. "Huh?"

Shi Yunxiang continued, "It's not just plants that serve as raw materials for medicine. Some animals are also used in pharmaceutical production."

Zhang Yu couldn't help but glance at the surrounding Rat Monsters. "Do they process these Rat Monsters?"

Shi Yunxiang waved his hand dismissively. "Rat Monsterfolk are still far too expensive compared to Rat Demon Beasts."

Zhang Yu nodded, thinking that while this reason was still quite Kunxu-esque, it was at least more palatable than using Rat Monsters for processing. After all, Demon Beasts were closer to animals and lacked true wisdom.

Shi Yunxiang continued, "The Rat Monster component in the medicine only accounts for about one percent. The bulk still comes from Demon Beasts, allowing us to claim it uses Shuizhou Rat Monsters."

Seeing Shi Yunxiang's nonchalant expression, Zhang Yu couldn't help but ask, "Doesn't using monsterfolk to process medicine bother you?"

Shi Yunxiang immediately cut him off, his tone serious. "Lion Monsters are Lion Monsters, and Rat Monsters are Rat Monsters. Though both belong to the monsterfolk, we're essentially two completely different species."

Through Shi Yunxiang's repeated explanations, Zhang Yu gradually understood that while the monsterfolk appeared united to outsiders, deep internal hierarchies of contempt existed between different monster races.

Weakened groups like the Rat Monsters occupied the bottom rung of this hierarchy, facing disdain from superior races like the Lion Monsters and Tiger Monsters.

Shi Yunxiang cautioned, "There are many monsterfolk here. You must never conflate their bloodlines. It's a major taboo among them."

Lady Fortune chuckled. "Ultimately, all monsters — whether wolf monsters, bird monsters, insect monsters, or fish monsters — are lumped together as monsterfolk. This is simply the arrogance of the Human Race, their instinctive prejudice against all non-human races. The various groups within the monsterfolk only band together out of necessity, to survive in Kunxu."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly, realizing the situation within the monsterfolk was far more complex than he had previously imagined.

Upon arriving at the construction site outside the city, Zhang Yu and Shi Yunxiang took over from the monsterfolk workers already present and began their work.

Shi Yunxiang's figure flashed back and forth as he transported massive quantities of building materials.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu swept his Gang Qi across the area, transforming it into twenty Formless Warriors that began working like a miniature construction team.

Watching this, Shi Yunxiang marveled inwardly, "Zhang Yu's progress is astonishingly rapid. At this rate, he might actually lead us to the top five in the next Civil Engineering Competition!"

Just then, a massive tremor shook the ground as a colossal beast shadow, over ten meters tall, charged into the construction site.

Shi Yunxiang's gaze swept over the scene, his thoughts racing: "A Foundation Establishment Stage Demon Beast from the ranch? How did it escape?"

"With such formidable power... even a Level 20 physical strength might struggle to withstand a direct assault."

Shi Yunxiang knew that even with equal physical strength, Demon Beasts with naturally larger bodies would inevitably possess superior physical power.

"We can't let it get near the construction site."

Just as Shi Yunxiang was about to rush out to intercept the Demon Beast, a golden figure flashed past like lightning and landed before the creature.

With a thunderous crash, the golden figure collided violently with the Demon Beast, standing firm without budging an inch. Instead, it sent the charging beast recoiling backward.

The one who had intervened was none other than the Golden Armor Warrior summoned by Zhang Yu.

The Demon Beast's claws and fangs tore at the golden armor, producing a grating, ear-splitting sound, yet its attacks proved utterly ineffective.

Empowered by the Level 20 Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill and the Martial Dao Holy Body, the Golden Armor Warrior completely ignored the Demon Beast's onslaught. Its surging power was relentlessly devoured by the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force and then redirected back at the creature.

The Golden Armor Warrior stood like an indestructible Vajra puppet, enduring the Demon Beast's frenzied assaults without flinching. With each punch, it drove the Foundation Establishment Demon Beast back dozens of meters. Finally, the beast collapsed to the ground, its eyes clear and no longer daring to rise.

Nearby, several monsterfolk workers hurried over, their eyes filled with awe as they gazed at the prostrate Demon Beast and the Golden Armor Warrior standing before it.

"I heard students from Myriad Laws University are working on this project."

"To subdue a Foundation Establishment Stage Demon Beast so quickly... they truly live up to their reputation as students of the Ten Greats."

But as they moved to apologize to the Golden Armor Warrior, they watched in astonishment as it transformed into a stream of golden and white Qi, flowing back toward the construction site.

"Just a Gang Qi avatar?"

"Is this the power of the Ten Greats Students? Such strength from a mere wisp of Gang Qi?"

After completing the Shuizhou Monsterfolk Cooperation Project, Zhang Yu immediately moved on to his next project.

He could be seen overseeing the construction of dormitories for Vocational College students.

The Golden Armor Warrior's figure flashed through the Magical Artifact Factory, rushing to repair fiend energy leaks.

Deep within underground tombs, Zhang Yu's silhouette flickered as he excavated Corpse Components.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu continued to hone his Artifact Refinement Technique, seizing every moment back in Myriad Laws University City to immerse himself in the Spirit Realm simulation laboratory.

June.

Artifact Refinement Laboratory.

Zhang Yu was refining an Earthly Fiend Bottle.

Although he had mastered many new Artifact Refinement Techniques recently, he hadn't crafted physical artifacts for each one, as his funds were limited.

He chose the Earthly Fiend Bottle because...

"Once refined," Zhang Yu thought, "this bottle can collect fiend energy to combat environmental pollution, contain and refine materials, and even process Coagulated Earth to further increase my work income."

"It's like adding wings to a tiger."

However, refining the Earthly Fiend Bottle involved handling and purifying Earthly Fiend Qi, a highly dangerous process.

Even with Zhang Yu's exceptional physique and resistance, he remained extremely cautious, daring not to let his guard down for a moment.

Several hours later, a flash of brilliant light erupted, and a bottle, seemingly crafted from crystal-clear glass, materialized in Zhang Yu's palm.

Its surface was etched with intricate Magic Power Circuits, which occasionally pulsed with faint blue-white light.

Within the bottle, a swirling mass of electric-like fiend energy surged back and forth like a living entity.

As Zhang Yu's gaze swept over the Earthly Fiend Bottle, lines of relevant parameters appeared in his Bionic Eye:

"Remaining Magic Power: 99%, Usable Time: 3 hours 45 minutes."

"Remaining Earthly Fiend Element: 100%..."

"Remaining Containment Capacity: 100%..."

"Current Operating Mode: Idle"

Zhang Yu glanced at the parameters and smiled faintly. "A Level 20 Earthly Fiend Bottle... Success."
