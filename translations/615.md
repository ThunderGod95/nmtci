# Chapter 615: The More You Watch, the Higher the Threshold

"A true realm of the strong, is it?"

Zhang Yu's gaze swept across the advertisement bidding rankings he had received, where he was listed third, with the highest bid for his next advertisement at 650 Spirit Coins.

Of course, Zhang Yu knew he wouldn't receive the full 650 Spirit Coins. After all, the school would take its share, and taxes would have to be paid.

Zhang Yu mentally calculated, "After deductions, I should end up with around 200 Spirit Coins."

Dao Qiankun, standing beside him, continued his guidance: "While named techniques are powerful, they're not without limitations."

"Firstly, there are situational restrictions. You can't just spam the technique in any corner and expect to profit."

"Secondly, named techniques aim for positive impact. If using one leads to defeat or poor performance, the payout will decrease. The more failures, the less money you'll receive, eventually leading to the cancellation of the naming rights."

"So, while each use of a named technique earns you money, making it seem like you grow stronger with each battle, in the long run, you must never overuse them. Only deploy a technique when you're reasonably certain it will be effective."

"Especially with your signature move this time, the company might only buy one match. If you want a long-term contract, you'll need to deliver a spectacular performance in this one."

Zhang Yu listened intently to Dao Qiankun's explanation, knowing the latter had far more experience in these matters.

Dao Qiankun, observing Zhang Yu's attentive demeanor, grew increasingly pleased with his humility and willingness to follow instructions.

He particularly recalled Zhang Yu's interview statement about elevating him to the throne, as well as the youth's desperate efforts to create opportunities for him in the previous team tournament. These actions further endeared Zhang Yu to Dao Qiankun.

"Send me the list of available endorsements," Dao Qiankun said. "I'll help you choose."

Zhang Yu immediately forwarded the document True Monarch Tranquility had sent him.

Dao Qiankun projected the document onto a screen, crossing out company names as he explained, "Endorsements aren't just about the money. You need to consider their prestige and how they align with your image."

"Think of it like choosing a cultivation art. You can't be shortsighted, focusing only on immediate gains. You must consider the art's long-term potential and whether it truly suits you."

"It's the same with endorsements. Many companies offer lucrative deals, but accepting them could damage your personal brand and even hinder your Immortal Dao Potential..."

"For school administrators, however, their primary concern is quarterly revenue, not your future prospects."

As Dao Qiankun spoke, he crossed out several companies, including Extreme Tiger Brand and Monster Path Pavilion.

From the remaining brands, he circled Myriad Paths Artisan Sect, Lingxiao Intelligent Manufacturing, and Cloudy Peak Academy.

"I've circled these companies for you," he continued. "Ask them to submit advertising proposals and specific plans for naming rights. Then, choose one that aligns best with your vision."

"Naming rights not only affect the company's image but also influence how you, the technique's user, will perform it."

"The next match is in a week. That's neither much time nor little. You need to negotiate with them urgently..."

Zhang Yu felt he had gained immense insight from Dao Qiankun's advice. After discussing it further with True Monarch Tranquility, he sent his company preferences and awaited their response.

Meanwhile, inside the Heavenly Sword University's Flying Boat, Bai Zhenzhen sat cross-legged in a secluded chamber, watching crimson sword qi flicker and surge before her.

Her mind replayed scenes from the previous match. During Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing's final clash, Bai Zhenzhen had desperately tried to unleash greater power to aid him.

Even before the battle began, Zhang Yu had urged her to secretly inject sword qi into him to ambush Kuang Tianqing. But despite repeated attempts, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't summon that destructive black sword qi.

Later, as she watched Zhang Yu inch closer to death, her sword qi finally transformed into that life-annihilating, all-severing black sword qi once more. Yet even the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation couldn't transmit this dark energy, and the sword qi even began to damage the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword itself.

After the match, Bai Zhenzhen dared not approach Zhang Yu, fearing that her fluctuating emotions might inadvertently kill the already critically injured Zhang Yu.

"I'm so useless..."

Bai Zhenzhen clenched her fists. "I couldn't stop them from humiliating Zhang Yu, nor could I help him collect fees for dual cultivation."

"The Demonic Path is a dead end, and the Righteous Path leads nowhere either."

"Whether in ancient times or the modern era, I'm utterly useless — completely lacking the bearing of a Heavenly Sword University student or a Soul Transformation disciple."

Yet this team tournament hadn't been entirely without benefit for Bai Zhenzhen.

As she watched Zhang Yu approach his doom step by step, her innate talent and the adaptive power of her Divine Spiritual Root allowed her to gradually gain some control over the ever-shifting sword qi of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao. She could now maintain a degree of rationality while unleashing her sword qi.

At that moment, Bai Zhenzhen finally grasped some of the profound mysteries of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao.

"Only by nurturing extreme emotions within one's heart — by experiencing love, hatred, and all the passions of life — can one truly unleash the ultimate techniques of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"For only those whose emotions run deep as the sea, those who live with utter sincerity and passion, can unleash a sword strike that severs all affection and extinguishes all vitality."

"To wield the emotionless through emotion — that is the essence of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao..."

A video began playing within Bai Zhenzhen's Bionic Eye: her first encounter with Kuang Tianqing, and the moment she witnessed Kuang Tianqing begin to humiliate Zhang Yu.

Heartache...

The more Bai Zhenzhen watched, the tighter her chest grew, and the more breathless and agitated she became. The crimson sword qi that had surrounded her gradually transformed under this surge of emotion, mutating into the ominous black sword qi imbued with the aura of annihilation.

"As expected..."

Bai Zhenzhen opened her palm, her left eye watching the surging black sword qi within, while her right eye focused on the struggling figure of Zhang Yu in the video. She felt the sword qi growing even more turbulent.

"This is what it means to wield the emotionless with emotion. Because of my deep bond with Zhang Yu, I can unleash this life-annihilating sword strike fueled by his suffering."

Taking a deep breath, Bai Zhenzhen closed the video. The black sword qi gradually reverted to its crimson hue.

After a moment's thought, she filed the video file titled "Kuang Tianqing vs. Zhang Yu (Part 1)" into a secret directory.

She vowed inwardly, "I will remember every single person who humiliated Zhang Yu. You will all serve as fuel for my Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

Just as Bai Zhenzhen was thinking this, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' voice echoed in her mind: "Still cultivating the Sword Dao?"

"If you believe that watching videos and reliving those unforgettable moments will ignite the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao... you've already strayed from the true path."

Bai Zhenzhen's gaze sharpened. "Master, what do you mean?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions replied calmly, "One of your senior brothers once tried this method."

"At first, he was very successful. He would watch videos while fighting, repeatedly channeling his sword qi to defeat his opponents. For a time, he stood unrivaled among the Ten Greats, claiming numerous tournament championships."

"But the human heart is ever-changing, and human emotions are no different. The more videos he watched, the higher his threshold became."

"Initially, even ordinary videos insulting his wife could trigger his sword qi."

"But after prolonged exposure, he gradually grew numb. He needed increasingly extreme stimuli — more degrading and insulting videos — to trigger his sword qi."

"Eventually, he even resorted to videos featuring monsterfolk and Junior College Students... just to trigger his sword qi."

"Step by step, he pushed himself further... until one day, he crossed his own bottom line, exceeded the limits of his endurance, and descended into madness."

The Divine Monarch Seven Emotions spoke with chilling cruelty: "That's why I say this is a crooked path. The end of this crooked path is demonic possession — utter madness."

Bai Zhenzhen's heart leaped at these words. "Then at least... it won't affect me in the short term," she argued.

Gritting her teeth, she declared, "I'll be careful to control my usage. I won't use this ultimate technique lightly."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions sighed. "Take care of yourself."

Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, "If my Divine Spiritual Root helps me adapt, could it aid me in progressing smoothly?"

Thinking of her Divine Spiritual Root reminded Bai Zhenzhen of the time she had exchanged Spiritual Roots with Zhang Yu beneath the arena during the Civil Engineering Competition.

Though it had been a fleeting moment, it had left Bai Zhenzhen with an extraordinary sensation, and she had been eagerly anticipating their next exchange.

"Alas, exchanging Divine Spiritual Roots now would be too conspicuous," she thought. "Activating sword qi would immediately draw attention."

"Especially since this place is being closely watched by several Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs. If a Divine Monarch were to notice Yu Zi's Divine Spiritual Root..."

Although she longed to exchange Divine Spiritual Roots with Zhang Yu to enhance both their strength, Bai Zhenzhen knew the timing wasn't right. She needed to find a safer, more discreet opportunity.

Suppressing her urge to exchange Spiritual Roots, Bai Zhenzhen turned her gaze to the flying sword beside her.

This flying sword, chosen from Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' sword vault, remained elusive to her complete mastery, yet she could sense the immense power it contained.

"I can't use my ultimate move lightly, and there's no chance to exchange Spiritual Roots for now."

Bai Zhenzhen gazed at the flying sword before her, inwardly resolving, "The fastest way to enhance my combat power right now is to fully master this flying sword."

Deep within the Spirit Realm, True Person Starfire watched Li Xuelian's live text updates and Zhang Yu's post-match interview, a wave of complex emotions washing over him.

"I never imagined my name would one day spread among university students," True Person Starfire murmured. "I wonder what my old friends would think if they heard this."

"Father," Li Xuelian replied, "as Zhang Yu continues to climb higher — achieving Golden Core, perhaps even Nascent Soul — you might have a chance to return someday."

True Person Starfire shook his head. "My greatest fear is that someone might transfer their hatred for me onto Zhang Yu," he said. "Perhaps the boy shouldn't have mentioned my name."

"Father," Li Xuelian countered, "while some hate you, others remember you fondly. I doubt those who hate you would trouble Zhang Yu. As for those who remember you fondly... they might even extend him a helping hand."

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu returned to his Flying Boat, he found True Monarch Magnetic Pole's avatar already waiting there.

"Master!" Zhang Yu greeted her hastily, bowing respectfully. "What brings you here?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied coolly, "If I didn't come, my disciple would be mistaken for a student of the Civil Engineering Department."
