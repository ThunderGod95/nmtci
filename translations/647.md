# Chapter 647: This World... Has Gone Mad!

True Monarch Tranquility had already learned about the new capabilities of the Seven Absolutes Bionic after its modification during the Artifact Refinement Department's Nascent Soul stage refinement process.

To him, recreating phenomena like the sun's explosion and extreme heat using Immortal Dao Technology was hardly surprising.

After all, the sun above Kunxu Second Layer, known as the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness, had been crafted by Myriad Laws University.

Compared to the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness, Zhang Yu's Immortal Dao Sun was still far inferior.

If the Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness were the true sun, then Zhang Yu's Immortal Dao Sun could only be described as a small fireball.

Though both fundamentally used Immortal Dao Technology to replicate the sun, their power output, sustained duration, controllability, and area of effect differed by countless orders of magnitude. Naturally, the technological sophistication between them was worlds apart.

It was akin to comparing a matchstick to the military-grade cultivation technique Great Sun Manifestations — both produce fire, but their underlying principles and required expertise are vastly different.

True Monarch Tranquility was aware that the new Seven Absolutes Bionic, when synchronized with other military-grade magical artifacts, could achieve a synergistic effect greater than the sum of its parts, and that some creative applications for weaponization had earned the praise of several Nascent Soul True Monarchs in the Artifact Refinement Department.

However, none of these developments struck True Monarch Tranquility as particularly significant.

In contrast, Zhang Yu had consistently demonstrated remarkable growth potential since the Ten Greats League, improving with each battle. His fierce clash with Tian Shengong today showcased university-level prowess, hinting at a possibility of rivaling Kuang Tianqing. This was what truly concerned True Monarch Tranquility.

Even a slight possibility could disrupt the school's plans, draw the Principal's attention, and even provoke action from a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch.

Upon reading Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's message, True Monarch Tranquility realized his suspicions were correct.

"The Principal intends to double down on Zhang Yu in the final week, testing whether he can truly challenge Kuang Tianqing?"

"Beyond that, they likely want to confirm Zhang Yu's choice of Immortal Sect Technique."

"Just in case..." True Monarch Tranquility mused, "even if there's only a remote chance Zhang Yu wins the championship, we must prepare for that outcome."

These thoughts flashed through True Monarch Tranquility's mind like lightning. His gaze shifted to the other battle of the day, his Bionic Eye already locked onto the arena.

Though he considered the match between Kuang Tianqing and Bai Zhenzhen to be a foregone conclusion, he still intended to use it to gather more intelligence on Kuang Tianqing.

However, as he observed the battlefield and studied Bai Zhenzhen and Kuang Tianqing for some time, a flicker of surprise crossed his eyes.

True Monarch Tranquility murmured to himself, "The Reincarnation Group... have they made their move?"

---

When Bai Zhenzhen and Kuang Tianqing entered the battlefield, neither side immediately attacked.

Kuang Tianqing smiled warmly at Bai Zhenzhen. "Originally, my plan was to refine you into a flying sword during the first team tournament, to use against Dao Qiankun."

Her hand glided through her long hair as she sighed. "But Dao Qiankun died, and here you stand, about to fight me in the semifinals."

Bai Zhenzhen's long, platinum-blonde hair billowed in the wind like a burning flame of white gold. She glared coldly at Kuang Tianqing. "Kuang Tianqing, I should thank you."

"If not for your actions in the first team tournament, which made me realize my incompetence and acknowledge my worthlessness, I would never have made such progress in the time since."

"Ha ha." Kuang Tianqing laughed. "Then after today's battle, you'll thank me even more."

"Remember well everything I'm about to do to you."

"Watch closely as I devour you."

"It will be a memory you'll never forget."

Bai Zhenzhen flicked her sword, and a flying sword slowly floated before her. She said calmly, "You want to devour me?"

"Kuang Tianqing, to focus on the Immortal Dao and strive for the pinnacle of cultivation, I have long since severed my reproductive capabilities. Your tricks are useless against me."

Kuang Tianqing smiled faintly, spreading her fingers. A crystal-clear substance rose from her palm — a Yang Artifact Bionic.

"Severed your reproductive capabilities?" Kuang Tianqing said dismissively. "If merely severing one's reproductive capabilities could counter all dual cultivation techniques, you underestimate the Dual Cultivation Dao."

"A rootless person? Without weaknesses?"

Kuang Tianqing gently tapped the Yang Artifact Bionic before her. "If you have no weaknesses, I'll create them for you, then devour you completely."

"I'll seize all the progress you've made, all the power you've accumulated through your recent breakthroughs in the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

Bai Zhenzhen's gaze sharpened, her eyes burning with murderous intent as she glared at Kuang Tianqing. "If you think you can, come and try."

"Whether in mind or body, I have long since severed my reproductive capabilities."

"No matter how many weaknesses you try to impose on me, I will sever them all."

As their conversation intensified, so did their battle intent, causing the spiritual energy in the atmosphere to boil and gradually condense into raindrops.

In the next instant, Bai Zhenzhen's figure vanished, and countless invisible sword qi blades slashed toward Kuang Tianqing's position.

Though Bai Zhenzhen's physical form disappeared, Kuang Tianqing's eyes clearly perceived every detail: the turbulent air currents caused by her high-speed movements, the tremors in the ground, the flow of spiritual energy... everything was laid bare before her.

"I've long since deciphered your abilities."

"Within this combat model specifically designed for you..."

"Bai Zhenzhen, you have nowhere left to hide."

A thunderous collision erupted as their powers clashed, unleashing shockwaves that shook the air.

Simultaneously, Bai Zhenzhen locked her gaze unflinchingly on Kuang Tianqing, her eyes piercing through the illusion to reveal her true form. Within her body, the Bionic continuously purified spiritual energy, resisting the effects of the Illusion Art.

Bai Zhenzhen: "Kuang Tianqing, you're not the only one who's grown stronger on this journey."

"Your Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique is equally ineffective against me now."

The two women clashed fiercely, exchanging dozens of blows in an instant. Gradually, faint golden sparks began to flicker in the air.

These were countless strands of Bai Zhenzhen's hair, drifting down and gradually filling the battlefield.

From the moment she entered the arena, through their exchange of words, and throughout their intense battle, Bai Zhenzhen had been continuously releasing strands of her hair into the atmosphere.

Each strand of Bai Zhenzhen's hair was a sword artifact.

These nearly invisible strands now permeated the battlefield, yet remained under Bai Zhenzhen's control, each imbued with her sword qi.

Unnoticed, Kuang Tianqing found herself surrounded by a web of countless hair-thin swords.

In the blink of an eye, streams of sword qi erupted from the strands, piercing Kuang Tianqing's body multiple times. Though the sword qi couldn't breach her Bionic armor, it visibly slowed her movements.

Kuang Tianqing chuckled. "Bai Zhenzhen, you can't possibly think such weak, useless sword qi could harm me, can you?"

Bai Zhenzhen replied calmly, "This sword qi may not harm you directly, but it can influence your emotions."

The sword qi embedded in the strands was none other than the sword qi of the Seven Emotions Sword Dao.

The Seven Emotions Sword Dao allows one to sever an opponent's emotions with sword qi, temporarily stripping away joy, anger, sorrow, and all other emotional fluctuations.

"Emotions are the wellspring of human desires, the driving force behind our actions, and a crucial factor in controlling our bodies."

"Without emotions, people become numb, sluggish, and... slow! Very slow!"

As she spoke, countless strands of hair in the atmosphere erupted with surging electrical arcs, emanating from Bai Zhenzhen's thunderous Magical Power.

Accelerated by the accumulated electric field, Bai Zhenzhen's flying sword streaked through the air like a bolt of lightning, piercing the atmosphere amidst crackling arcs of electricity, aiming directly for Kuang Tianqing's forehead.

Faced with this thunderous strike, Kuang Tianqing stood motionless, as if her movements had indeed become numb and sluggish due to the suppression of her emotions.

But as the flying sword drew closer, inching toward her forehead, the thoughts in Kuang Tianqing's mind began to race at an even greater speed.

Under the brain's accelerated processing, the speed of everything in the material world seemed to pale in comparison, appearing as if moving in slow motion.

The Hate Heart Art activated!

This mental cultivation technique, forged through hatred, was one Kuang Tianqing had practiced relentlessly since embarking on the Immortal Dao.

As countless vivid memories, each fueling her bone-deep hatred, flashed through her mind, her spirit and brain, previously numbed by emotional suppression, began to seethe once more.

"Hatred endures far longer and serves me far better than any other emotion or thought."

"You may suppress all my other feelings, but hatred alone — my hatred for my countless enemies and rivals — will forever remain in my mind, driving me relentlessly forward."

"Bai Zhenzhen, your provocations before the Ten Greats League began, your resistance during our first team battle... every single detail is recorded in my diary..."

Fueled by intense hatred, Kuang Tianqing's body reacted instinctively. Just as the tip of the flying sword pierced her brow, she activated the Heavenly Demon Void Technique, preparing to transform into an illusionary shadow and retreat.

But at that moment, amidst the lightning-fast calculations in her mind, unfamiliar memories surged to the surface.

"This is..."

"The battle between good and evil..."

"The demonic path flourishes..."

In an instant, as a flood of unfamiliar memories surged into her mind, Kuang Tianqing felt an unprecedented sense of confusion.

"Who is Kuang Tianqing?"

"Why am I here?"

"Why... has the world become like this?"

After the confusion came overwhelming pain.

"Why have I become a woman?"

"Why? Why? Why must I practice dual cultivation?!"

"Why... must I receive remedial lessons from eight Soul Transformation experts?!"

Amidst unbearable heartache and suffocating frustration, a flame ignited within the darkness of her heart. Extreme rage filled Kuang Tianqing's chest, driving her to fury, to madness, to a desire to destroy everything!

With a furious roar, Kuang Tianqing's voice reverberated across the world through countless livestreams and Bionic Eyes.

"This world... has gone insane!!!"

As her mind churned with violent thoughts, and her heart burned with agony and rage, Kuang Tianqing no longer had time to cast daoist arts to defend against Bai Zhenzhen's sword.

With a soft *puchi* sound, the sword light pierced through her body in an instant.
