# Chapter 752: Ultimate Formless Martial Art, Smashing Open the Heavenly Gate

The day of the final interview had arrived.

Sitting cross-legged in the Meditation Chamber, Zhang Yu silently opened his eyes as countless memories and thoughts flowed through his mind.

Years of study, arduous cultivation, and work... Nearly a decade had passed since he first arrived in Kunxu.

For almost ten years, he had toiled day and night without a single moment of rest, never daring to slacken his cultivation. He had barely slept, never allowing himself to relax for even an instant.

"Such hardship!"

Today, on this very day, he had finally reached the gates of the Myriad Laws Sect. If he could just smash through this final interview, he would truly be accepted into the sect, bringing a perfect conclusion to his nearly ten years of study and labor.

At the same time, the Feather Book unfurled before him, displaying the Chain Formation Diagram.

After his recent cultivation, his Formless Martial Art had reached the perfect 10/10 level. The two subsequent effects had emerged, and he had spent the past few days repeatedly testing them.

Superior - Formless Martial Art (8/8): Allows the user to integrate their own martial arts when simulating a cultivation art.

Ultimate - Formless Martial Art (10/10): Allows the user to simultaneously simulate and fuse two cultivation arts.

As his gaze swept over these two effects, Zhang Yu couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

When he first obtained these two effects, Zhang Yu was still somewhat confused about their meaning and unsure of their practical application.

However, after some experimentation, he gradually understood.

"The Superior effect at the second tier allows me to integrate the mechanics of the martial arts I've mastered."

"The Ultimate effect at the third tier allows me to fuse the mechanics of two simulated cultivation arts together."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Could these three effects be the true purpose behind the ten sets of the Formless Martial Art?"

"Simulate, then fuse... Without needing to truly master them, I can preview the combined effects, synergies, and even the final fused outcome of various martial arts."

When he first obtained the initial effect of the Formless Martial Art, Zhang Yu had assumed it was a martial art created by the Edict Pavilion solely for simulating martial arts to facilitate copyright approval.

But now, he had a different idea.

He had a feeling that the Formless Martial Art was a "Tool Martial Art" — a tool designed for testing, experimentation, and finding the optimal combination of martial arts.

The thought sent a shiver down his spine.

"If such an infinitely versatile martial art was created merely as a tool..."

"Then how earth-shattering must the ultimate martial art be that its creator is truly pursuing?"

At that moment, Zhang Yu felt he had gained a more concrete understanding of the sect's unfathomable depth, and a flicker of anticipation for his future cultivation within it ignited.

Carrying this anticipation, Zhang Yu stepped out of his room. His Bionic Eye flickered, revealing a flood of advertisements related to the upcoming Sect Examination Interview.

Interview Live Stream Preview... Cross-Layer Broadcast... Prize-Winning Highlights... Bet on Interview Results... Pay with Yu Bonds...

As his gaze swept across the streams of Spirit Realm information, Zhang Yu saw countless commercial activities born from the Sect Examination Interview.

"This final interview isn't just being broadcast live across Layers 1 to 10; the Righteous Gods have also orchestrated all sorts of hype campaigns and commercial schemes..."

"Traffic, ads, lotteries, gambling... It's like they're hosting the Olympics or the World Cup."

"No, it's even more captivating, more thrilling for the people of Kunxu than the Olympics or the World Cup."

Thinking back to his life from high school to university to the corporate world, and considering the Kunxu cultivators' obsessive pursuit of the Immortal Dao, Zhang Yu understood... The anticipation and attention surrounding the Sect Examination were on a level of fervor that the Olympics or World Cup of his past life couldn't possibly compare to.

"This is a spectacle captivating the entire populace, a grand production whose commercial value likely surpasses any other event across Layers 1 to 10."

"Especially..."

Zhang Yu's gaze swept over a news article detailing the Righteous Gods' response regarding the future normalization of the Sect Examination.

By now, nearly every Kunxu person across Layers 1 to 10 knew the condition for normalizing the lower layers Sect Examination.

If at least five of the shortlisted interview candidates — Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen, Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan, Kuang Tianqing, and True Monarch Starfire — passed the final interview and were formally accepted into the sect, then the Sect Staff Selection Examination would be held annually across Layers 1 to 10.

This news had struck like a thunderclap, echoing from Kunxu's Tenth Layer all the way down to the First, igniting the passions of countless people.

During this time, Zhang Yu and the others had become the focus of immense public attention. Hundreds of thousands, even millions, of comments flooded their various platform accounts daily.

When Zhang Yu opened his message log, countless messages swirled like a blizzard of snowflakes, all vying to leap to the forefront and display their contents.

Zhang Yu knew these were the countless cheers and encouragements from people over the past few days, their desperate cries for him and the others to smash open the sect's gates.

Zhang Yu also understood that by maintaining the persona of the Sect Examination Clone, he had become a different person in the eyes of many of his companions. But even so... many people still sent him messages.

"Ye Xingli: Senior Brother, I know you might not care about us anymore, but I still want to say thank you. You brought us hope."

"Mo Shangjin: True Monarch, the Immortal Path for everyone in the lower layers rests entirely in your hands."

"Wang Yin: You must win! If you win, we all win!"

"Zhao Tianxing: True Monarch! You will definitely lead us into the sect! We all believe in you!"

"Ying Mingchi: No matter how much you've forgotten, we will always remember your contributions to the monsterfolk. Please, True Monarch, shatter the Heavenly Gate and give all the monsters in the world a chance to enter the sect."

Zhang Yu understood the Cultivators' expectations. With the normalization of the Sect Examination, a large number of Cultivators would gain the opportunity to enter the sect each year.

"Even if those from the higher ups reincarnate down here to take the Sect Examination, it would take them at least thirty to forty years to grow up, learn, and cultivate again."

"This thirty-to-forty-year reincarnation gap will be a golden age for those in the lower layers to climb upward, allowing the sect to recruit countless lower layers Cultivators as disciples."

Zhang Yu continued forward, and Deng Bingding appeared before him.

Looking at Zhang Yu, Deng Bingding's heart surged with emotion as she said, "A god from the higher ups has instructed me to tell you... From now on, act without restraint. Hold nothing back. Completely crush your opponents."

"Whatever the consequences, the Heavenly Court will bear all responsibility."

Zhang Yu nodded at Deng Bingding, thinking to himself, "As expected, the Heavenly Court is eager to open the channels between the upper and lower levels. They want more lower layers Cultivators to enter the sects, making it easier for them to interfere in sect affairs in the future."

Lady Fortune commented, "Of course. Power, by its very nature, desires to expand. From the moment the Heavenly Court was born, it was destined that the Great Gods would never cease their ambitions... They want to control the heavens, the earth, humanity, and beasts. There's nothing in this world they don't want to meddle in."

At that moment, Kuang Tianqing was waiting ahead of Zhang Yu. He nodded at him.

In Zhang Yu's mind, the content of his recent secret conversation with Kuang Tianqing resurfaced.

Kuang Tianqing had said calmly, "The higher ups want me to tell you: unleash your full power and put on a spectacular performance. The interview is the perfect stage."

Zhang Yu chuckled at the words. "Full power? Do you even know what my full power looks like?"

Kuang Tianqing replied, "No matter what it looks like, even if you tear down the heavens of all ten layers leading to the sects, even if you rack up another hundred billion in debt, the Reincarnation Group will have your back. Let us see where your limits truly lie."

As Kuang Tianqing's promise echoed in his mind, Zhang Yu thought, "The Reincarnation Group... the Reincarnation Immortal Emperor... For them, the more people who reincarnate, the better."

Lady Fortune added, "When lower layers Cultivators ascend through the examinations and Upper Level Cultivators reincarnate to take the same tests, the constant circulation between the upper and lower levels — some rising, some falling, an endless cycle of reincarnation — is their greatest source of profit."

"Zhang Yu, this interview is the moment everyone has been waiting for. It's the perfect opportunity to showcase your abilities."

"With the Heavenly Court and the Reincarnation Group backing you in such a grand event, you can openly display your potential and talent. Announce your existence to all of Kunxu."

"Do this, and for a long time to come, you won't have to worry about exposing your true gifts."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly, thinking, "Indeed... This time, I can reveal more of my talent. It will also lay the groundwork for my future work after joining a sect."

Stepping out of the Research Association's gates, Zhang Yu saw Bai Zhenzhen, Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan, and True Monarch Starfire already waiting.

At that moment, Bai Zhenzhen, Yu Xinghan, and Le Mulan's Study Qi surged to the heavens. They had clearly activated their Sect Examination Clones, which now controlled their main bodies.

This was something Zhang Yu and the others had agreed upon beforehand.

After all, the upcoming interview would undoubtedly involve various questions that required answering from the perspective of a sect's ideology. In this state, Bai Zhenzhen, Yu Xinghan, and Le Mulan had the best chance of passing.

Zhang Yu, however, possessed the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture, allowing him to access relevant memories without needing a Sect Examination Clone.

Since this interview didn't demand the same frantic pace as the preliminary examination, Zhang Yu decided to remain in control of his own body and lead the way.

The group exchanged glances, then boarded the Flying Boat.

With a gust of wind, the vessel shot into the sky, heading toward the interview location.

Watching the Flying Boat recede into the distance, Tu Lishan thought, "Carry all our futures with you."

Nearby, True Monarch Miraculous Hand stood beside True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, both gazing at the departing vessel.

"Why are you so concerned with the interview?" True Monarch Miraculous Hand asked. "Even if it becomes a regular event, we're too old to participate, aren't we?"

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter replied coolly, "At least my disciples and students can. That alone will bring me greater benefits. And it gives my next life a better chance."

"Besides..." Memories of his training in a sect flashed through True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's mind. He spoke with icy resolve, "I want those sect disciples who've always looked down on us, mocked us, and tried to keep us forever beneath their feet to see... that if the channels are opened, people from the lower layers can also join the sects."

"This is the first time we've had a chance to beat them."

The Flying Boat pierced through layer after layer of clouds.

Zhang Yu felt the vessel traverse one realm after another, carrying them from the Kunxu Third Layer to the Fifth, then the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth... and finally, the Tenth Layer

The Kunxu Tenth Layer was the final venue for this interview.

And it was through this opportunity that Zhang Yu caught a glimpse of the Kunxu Seventh to Tenth Layers.

According to his prior understanding, the Kunxu Seventh to Tenth Layers were all the territory of Giant Corporations. These corporations were directly subordinate to the Ten Great Sects, their primary business being downward investment, raw material acquisition, and the establishment of various processing industry chains. Ultimately, they supplied vast quantities of processed materials and products to the sects.

As he traversed these layers of Kunxu, Zhang Yu naturally couldn't see the entirety of each layer. But from what he could observe, there were endless Immortal Dao factories.

It wasn't until he reached the Tenth Layer that he saw scattered classical-style buildings and vegetation. According to True Monarch Starfire, these were imitations of the sect environments created by the inhabitants of the Tenth Layer.

However, after reaching the Tenth Layer, the Flying Boat didn't stop. It continued to pierce the clouds, ascending to the highest point of the layer.

Gazing at a Dao Palace floating amidst the clouds, Zhang Yu and the others knew this was their destination for the interview.

"Everyone, please follow me."

Several Righteous Gods appeared before them, ready to escort each candidate to a different interview location.

Kuang Tianqing was the first to depart.

True Monarch Starfire glanced at the scholarly-looking Yu Xinghan and the others with a complicated expression, sighed, and followed a Righteous God away.

Yu Xinghan roared inwardly, "Finally... finally, I've made it this far!"

He looked down at the Kunxu Tenth Layer beneath his feet and vowed in his heart, "From this day forward, I will forever trample the Kunxu Tenth Layer beneath my feet!"

Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, "Across all ten layers, no one loves the Sect more than I do! If I don't join the Sect, who will?"

Le Mulan's lips curled into a slight smile. "Years of bitter study were all for this day! The time has finally come for me, Le Mulan, to become a Sect Scion. Goodbye, you paupers of the lower layers."

Without a word to Zhang Yu, they too followed the Righteous Gods and departed.

Watching their retreating figures, Zhang Yu's mind conjured the true forms of Bai Zhenzhen, Yu Xinghan, and Le Mulan. He thought to himself, "Today, let's smash open the gates of the Sect together."

After navigating the winding corridors of the Dao Palace, Zhang Yu followed the Righteous God and arrived outside a room.

Seeing True Monarch Martial Village also waiting there, Zhang Yu greeted him, "How are you, True Monarch Martial Village?"

True Monarch Martial Village snorted coldly and shot Zhang Yu a dismissive glance. "No need for greetings. This will likely be the only time we ever meet. We won't have the chance to see each other again."

As they spoke, the grand doors of the room swung open with a boom. Beams of divine light flashed, guiding both of them inside.

Within the vast hall, four figures sat enthroned at the center, scrutinizing them with appraising gazes.

Behind these four figures, the silhouettes of numerous sect disciples materialized. Zhang Yu even spotted Yun Zhiguang among them.

"Are all the sect disciples who came to the lower layers here as spectators for the interviews?"

Zhang Yu tried to observe the four figures at the center of the hall, but no matter how hard he looked, their features remained blurred. He could only discern their identities from the Spirit Realm Projection displayed beside them.
