# Chapter 172: Zhang Yu Works Hard to Earn Money

In the dragon-person's view, powerful families would be gradually swallowed by even more powerful families; this was the future trend on the first layer of Kunxu.

Under increasingly fierce competition, mass-producing and optimizing descendants like Red Pagoda does would inevitably become the future reproduction model for more and more powerful families.

"Continuously combining the advantages within the bloodline to breed descendants who are stronger with each generation."

He had always believed that Red Pagoda had a considerable advantage in this area and could quickly capture the market.

The only pity was that in the past, Red Pagoda Group had been too immersed in the demonic beast and demon-kin markets, lacking a sufficient number of high-quality human seeds.

In particular, the excellent genes of many powerful families were not easily leaked, making it very troublesome for them to obtain.

And looking at the Zhang Yu before him, the dragon-person felt as if he were seeing a future flagship product.

_A first-year genius from Songyang City, with quite a few competition awards. And especially before even starting his second year, his various stats have already reached the level of a third-year._

_As long as we extract the advantageous elements from his bloodline... no, even just directly using his seed to improve bloodlines and breed outstanding descendants should be able to attract the interest of many wealthy people._

_If we can sign an exclusive contract, the profits will be even higher._

These thoughts flashed through the dragon-person's mind like lightning.

He laughed and said, "No need to be so formal. If you're willing, you can call me 'Adopted Father' right now."

Zhang Yu said nothing.

If it had been one or two weeks after his arrival in Kunxu, when he was at his poorest and most powerless, and his understanding of Kunxu was still shallow, he might have already kneeled and called him 'Father.'

But now, especially after learning a lot about Red Pagoda Husbandry, he would not dare to casually call the other party 'Adopted Father.'

Zhang Yu understood that 'Adopted Father' and 'adopted son' were just packaging; the various contracts and agreements that would surely follow were probably all traps.

"Oh? You're not willing?"

"I can offer you excellent terms, you know."

"For example, how about the position of Fertility Director at Red Pagoda Husbandry?"

The dragon-person slowly walked to Zhang Yu's side and said in a tempting tone, "After becoming the Fertility Director, as long as they are company employees, you can freely restrict their personal freedom, strip them of their self-will, and squeeze everything out of them. Don't you want this kind of power?"

Hearing this, Zhang Yu was slightly stunned. "Isn't what you're describing illegal?"

The dragon-person chuckled and snapped his fingers, saying, "Xiong Haohan, work overtime tonight. I want to see the plan for the next fertility advertisement campaign by tomorrow morning."

Xiong Haohan's respectful voice came through the communicator: "Yes, I'll get on it right away."

The dragon-person then looked at Zhang Yu. "Don't you want to give it a try? If you're willing, countless demon-kin could be just like that, obeying your every word."

Zhang Yu frowned. "Aren't they all your sons? If this is how your sons are treated, will an adopted son really be treated any better?"

"Doesn't that just depend on the specific details of the contract? I'm not the type to be bound by blood ties."

"Those who don't sign a contract with me aren't my sons, even if my blood flows in their veins."

"Those who sign a contract can be my sons, even without my bloodline."

"I can give you a contract with terms so superior, you will definitely be satisfied."

"Once you sign it, you will be my adopted son—an adopted son with better treatment and a higher status than a biological son."

"In the future, I might even pass on this director's position to you."

The dragon-person's words were extremely tempting. If he were an ordinary high school student, he would probably find it hard to resist the urge to discuss the contract.

But Zhang Yu, after all, was someone who had experienced all kinds of temptations and encountered all sorts of traps. Facing the Black Dragon director's offer, he did not dare to agree in the slightest.

Zhang Yu waved his hands repeatedly, "Alas, I'd like to sign, but I really can't. You should know that I've already signed with Zhang Pianpian. Due to contractual obligations, I can't become your adopted son."

"Zhang Pianpian?" The dragon-person gave Zhang Yu a deep look, a little surprised.

_This kid... he doesn't show even a hint of being moved? Is his head that clear? No... it's not just clear-headedness._

He understood that even many clear-headed people could not help but waver at least a little when faced with a pie falling from the sky.

And the feeling this Zhang Yu gave him was very similar to that of many old-timers who had been badly burned before.

_Just how badly did Zhang Pianpian screw him over? For him to be this vigilant?_

The dragon-person then said with a sympathetic expression, "I can understand that you are bound by a contract."

"It's fine if you don't become my adopted son. How about borrowing your seed then?"

The dragon-person clapped his hands, and immediately, beautiful women of all shapes and sizes, each with a different temperament, appeared from all around. Among them were even many demon-kin like fox demons and cat demons.

"Leave your seed in their bodies. How about I give you one hundred thousand for each one you complete? As long as you have the stamina, I'll pay for as many as you can handle."

Looking at Zhang Yu's heavy breathing, the dragon-person thought to himself, _As expected. A high school student like this is full of vitality. After regaining his fertility, his resistance in this area is even weaker, and with the price I'm offering…_

Zhang Yu shook his head with difficulty, forcing the numbers—one hundred thousand each—out of his mind.

"N-no, thank you. I'll just sell the research rights."

The dragon-person's eyes narrowed slightly. "I've shown you enough sincerity, haven't I? Since you're unwilling to call me 'Adopted Father' and unwilling to accept my invitation."

"Is it because I've been too agreeable?"

A terrifying pressure washed over him, threatening to crush Zhang Yu to his knees.

Zhang Yu could only brace himself and say, "I… I did sign a contract with Zhang Pianpian, after all."

The dragon-person frowned. _The contract Zhang Pianpian signed with him even covers this? Its scope is that broad?_

At this moment, his gaze toward Zhang Yu also carried a hint of pity.

The dragon-person could not help but recall a time over a thousand years ago, when slaves and house servants were still common in the world. Back then, whether a slave could have offspring, how they had them, and how many they had were all managed by the master.

But later, the slave market gradually disappeared, and then the talent market emerged, making it rarer to manage matters like reproduction and descendants.

"I didn't expect Zhang Pianpian to control you so broadly." The dragon-person sighed lightly, patted his shoulder. "You've had it rough."

"What if we switched to men? Would that also be a breach of contract?"

Zhang Yu had just felt a jolt of alarm when he saw the dragon-person's form change before him. The originally androgynous face became even more bewitching, and many female features appeared on his body.

The dragon-person smiled. "Or what if I am neither male nor female, neither dragon nor human? Would that also be a breach?"

"If you don't like this form, give me ten minutes or so for a procedure, and I can change it at any time."

"What do you think?"

Zhang Yu retreated repeatedly, saying with a troubled expression, "I really can't. That would also violate the contract."

The dragon-person gave a faint smile and changed back. "Fine then. Research rights it is."

"Go and sign the contract."

Watching Zhang Yu leave, the dragon-person's gaze suddenly turned cold, his thoughts unreadable. It seemed that the pity and kindness from just a moment ago were merely an illusion.

A fox demon came to the dragon-person's side, wrapped her arm around him, and said softly, "Director, do you value this Zhang Yu's seed so highly?"

"Originally, I just thought his bloodline should be quite good and wanted to keep it as material for the fertility bank. It should have been quite profitable. But if he's truly restricted so tightly by his contract, I've become even more curious about whether there are any secrets in his bloodline."

"I just don't know if the kid is telling the truth or lying. But in any case, it seems this kid isn't some poor wretch who can be tricked by a little temptation."

"Tell the research team to hurry up and study his seed."

"If there really is some mystery, then… we'll figure something out."

Several hours later.

Inside the apartment.

As the apartment door opened, Zhang Yu strode in, full of vigor and pride.

Bai Zhenzhen turned her head and, seeing Zhang Yu's somewhat weakened appearance, asked curiously, "Did it work?"

"How much did you sell it for?"

Zhang Yu smiled proudly. "I was unprepared this time, so the quantity was a bit low. I sold it for one hundred and fifty thousand."

"If they still want more next week, I can sell again."

"That much?" Bai Zhenzhen said with an envious expression. "That's such a great deal, isn't it?"

At this moment, Bai Zhenzhen only hated that she could not earn money as easily as Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu waved his hand magnanimously. "Zhen, don't worry about money. If you're short, you can borrow from me first."

"Dad!" Bai Zhenzhen quickly hugged Zhang Yu and said, "You've worked hard earning money."

Zhang Yu nodded with emotion. "It was quite tiring. It took a lot out of me."

"Is there anything to eat at home?"

Bai Zhenzhen quickly ran to get food. "There's still some leftover dietary supplement demonic beast meat from the last meal. I'll get it for you."

She brought the food over and, while massaging Zhang Yu, encouraged him, "Dad, eat up, get more protein. Try to sell more next time. Our family is depending on you."

Zhang Yu sighed inwardly, knowing this money would not last.

_I still need to raise my potential quickly._

Thinking of this, he quickly contacted Yu Xinghan to arrange a trip to the Dao-Querying Hall in the Spirit Realm.

---

In a quiet room at White Dragon High School.

Yu Xinghan sat cross-legged on the floor, his eyes tightly closed, silently performing a breathing exercise to absorb spiritual energy.

But the mature figure of Li Xuelian kept flashing in his mind, disturbing his thoughts.

"Sigh."

"This can't go on."

"The harm from this root of disaster is too great."

"But if I just remove it, how can I practice the Astral Qi Art? I can't just never cultivate this martial art, can I?"

After pondering for a moment, Yu Xinghan finally contacted True Monarch Starfire, deciding to ask for his master's advice.

"Hello? Master, I have a friend, um… that Zhang Yu, he's encountered a problem…"

More than ten minutes later, Yu Xinghan hung up the phone with a deep frown.

True Monarch Starfire's advice for his 'friend' was simple, just two options.

Either keep the root of disaster, temper his will, overcome the desires in his heart, and continue practicing the Astral Qi Art. This was the path of the strong, but it would inevitably slow his progress for a period of time.

Or remove the root of disaster and temporarily stop practicing the Astral Qi Art. Although this was a form of avoidance, it would not affect his recent progress. But if he had to cultivate the Astral Qi Art eventually in the future, then escaping now might make it even harder to endure later.

Both paths had their pros and cons, and for a moment, Yu Xinghan found it difficult to choose.

Just then, he saw an incoming call from Zhang Yu, and an idea suddenly popped into his head.
