# Chapter 772: No One Understands the Spirit Refining Art Better Than I Do

Shortly after Zhang Yu's name appeared on the display list, Gu Qingya, the Deputy Minister in charge of artifact refinement, contacted him.

Gu Qingya's projection materialized before Zhang Yu. After a brief greeting, he got straight to the point. "Have you made any mistakes in your work? Encountered any problems? Or... broken any rules?"

When Zhang Yu shook his head, Gu Qingya pressed further. "Think carefully. Could your Lower Realm mindset be limiting you, preventing you from realizing you've done something wrong?"

"I don't play favorites," Gu Qingya continued. "Even though I'm also from the Lower Realm, we Lower Realm Natives often lack polish, especially when we first join the sect. Our knowledge and perspective are limited, and sometimes we make mistakes without even realizing it."

Zhang Yu shook his head again. "Deputy Minister Gu, just tell me what's happened."

Gu Qingya replied, "I heard you were reported during the display period."

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened. The first names that came to mind were Lu Hengzhang and the sect's Conservative Faction.

He frowned and said, "Is the Conservative Faction targeting me?"

Gu Qingya replied, "First, think carefully if you've made any mistakes that someone could use against you. The investigation hasn't started yet, so hurry up and fix them."

After Gu Qingya's projection vanished, Zhang Yu mentally reviewed his recent actions. Although a few possibilities faintly emerged, he still couldn't pinpoint the exact source of the problem.

Not long after, Zhang Yu sensed that the members of Martial Dao Group Three seemed to be whispering about something behind his back.

It wasn't until Ye Xingli forwarded him several sensational articles circulating in the Dharma Realm that Zhang Yu understood what everyone was discussing.

"Are There Loopholes in the Edict Pavilion's Review Process?"

"Tens of Millions in Immortal Coin Investment Wasted by a Single Reviewer's Rejection?"

"Why Did the Immortal Dao Technology He Rejected Resurface in the Celestial Monster Sect?"

Just glancing at the headlines, Zhang Yu felt an overwhelming wave of inflammatory rhetoric.

After reading the content, his frown deepened.

Meanwhile, in a private group chat, the cultivators of Martial Dao Group Three had already exchanged thousands of messages in a rapid-fire discussion.

Chu Wangji: "Rejected the Spirit Refining Art, then sold its Immortal Dao Technology to the monsterfolk of the Celestial Monster Sect?"

Wen Zhiwei: "That Spirit Refining Art... I remember True Monarch Zhang rejected it last month, right?"

Chu Wangji: "But this exposé is too ridiculous. No matter what, you can't sell it to the Celestial Monster Sect."

Wen Zhiwei: "I looked at the Spirit Refining Art. The reason for rejection wasn't very strong."

Another person chimed in: "True Monarch Zhang handled so many reports last month. It's not impossible he made a mistake while busy."

It wasn't just the members of Martial Dao Group Three discussing this among themselves. As the exposé spread, more and more people throughout the Edict Pavilion began talking about it. The rumors on the Dharma Realm grew increasingly outrageous.

"Lower Realm Native Sells Sect's Immortal Dao Technology to Monsterfolk?"

"Edict Pavilion Exposes Black Market Chain! Reviewers Become Primary Channel for Leaking Immortal Dao Technology!"

"The Tragedy of Copyright: When Reviewers Become the Biggest Thieves."

Zhang Yu read through the content, thinking to himself, "Lower Realm native, monsterfolk, cultivation art copyright, backroom deals... These are all sensitive topics. It's impossible for this not to attract attention."

A Lower Realm native gets into the Edict Pavilion, then sells the sect's interests to monsterfolk... Just thinking about it, Zhang Yu knew how much attention this exposé would attract. It would likely become ammunition for countless people to attack Lower Realm natives and the policy of regularizing the Lower Realm Sect Examination.

At the same time, Zhang Yu recalled the details of the Spirit Refining Art.

He had a particularly deep impression of this cultivation art.

First, when he initially browsed through it, Zhang Yu had felt a sense of surprise.

This was because the cultivation art, named Spirit Refining Art, appeared on the Feather Book under a different name: *Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art*.

"The name that appeared on the Feather Book is different?"

This was the first strange point Zhang Yu noticed.

Driven by intense curiosity, Zhang Yu searched the Internal Dharma Realm using the name Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art.

He eventually found a cultivation art with that exact name in the Edict Pavilion's database.

"Could this Spirit Refining Art be a copy of the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art? Otherwise, why would the Feather Book identify it as such?"

With this suspicion in mind, Zhang Yu carefully reviewed the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art from the database. However, he found the two cultivation arts to be completely different, showing no signs of plagiarism.

"Although both cultivation arts use fist techniques to condense Martial Dao Will, the Immortal Dao Technology they employ is vastly different."

Whether he was reading the cultivation art's content or simulating it with the Formless Martial Art, Zhang Yu could sense the uniqueness of the Spirit Refining Art. It should have met all the requirements to pass the review.

But the anomalous name on the Feather Book still left him feeling uneasy.

"Why did the Feather Book identify the Spirit Refining Art as the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art?"

Zhang Yu wondered internally, "Could it be a creative coincidence?"

In the end, Zhang Yu decided to use the Feather Book's specialized mode to advance the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art from the Internal Dharma Realm's database to level 40.

This process allowed him to thoroughly understand both cultivation arts in a way that transcended mere reading or simulation.

As countless cultivation memories flooded his mind, Zhang Yu made his judgment.

"This Spirit Refining Art likely does originate from the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art, just with a different form of expression."

"In fact, if you reverse the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art and then perform some deductions, you can naturally achieve the effects of the Spirit Refining Art."

"At first glance, the two seem unrelated, but in fact, they share the same root."

Therefore, Zhang Yu ultimately rejected the submission, pointing out that the Spirit Refining Art's Immortal Dao Technology overlapped with that of the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art.

During the subsequent review, Zhang Yu rejected the applicant's appeal again. At the time, he hadn't thought it was a big deal.

But now, seeing the turmoil it had caused in the Dharma Realm, he thought, "Is someone fanning the flames, trying to use this incident to attack me?"

Before leaving work, Zhang Yu was summoned to the office of Luo Wuji, the Minister of the Review Department.

Without wasting any time, Luo Wuji continued working and said without looking up, "I've reviewed the Spirit Refining Art. Your judgment was wrong."

After delivering this irrefutable verdict, Luo Wuji continued, "Admit your mistake, apologize, issue a clarification, and quell the public outcry as quickly as possible."

For Luo Wuji, who was on the verge of breaking through to the Void Refinement realm and establishing his own Dharma Laws, the most important thing was for Zhang Yu to take full responsibility and silence the controversy as swiftly as possible.

Zhang Yu's gaze hardened. He argued forcefully, "Minister, although the two cultivation arts appear different, their core essence is the same..."

A flash of divine light erupted from Luo Wuji, pressing down on Zhang Yu like a mountain range, silencing him before he could speak further.

Luo Wuji's voice was cold as he said, "Zhang Yu, making a mistake isn't the problem. The problem is you refuse to admit it."

"Last month's performance improved so much; it's normal to make errors when you're busy. I won't blame you for that."

"But now, the public outcry within the sect is disrupting the Review Department's normal operations. Even the Pavilion Master is deeply concerned about this incident..."

While the disruption to work was a concern for Luo Wuji, his primary worry was that the shifting public opinion might affect his establishment of Dharma Laws and his breakthrough to the Void Refinement realm.

Luo Wuji had already taken the time to review both the Spirit Refining Art and the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art, and he was convinced that Zhang Yu had indeed made a mistake.

Therefore, he wanted Zhang Yu to admit his error and apologize as quickly as possible, containing the fallout to a single employee's mistake and preventing the situation from escalating further.

Lifting his head to look at Zhang Yu, Luo Wuji continued his instructions, "The Investigation Team will likely arrive tomorrow. When they question you, just say you were careless and made a wrong judgment."

As Zhang Yu left Luo Wuji's office, Lady Fortune's voice echoed in his mind: "That old fool is so arrogant and self-righteous! He won't even listen to a single word of our explanation."

Immortal Slayer replied, "He's a Soul Transformation cultivator on the verge of breaking through to Void Refinement. Of course he trusts his own judgment over ours."

"And who knows the true origin of that Spirit Refining Art? At first glance, its connection to the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art is far from obvious."

"In his eyes, you were just too eager to complete the task he gave you, and you made a mistake in your haste."

"For him, the priority now is to make you take all the blame, completely absolving himself of responsibility for demanding higher performance."

Lady Fortune sighed, "The achievements of subordinates belong to their superiors, while the mistakes of superiors are borne by their subordinates."

She then asked, "Zhang Yu, what do you think? Are you really going to admit fault?"

Zhang Yu replied, "I'm still in the observation period for my promotion. If I admit fault now... my promotion to Level 2 Sect Staff will be revoked, right?"

Lady Fortune's voice was filled with worry. "What if... what if... I mean, Zhang Yu, are you sure about this?"

She was terrified that Zhang Yu had indeed made the wrong judgment and mistakenly rejected the Spirit Refining Art.

Immortal Slayer, however, had complete confidence in the Feather Book. "Our judgment is definitely correct," he said. "Even if it's ultimately submitted to the Dao Repository, the Dao Repository will certainly reject this Spirit Refining Art."

"But during the investigation, we'll inevitably face some pressure. The necessary procedures can't be avoided."

Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "Pressure... I'm long used to it."

Lady Fortune sighed, "Sigh, can't we just submit it directly to the Dao Repository?"

Immortal Slayer replied, "Saying that shows you don't understand the master-servant relationship between the Edict Pavilion and the Dao Repository."

"The Dao Repository is an extension of the Myriad Laws Immortal Emperor's Dao Lineage. It originates directly from the Immortal Emperor's lineage and authority."

"To the sect, the Edict Pavilion and the Review Department are merely sandboxes for filtering out impurities and junk data. Their ultimate purpose is to preserve the essence for the Dao Repository."

"The Edict Pavilion is a tool for the Dao Repository. One of its primary founding purposes is to serve the Dao Repository."

"It's not the other way around, where the Dao Repository is treated as a tool for the Edict Pavilion."

Immortal Slayer continued eloquently, "That's why the Edict Pavilion has a complete procedure to achieve this goal. Only cultivation arts that meet the requirements earn the right to be submitted to the Dao Repository. Not just anything can be directly uploaded."

"For an investigation like this, the Review Department will likely form a Deliberation Group. Only after they confirm the Spirit Refining Art's novelty, creativity, and practicality will it proceed to the submission stage for the Dao Repository."

"Procedure is omnipresent in the Myriad Laws Sect. It's the foundation that maintains the sect's order. Supporting all of this are the Dao Lineages established by the Immortals, the laws enacted by numerous Upper Cultivators under the coverage of those lineages, the rules established based on those laws, and the procedures formed according to those rules."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly, sighing in admiration. "Dao Lineage... Laws... Rules... Procedures. It's all of this that forms the foundation of the sect, constitutes the operational principles of each mountain peak, and determines the lifestyle and work methods of every cultivator."

Listening to Zhang Yu and Immortal Slayer speak back and forth with such confidence and eloquence, Lady Fortune suddenly felt a surge of alarm.

"This is bad. Before, I was always Zhang Yu's life mentor, teaching him how to navigate the world and climb the ladder in Kunxu."

"But ever since we came to the sect, this Immortal Slayer has been talking more and more, and Zhang Yu is listening to him more and more."

Moreover, Lady Fortune had a nagging feeling that Immortal Slayer and Zhang Yu shared some secret, always speaking in code she couldn't understand.

Of course, Lady Fortune didn't know that the secret was Zhang Yu's Feather Book.

But she did know that both of them possessed Zhang Yu's memories, so it was perfectly normal for them to have secrets only they knew—something she could never compete with.

"No, I can't let this continue."

"If this goes on, won't my ranking in Zhang Yu's heart drop again? My influence within our future 'startup team' will decline too."

"Rise up, Fortune God! Get your brain working! I need to find a way to regain my influence over Zhang Yu!"

While Lady Fortune's mind raced frantically, Zhang Yu had already thrown himself back into his work.

Just as Luo Wuji had predicted, the Investigation Team arrived at Martial Dao Group Three's office the very next day, announcing that Zhang Yu's promotion process had been frozen and suspended.

As the group members watched Zhang Yu follow the Investigation Team to a nearby Meditation Chamber for questioning, their small group chat immediately exploded.

"Is Zhang Yu really in trouble?"

"He's not going to be transferred away, is he?"

"A Level 1 Sect Staff... If he really sold Immortal Dao technology, he'll probably be kicked out of the sect."

"Then what about our performance?!"

The thought of the performance boost Zhang Yu had brought to Martial Dao Group Three, coupled with this month's new targets, sent a wave of despair through the group members.

Chu Wangji recalled the gift he had sent earlier and thought grimly, "What a waste, what a waste. I shouldn't have sent it if I'd known."

Qu Yizhi watched Zhang Yu's retreating figure and thought, "Is this... Lu Hengzhang's doing? If so... Zhang Yu probably won't get out of this easily. As the Group Leader, I'll inevitably be implicated."

Qu Yizhi prided himself on his keen political sensitivity within the sect. He sensed that if Lu Hengzhang and the powerful figure behind him were truly involved, this matter was far from simple.

"Or even... perhaps Zhang Yu is just a pawn?"

Meanwhile, in the Meditation Chamber, Zhang Yu sat cross-legged and calmly answered the Investigation Team's questions.

"Zhang Yu, why did you connect the Spirit Refining Art with the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art?"

"Why did you believe their Immortal Dao technologies overlapped?"

"What evidence do you have?"

Zhang Yu was unwilling to reveal that he had secretly pushed the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art to Level 40. It involved the Feather Book and copyright issues, and he knew they wouldn't believe him anyway.

Although he tried to explain his understanding, it was nearly impossible for anyone who hadn't pushed the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art to Level 40 and condensed the corresponding Fist Intent to grasp his point.

So, Zhang Yu said, "If you want to investigate, you can find someone who has cultivated the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art to Level 40. They can verify my claims."

The investigators exchanged glances. One of them looked at Zhang Yu and said, "Are you aware that the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art has been obsolete for a long time? There is no one left in the Myriad Laws Sect who has cultivated it to Level 40."

Zhang Yu was slightly stunned, a flicker of surprise crossing his eyes.

Meanwhile, the investigator continued, "Why would you think someone who has pushed the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art to Level 40 could prove your point?"

"Could it be that you've encountered a cultivator who has reached Level 40 in the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art? Someone from another sect?"

Zhang Yu frowned. "No. I simply deduced this based on my own understanding of the cultivation art."

As the interview ended and Zhang Yu watched the investigators leave, he could tell they remained completely unconvinced.

At the same time, a strange question arose in his mind: "There's no one in the Myriad Laws Sect who cultivates the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art?"

"If the Spirit Refining Art was plagiarized, does that mean it was copied from an obsolete cultivation art?"

Over the next two days, the members of Martial Dao Group Three were also summoned one by one by the Investigation Team for questioning to further understand Zhang Yu's work.

For a time, the entire group was gripped by anxiety.

Soon, the Deliberation Group, formed by personnel drawn from the Edict Pavilion, began its review of the Spirit Refining Art.

Xiao Zhi, the Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One and a senior reviewer, also joined the Deliberation Group.

Gang Qi radiated from his entire body as waves of Fist Intent surged forth.

After a round of simulated execution, he sighed, "The Spirit Refining Art and the Obsession-Breaking Spirit-Forging Art are completely antithetical. Zhang Yu's reasoning is utterly baffling."

"This is so obvious, there's hardly anything to review."

Another member of the Deliberation Group commented, "Zhang Yu completed so much work last month. He probably made a mistake in his haste."

Xiao Zhi sneered. "I've said it before. The Martial Dao Groups have operated smoothly for years. Someone like him, who blindly rushes to boost his performance right after joining the department, was bound to cause trouble. Wasn't I right about him?"

"Young people are just too naive."

"What's the use of approving so many arts if they're all approved incorrectly?"

"Who knows how many other cultivation arts he overlooked last month besides the Spirit Refining Art?"

"Lower Realm Natives are always so shortsighted."

"Every single one of these cultivation arts was developed at great expense, consuming vast amounts of Immortal Coins and sect resources. To quickly meet his own performance targets, he rejects perfectly good arts like this. How many more sect resources will be wasted because of him?"

Another cultivator said, "Group Leader Xiao, let's not escalate this..."

"Escalate?" Xiao Zhi retorted. "How am I escalating things? I'm worried that sect resources are being needlessly wasted because of people like him."

"I propose expanding the scope of the review to re-examine every single cultivation art Zhang Yu rejected last month."

A member of the Investigation Team immediately interjected, "Group Leader Xiao, choose your words carefully."

Xiao Zhi curled his lip but said nothing more.

Of course, he knew a full re-examination was impossible. If the investigation expanded to cover the entire Martial Dao Group, who knew what might be uncovered?

Xiao Zhi's goal was simply to brand Zhang Yu as someone who recklessly rejected cultivation arts, preventing him from pulling any more stunts to boost his performance.

Xiao Zhi also believed that the higher-ups would be pleased to see the incident contained and defined as Zhang Yu's personal error.

Soon, thanks to Xiao Zhi's active spreading of the story, similar rumors began to circulate within the Edict Pavilion.

"The reason Zhang Yu's performance improved so quickly is that he's been recklessly rejecting arts."

"I heard he rejected all the difficult cultivation arts and only kept the easy ones to review."

Upon hearing this, a flash of understanding crossed Shen Qingyun's eyes. "So that's how it is? That guy... he surpassed me using tricks like this?"

In the office of Gu Qingya, Deputy Minister of the Review Department.

Looking at Zhang Yu, whom he had summoned, Gu Qingya smiled faintly. "One wrong move, and the whole game is lost. It doesn't feel good, does it? I'm not mocking you. I've made mistakes too, and I've been ruthlessly suppressed by others who seized the opportunity."

"That's how it is in the sect. Eyes are everywhere, watching. The slightest mistake, and someone will grab the chance to stomp you into the ground. It's even worse for us Lower Realm Natives..."

"There's nothing to be done. In the sect... far too many people want to climb higher, but there are only so many positions."

Gu Qingya sighed. "It's not unheard of for candidates to assassinate each other over a promotion."

"As someone from the First Layer, you're up for promotion after only three months. Of course, some people can't stand it."

Zhang Yu said calmly, "Deputy Minister Gu, why did you summon me?"

"The laboratory developing the Spirit Refining Art has released numerous videos, escalating the situation even further," Gu Qingya said. "Minister Luo is furious now that he knows you refuse to admit your mistake."

"I'm afraid that after this promotion fails, you won't be able to get promoted again for a very long time."

Zhang Yu asked, "What if I'm right?"

Gu Qingya laughed. "See? This is where you're foolish. Do you really think Minister Luo cares whether you're right or wrong?"

"He's about to establish a new law. What's important to him is quelling public opinion as quickly as possible."

"Only by listening to him and admitting your mistake immediately will you satisfy him."

"Obedience and submission, that's what he demands of you."

"Conversely, even if you are right and have been wronged, if you disobey and refuse to submit, he'll see you as unworthy of promotion."

"Besides, do you really think you know better than Luo Wuji, Xiao Zhi, the Review Department, and a laboratory that has invested tens of millions of Immortal Coins?"

Gu Qingya stared into Zhang Yu's eyes and said calmly, "Who would believe you?"
