# Chapter 710: Dual Masters' Transmission of Power

"Master..."

Looking at Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood before him, Zhang Yu found himself at a loss for words.

Magnetic Pole turned to Greenwood and said, "Old Gao, I need to speak with Zhang Yu alone for a few moments."

Greenwood nodded, and in a flash of light and shadow, he vanished from their sight.

Magnetic Pole then turned to Zhang Yu and sighed, "Zhang Yu, to be honest, when you first came to seek me as your master, I never imagined I would accept someone like you as my disciple."

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback, recalling Magnetic Pole's aloof attitude during their first conversation.

Magnetic Pole continued, "Back then, I saw you as nothing more than a cunning opportunist, trying to latch onto the Artifact Refinement Department through the Civil Engineering Department."

"I've seen countless people like you over the years. After all, this world is like that — as long as you can climb the path of the Immortal Dao, nothing is too sacred to abandon. Morality and beliefs have long been twisted into grotesque parodies of their former selves."

"After all, in Kunxu, money is everything, and the Immortal Dao is the foundation of one's existence. No matter how bloody, vile, or dirty the process of earning wealth may be, the ultimate reward is the respect, adoration, and admiration of all."

"Whether it's the sect members above, the former principals of the academies, or even Soul Transformation cultivators like myself, we're all the same — a group of people who will stop at nothing to accumulate wealth and expand their assets."

"Perhaps the reason I found you so annoying back then was because I saw a reflection of my former self?"

Seeing Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sigh before him, Zhang Yu said, "Master, you never truly enjoyed this way of doing things, did you?"

"You're different from the former principals. You trust Teacher Greenwood and me, fight alongside us, and never betrayed us for Spirit Coins. You also never hoarded my technological breakthroughs for yourself..."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled wryly. "That's my failure. I wanted to reach the pinnacle of the Immortal Dao, abandoning my dignity, morality, and former beliefs. Yet, in the end, I couldn't completely cast everything aside."

"Even with my exceptional innate talent and the opportunities I once had to climb higher, I ultimately failed to remain within the sect."

"Even if I had poured all my heart and soul into it, without the Great Upheaval, I would never have become the principal of Myriad Laws."

As she spoke, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole raised her head, gazing at the Fourth and Fifth Layers of Kunxu in the sky. "Perhaps I simply lacked a true heart devoted to the Dao."

Zhang Yu watched her retreating figure and said, "Only the strong can follow their inner convictions. If it were possible, who in this world wouldn't want to realize their deepest desires? Who would willingly abandon their choices?"

"Master... the choices you've made today are precisely because of your strength — not just physical power, but the strength of your heart and character."

"Perhaps that's why you can trust Teacher Gao and me, and why we can trust you in return."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled, turning back to Zhang Yu. "I had resolved never to take on a disciple like you again in Kunxu. My sole focus was to climb the Immortal Dao, reaching the pinnacle of what I could achieve in this lifetime."

"But fate is a curious thing, forever manipulating us in unexpected ways."

"It led me, in this most impersonal place, Kunxu, to feel the bonds of master and disciple once more."

"Yet you're right, Zhang Yu. This is ultimately my own choice. My strength brought me to this position, and it also led me to make this decision..."

With that, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole extended a finger and gently pressed it against Zhang Yu's forehead.

In the next instant, a flood of data surged into Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye — Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole was transmitting vast amounts of information.

Bank accounts, magical artifact permissions, artifact spirit contact details... countless records of their communications, meetings, and exchanges on Spatial Technology, along with Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's own credentials.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "This battle may sever our connection, cut off communication, and prevent me from attending to matters at Myriad Laws."

"Therefore, I'm entrusting you with the temporary management of my assets at Myriad Laws."

"And here's the evidence I've prepared for you. With these, you can prove that you were the creator of the Spatial Technology showcased at the past press conference."

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened. "Master, aren't you taking these to the Final Battle?"

After swiftly transmitting all the information, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole lightly flicked Zhang Yu's forehead with a fingertip, smiling. "Everything I need for the battle is already prepared. These are just scraps for you. You don't need to worry about me."

With that, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole summoned Divine Monarch Greenwood. "You wanted to speak with him too, didn't you? You two chat. I'll be going now."

As Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole vanished, Divine Monarch Greenwood turned to Zhang Yu, sighing. "Before we knew it, you're already a second-year graduate student."

"Who could have imagined that the unremarkable young man from the construction site would become the strongest undergraduate, now a key figure driving the advancement of Spatial Technology?"

As he spoke, Divine Monarch Greenwood glanced toward the construction site in the distance before continuing, "Over the years, I've worked tirelessly in the Civil Engineering Department, day in and day out, watching generations of teachers and students pour their blood, sweat, and tears into raising the University City layer by layer, sacrificing their entire lives for its advancement."

"I've witnessed the Civil Engineering Department, which laid the solid foundation for the entire university, sink to the bottom, becoming mere sustenance for the Finance Department and little brothers for the Artifact Refinement Department... But that's just the way things are in Kunxu, and I have no choice but to go with the flow."

"Because I'm too weak. Someone as weak as me can only follow the currents of Kunxu."

Zhang Yu replied, "Teacher, I... I don't think you're weak."

He looked earnestly at Divine Monarch Greenwood before him and said, "If it weren't for your guidance and trust, I wouldn't be where I am today. I wouldn't have been able to make such a significant impact on the current war situation or the Ten Great Universities."

"Teacher, it was you who influenced me, and only then could I influence the Ten Great Universities."

"In Myriad Laws, within the Civil Engineering Department, you always maintained a sliver of trust in your students — trust in me and Teacher Magnetic Pole... Teacher Gao, I've always thought you were strong. I've always admired you deeply."

Looking at Divine Monarch Greenwood before him, Zhang Yu recalled his journey in the Immortal Dao, remembering the Feather Book, the Chain Formation Diagram, the Dao Seed Register... Without these, could he have ascended to his current position? Would he have had the strength to preserve his ideals?

Zhang Yu lacked any such confidence.

Therefore, gazing at Divine Monarch Greenwood, Zhang Yu felt no sense of superiority. Even if it was only a fraction of his potential... the Divine Monarch had already achieved what countless cultivators in Kunxu could not.

Sensing Zhang Yu's earnest gaze, Divine Monarch Greenwood chuckled softly. "Do you think I'm strong? Even after advancing to the Soul Transformation stage, many still don't see it that way..."

Zhang Yu replied, "Because they know you would never abuse your power. They know that even with wealth and strength, you would never resort to bloody or underhanded tactics against others."

"In Kunxu, such principles aren't respected; they're mocked and scorned."

Countless memories flashed through Divine Monarch Greenwood's eyes. He shook his head. "Zhang Yu, you truly are different. It's hard to believe a student your age could speak with such conviction."

"If you had said these things at another school, to another teacher, you would have been dismissed as an idiot, someone lacking Immortal Dao Potential, wouldn't you?"

"But I like what you've said, even though I know it's considered wrong in today's world. I still like it."

"Perhaps that's why I can trust you, and you can trust me?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood patted Zhang Yu's head. In the next moment, a surge of "power" began flowing from Divine Monarch Greenwood's body into Zhang Yu's.

It was like the ancient practice of transferring cultivation through a touch, but instead of cultivation, Divine Monarch Greenwood was transferring various documents:

Share transfer agreements, shareholder voting rights transfers... In Kunxu today, these documents represented a true form of "power," now pouring ceaselessly into Zhang Yu's body.

Especially since these shares were all related to companies affiliated with the Great Void Cloud Repository, they represented the most formidable force among the Ten Universities.

"Teacher!" Zhang Yu exclaimed, astonished by the scene before him. "Why are you giving all of this to me?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood chuckled. "Zhang Yu, you should understand that this battle with the Righteous Qi Alliance is a fight to the death for both sides.

"During this conflict, Magnetic Pole and I won't be able to constantly monitor Myriad Laws, oversee the Research Association's affairs, or manage the Great Void Cloud Repository's operations.

"But you can. Moreover, all of this rightfully belongs to you. I'm merely returning what's yours."

Divine Monarch Greenwood cut off Zhang Yu's attempt to speak, continuing: "Zhang Yu, beyond the Soul Transformation cultivators' individual strength and resolve, the most crucial factor in this final battle will be our mastery and application of spatial technology.

"And you are the key to all of this.

"By staying behind, taking control of the Great Void Cloud Repository, and continuing to advance spatial technology, producing more related magical artifacts, you'll be providing us with the greatest support."

Zhang Yu knew the other party was right. Interfering in the battle through Immortal Dao Technology, influencing the clash between Soul Transformation cultivators, was precisely what he should be doing now.

He nodded. "I understand, Teacher."

Divine Monarch Greenwood said, "Zhang Yu, I have great faith in you. In the future, you will become a figure even I will look up to."

"So, while we're away, promise me... you will cultivate diligently and do everything you can to improve yourself."

Zhang Yu nodded deeply, his voice earnest. "Teacher, I will push myself to the limit to improve. I will help you in this battle."

Divine Monarch Greenwood smiled faintly, then recalled Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole reached out, grasped Zhang Yu's hand, and pulled him to the edge of the Grand Void. With a hearty laugh, she soared into the sky, calling out, "Let's go, Zhang Yu. See us off!"
