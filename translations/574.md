# Chapter 574: New Extreme Emotion Sword Dao

Seeing Director Gao's inquiry, Zhang Yu immediately recalled True Monarch Magnetic Pole's earlier instructions.

After a moment's hesitation, he decided not to reply to Director Gao as instructed. Instead, he asked True Monarch Magnetic Pole again.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Old Gao is asking you?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: I see. Leave him to me. You don't need to worry about it.

In the laboratory, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's avatar continued to monitor the equipment and record experimental data while pulling up Director Gao's profile to reply.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Old Gao, you don't need to concern yourself with Zhang Yu and me.

At the construction site, Director Gao, who was conducting an inspection, stopped in his tracks.

Tu Lishan, standing beside him, was taken aback by Director Gao's grave expression. "Teacher?" he asked hesitantly, glancing around. "Is something wrong?"

The construction site leaders accompanying Director Gao exchanged uneasy glances. As his expression grew increasingly solemn, they too began to feel apprehensive.

Meanwhile, on Director Gao's communication interface, he replied: He's also my disciple. How can I not concern myself?

Director Gao: Did you really use him for experiments and infuse him with your experience?

Director Gao: He's just a senior student. Can he withstand such an infusion of experience? Why rush things?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Rest assured, I understand Zhang Yu's constitution better than you do.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: He's incredibly resilient.

Director Gao: Magnetic Pole, the turmoil you've stirred up is far too great.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Old Gao, this was Zhang Yu's and my own choice.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Did you know? In my laboratory, he's even more resilient, more enduring, and happier than he ever was on your construction site.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Want to see photos of him during artifact refinement?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: [Photo]

On the construction site, safety officers, quality inspectors, construction supervisors, production managers, project managers... one by one, they watched Director Gao's expression grow increasingly stern, sensing the air around them grow heavy.

In the next moment, Director Gao said coldly, "Why is this place such a mess? Clean it up immediately."

"And what's with those construction materials? Have they been inspected according to regulations?"

"Where's the project manager? Why is this Magic Power Circuit exposed? I've been drilling safety protocols into you all daily — has it all been for nothing?"

In the laboratory, Bei Wufeng heard the news of Zhang Yu winning first place in the Design Competition.

This reminded Bei Wufeng of their earlier agreement.

While he had initially dismissed Zhang Yu's chances of competing for a spot on the school team, this victory in the Magic Artifact Design Competition made him reconsider his assessment.

"But winning first place in the Design Competition as a senior student..." Bei Wufeng mused. "Could it be that the competitors this year were simply lacking in skill?"

"Or is Zhang Yu's talent truly extraordinary? To stand out so prominently as a senior, surpassing all the Heavenly Chosen from hundreds of schools?"

Intrigued and curious, Bei Wufeng began leveraging his connections to gather information and even sought to examine Zhang Yu's award-winning design blueprints.

When he finally obtained the blueprints for Zhang Yu's winning design, Bei Wufeng studied the "Wind God Semi-Bionic Work Boots" with growing astonishment.

"This... this must be the work of Director Magnetic Pole."

"There's no way a senior student could have designed something like this."

As an artifact refinement student at Myriad Laws University, Bei Wufeng had studied many of his teachers' design blueprints, with True Monarch Magnetic Pole's work being a particular focus of his studies.

As he examined the design's style, Bei Wufeng grew increasingly convinced that Zhang Yu couldn't have created it himself.

Later, when he heard the news about the Soul Transformation Bionic, his suspicions were confirmed.

"So True Monarch Magnetic Pole imparted her experience in magical artifact design to this Zhang Yu."

A flicker of envy and jealousy crossed Bei Wufeng's mind. "This is True Monarch Magnetic Pole's achievement, not Zhang Yu's own."

"Design experience is still just design experience. If he wants to compete with me for a spot on the school team, he has a long way to go."

Just then, a message arrived from his assistant.

Liu Xiangqiao: Boss, I'd like to take a half-day off.

Bei Wufeng pondered the matter. Although Liu Xiangqiao's work wasn't particularly important, her request for leave still irritated him.

This was a crucial time for preparing for the next Ten Greats League. As his laboratory assistant, how could she possibly ask for leave at such a critical moment?

Bei Wufeng: I'll give you a maximum of two hours.

Bei Wufeng: And since your absence will delay the project's progress, I'll deduct three days' wages.

After leaving Bei Wufeng's laboratory, Liu Xiangqiao hurried to Zhang Yu's side.

Although she had previously rejected Zhang Yu's invitation, circumstances had changed. Now that Zhang Yu had won first place in the Design Competition, Liu Xiangqiao saw significant value in joining his team.

After all, in Bei Wufeng's project, she was merely an insignificant assistant. But in Zhang Yu's project, she could become a management assistant.

Especially after hearing that Zhang Yu had acquired the design experience of True Monarch Magnetic Pole, Liu Xiangqiao's desire to work under Zhang Yu grew even stronger.

In Ye Xingli's laboratory, Zhang Yu looked at Liu Xiangqiao and asked, "You're willing to take a pay cut to join my team?"

Seeing Liu Xiangqiao, who had previously rejected his repeated invitations, now adopting such a humble attitude, Zhang Yu pressed further, "And you're willing to work overtime around the clock?"

"For how long?" Liu Xiangqiao asked.

"Until the Ten Greats League," Zhang Yu replied. "You might not have any time for classes except for exams. You'll need to stay in the lab."

Hearing this, Liu Xiangqiao couldn't help but ask, "Are you really planning to participate in the Ten Greats League?"

Zhang Yu smiled faintly, offering no further explanation.

Had she heard this before, Liu Xiangqiao would have dismissed it as mere boasting.

But now, seeing Zhang Yu ranked 19th overall, having won first place in the Design Competition, and hearing the rumors surrounding his Soul Transformation Bionic, she found herself believing him more.

Noticing her lack of objection, Zhang Yu continued, "Senior Sister Liu, it's not that I don't trust you, but I need to test your technical skills before you join."

Moments later, Liu Xiangqiao stood before the experimental workbench, skillfully operating the various lab equipment.

Zhang Yu paid particular attention to her expertise with technologies related to the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation.

"How does this place compare to Bei Wufeng's lab?" Zhang Yu asked.

"It's larger than Bei Wufeng's," Liu Xiangqiao said.

After a pause, she added, "Mainly because there are fewer personnel here, so each person has more operational space."

Zhang Yu asked, "Is it more comfortable here than at Bei Wufeng's?"

"Don't hold back," Zhang Yu assured her. "I brought you here to improve the laboratory's efficiency. If you have any suggestions, please share them."

Liu Xiangqiao immediately offered several recommendations for laboratory management, aimed at enhancing the efficiency and quality of the entire project workflow.

Zhang Yu listened with satisfaction and promptly asked, "When can you start?"

Liu Xiangqiao considered for a moment. "I need a few days to wrap things up at Bei Wufeng's. Since you two are rivals, it's best not to tell him I'm moving here. Otherwise, he might refuse to let me go and create unnecessary complications."

Zhang Yu nodded in agreement. "You've thought this through very carefully."

Just then, a message from Bei Wufeng appeared in Liu Xiangqiao's vision.

Bei Wufeng: Where are you? Why aren't you back yet?

Liu Xiangqiao: I'm on my way.

Liu Xiangqiao: I'll be back soon.

Bei Wufeng: Turn on your location tracking.

Bei Wufeng: Your time's up. I need to check your location.

Bei Wufeng: I said two hours, and I meant two hours. Every second over will result in a deduction from your pay.

Liu Xiangqiao quickly bid farewell to Zhang Yu and rushed out of the laboratory.

Heavenly Sword University.

Waves of seven-colored radiance shimmered through the air, carrying the voice of Divine Monarch Seven Emotions.

"Have you seen the news about Myriad Laws University?"

Bai Zhenzhen's eyes were filled with news articles about the Magic Artifact Design Competition, reports on the breakthroughs achieved with Soul Transformation Bionics, and stories about True Monarch Magnetic Pole using Soul Transformation Bionics to transmit her magical artifact design expertise.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions continued, "Zhang Yu is venturing further and further down the path of researching Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Bionic."

What surprised Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, however, was that Bai Zhenzhen, despite the occasional flash of sword qi around her, seemed far more stable than she had anticipated.

Bai Zhenzhen replied, "It's all for the sake of Immortal Dao research. This is perfectly normal."

At the same time, Bai Zhenzhen's Bionic Eye displayed her chat logs with various individuals, showing her inquiries on the matter.

Lian Tianji of Joyful Union University: "Cultivating with your Master is perfectly normal."

Lian Tianji: "Dual cultivation is a legitimate and standard practice, recognized as a legal industry by the Heavenly Court."

Lian Tianji: "It's only natural for a Master to guide their students — it's their rightful duty."

Lian Tianji: "If two normal things happen together, does that suddenly make it abnormal? Of course not! It's just double the normalcy, even more reasonable and justified."

Lian Tianji: You're talking about feelings? Just because you fix something, you develop feelings? And for your own master? That would be against human ethics, wouldn't it? Normally, such a thing wouldn't happen.

Wen Wuya: You're talking about your master?

Wen Wuya: Bai Zhenzhen, you're truly a genius.

Wen Wuya: It's like the darkest place is right under the lamp!

Wen Wuya: You've given me a tremendous Spirit Inspiration! [Heart]

Leng Wuyai: You've reminded me.

Leng Wuyai: I didn't lose to Zhang Yu.

Leng Wuyai: It was my master who lost to Zhang Yu's master.

The Divine Monarch Seven Emotions watched Bai Zhenzhen's furrowed brow as she pondered deeply. "What are you thinking about?" she asked.

Bai Zhenzhen replied, "The Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is considered a Demonic Path precisely because it violates human ethics, contradicts the Righteous Path of Kunxu, and clashes with the moral principles held by the people of the world."

"To achieve a breakthrough, we must align with the will of the people and the will of Heaven."

"Teacher, I want to reimagine the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"I want to create something new! A new Extreme Emotion Sword Dao!"

Sensing the Divine Spiritual Root within her, Bai Zhenzhen felt she had the potential to achieve this.

After a moment of silence, the Divine Monarch Seven Emotions asked, "Tell me, what is this 'new Extreme Emotion Sword Dao'?"

After a long pause, a furious shout erupted.

"You vile creature!"
