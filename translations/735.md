# Chapter 735: Defeating Immortal Slayer, Devouring the Evil God

True Monarch Immortal Slayer knew that his "Heaven and Earth Are My Sword" could transform the various powers between heaven and earth, but a fundamental prerequisite was understanding.

If he couldn't even comprehend the power he sought to transform, how could he possibly hope to convert it?

Just moments ago, when True Monarch Immortal Slayer had attempted to convert Bai Zhenzhen's Extreme Emotion Sword Qi, he discovered he couldn't.

He simply couldn't understand this sword qi, which was born from emotion.

"Emotion..."

True Monarch Immortal Slayer had long since ceased to believe in such things, nor did he believe that the Kunxu People were capable of genuine emotion.

In his countless past lives, he had witnessed far too many instances of emotion being shattered by reality, twisted by self-interest, and casually betrayed.

Parents, masters and disciples, brothers, comrades, friends... In Kunxu, all such bonds had long been torn apart and distorted by greed.

Because he no longer held any faith in emotion, True Monarch Immortal Slayer could neither comprehend it nor penetrate the Extreme Emotion Sword Qi derived from it. Thus, he was unable to convert the streams of sword qi Bai Zhenzhen was currently unleashing.

"Bai Zhenzhen..."

True Monarch Immortal Slayer stared at Bai Zhenzhen, his gaze icy as he spoke. "To think you'd come here to die with Zhang Yu. Truly unexpected."

"But when you finally face defeat, face death, when you're ultimately trampled underfoot, how long can your emotions sustain you?"

"The Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is ultimately a Demonic Path. The power converted from emotion is too unstable, too fleeting."

"In Kunxu, only strength is everything."

Bai Zhenzhen's actions had indeed surprised True Monarch Immortal Slayer, but he absolutely refused to believe that such emotion — and the power it converted into — could turn the tide of battle.

As he pondered, True Monarch Immortal Slayer's body drifted backward.

Syringe after syringe was injected into his body, flooding him with vast quantities of medicine to rapidly replenish his lost vital energy, Magic Power, and stamina.

Various healing daoist arts were cast upon him by other Nascent Soul True Monarchs, swiftly mending his wounds.

Meanwhile, Nascent Soul Cultivators, one after another, moved to intercept Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, surrounding them in a deadly encirclement.

Hundreds of Nascent Soul True Monarchs from the Righteous Qi Alliance stood proudly amidst the clouds, their combined assault filling the heavens and earth, blotting out the sun.

With such overwhelming numerical superiority, they no longer bothered with tactical considerations.

True Monarch Severing Clouds, the Heavenly Sword traitor, glared venomously at Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen. Facing the two culprits who had brought him to ruin, his heart seethed with hatred. "With so many Nascent Soul Cultivators, we'll wear you down to death even if it takes all day!"

Confronted by the Righteous Qi Alliance's cataclysmic offensive, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen held hands and exchanged a glance.

"A-Zhen, let's go."

The next moment, Zhang Yu led Bai Zhenzhen forward to meet the onslaught.

He blocked the incoming Thunderfire with a single palm strike, while incandescent Extreme Emotion Sword Qi erupted from his back, soaring into the sky.

As they held hands, their Azure Lotus Sword Embryo Spiritual Roots resonated, seeming to merge into one.

Surging Magic Power and sword qi flowed back and forth between them through their clasped hands, connecting their bodies.

Blazing sword qi continuously erupted from both of them.

The distorted space drew all incoming attacks toward Zhang Yu.

At this moment, Zhang Yu was like a mountain that touched the heavens, and also like a dark black hole orbiting Bai Zhenzhen, eternally shielding her from all sides, absorbing and blocking every attack.

Meanwhile, Bai Zhenzhen was like a longsword that could cleave mountains and part seas, forging ahead relentlessly... clearing all obstacles from Zhang Yu's path.

Watching Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen advance step by step, relentlessly pushing back the battle line, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, who had been observing the battlefield, gradually showed a look of astonishment.

Beside him, True Monarch Miraculous Hand asked, "What should we do? Should we rescue them? Facing an encirclement of so many, they probably won't last long..."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter sighed. "They can't stop Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen."

True Monarch Miraculous Hand paused, stunned. "What do you mean? You think Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen alone, without the cover of the Calamity, can break through the blockade of several hundred Nascent Soul Cultivators? Even if many of these Nascent Souls are trash who never would have earned their titles otherwise, there are still hundreds of them..."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter said calmly, "Zhang Yu's defense continuously adapts to his opponents' attacks. After the recent series of Calamity attacks and his clash with True Monarch Immortal Slayer, his adaptability to various techniques has been stacked to an unprecedented peak."

"And this state is still stacking as the siege continues."

"Combined with his apparent healing and self-regeneration abilities, his technique for absorbing enemy attacks, and his power of Spatial Distortion, he can withstand the siege of several hundred people for a considerable time."

"This is why the Righteous Qi Alliance only sought to trap him earlier, not kill him."

"Trapping without killing... is indeed the most suitable tactic against Zhang Yu."

Gazing at the brilliant flashes of light erupting on the battlefield, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter continued, "But with Bai Zhenzhen added to the mix, the situation has changed — drastically, even."

"Zhang Yu... can no longer be trapped."

"Because Bai Zhenzhen's Extreme Emotion Sword Qi is exceptionally destructive, it can shatter any power designed to trap without killing."

"Especially when combined with the longsword in her hand, it elevates the power of her sword qi to its absolute peak."

"And the nature of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao allows the continuously fighting Zhang Yu to constantly stimulate Bai Zhenzhen's Extreme Emotion Sword Qi."

At this point, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter sighed deeply. Gazing at the incandescent sword qi surging and erupting between the two, he lamented, "Coupled with their unconditional trust, which even allows the Extreme Emotion Sword Qi to be transferred between them, letting them share their respective powers... I fear..."

"Until their Magic Power is exhausted, no one here can stop them."

What True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter didn't know was that Bai Zhenzhen's Azure Lotus Sword Embryo allowed her attacks to grow progressively stronger. Through continuous offense, it adaptively enhanced itself, exhibiting ever-increasing attack intensity against her target and constantly elevating the power of her sword techniques.

This trait, combined with Bai Zhenzhen's surging Extreme Emotion Sword Qi, elevated her destructive power to its absolute peak.

In the sky, hundreds of Nascent Soul True Monarchs surged forward like a tsunami, wave after wave of attacks pressing down with overwhelming force. Yet, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, hand in hand, cleaved through them all, forcibly carving a path forward.

As the fierce battle erupted, increasingly desperate shouts echoed from the Righteous Qi Alliance's battle formations.

"Don't attack Zhang Yu! Target Bai Zhenzhen!"

"Spatial barriers are useless! Don't let him get close..."

"We can't retreat any further!"

"We must stop them!"

"There's something strange about this sword qi! Don't get hit repeatedly!"

"Fall back! Fall back! They're coming!"

Martial arts and daoist arts, honed over years of cultivation, bombarded Zhang Yu's body but inflicted little damage.

Magical artifacts and Bionics, repeatedly upgraded and modified, along with physical bodies and armor tempered through long training, all crumbled under the relentless assault of the Extreme Emotion Sword Qi.

For a moment, magical artifacts rained from the sky like falling stars, and blood cascaded like waterfalls.

Unconsciously, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had arrived before True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

Together, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen roared, "Immortal Slayer! You are defeated!"

True Monarch Immortal Slayer snorted coldly. "Just you two?!"

But as the incandescent sword qi rushed toward him, he retreated.

Facing this Extreme Emotion Sword Qi that couldn't be converted, True Monarch Immortal Slayer could only fall back again and again.

At the same time, he pointed his sword fingers, and sword qi condensed from the heavens and earth, slashing across the distance toward Bai Zhenzhen.

With a series of crackling explosions, Zhang Yu intercepted every one of the sword qi strikes.

Meanwhile, an even more ferocious wave of Extreme Emotion Sword Qi surged forward.

Watching Bai Zhenzhen, who attacked relentlessly without any thought for defense, each strike a desperate gamble, True Monarch Immortal Slayer's eyes filled with confusion, doubt, and disbelief.

"Why?"

He saw no defensive or evasive maneuvers from Bai Zhenzhen. She simply slashed at him, one sword strike after another, in a state of pure offense, as if nothing else in the world mattered.

True Monarch Immortal Slayer understood: Bai Zhenzhen had entrusted her entire safety to Zhang Yu.

"Why does she trust Zhang Yu so completely?"

"What gives you the right to trust him so much?!"

With a furious roar, True Monarch Immortal Slayer unleashed his inner reserves. The sword qi that erupted skyward collided with Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

In the blink of an eye, hundreds of moves had passed. True Monarch Immortal Slayer watched the duo, who grew stronger with every clash, and felt the Extreme Emotion Sword Qi surging with ever-increasing power.

His gaze flickered to the hesitant Nascent Soul cultivators of the Righteous Qi Alliance in the distance...

For some reason, Zhang Yu's earlier words echoed in his mind.

"If they can be changed by Kunxu, they can be changed back..."

"Changing the living is how you truly change Kunxu!"

True Monarch Immortal Slayer gritted his teeth, forcing the distracting thoughts from his mind.

But in the next instant, Zhang Yu violently tore through True Monarch Immortal Slayer's sword qi and charged directly in front of him.

Zhang Yu absorbed a massive amount of sword qi with one hand, then unleashed an even more ferocious surge of Extreme Emotion Sword Qi from his palm.

Throughout their joint battle, Zhang Yu had been tightly holding Bai Zhenzhen's hand, silently accumulating Extreme Emotion Sword Qi using his Immortal Descendant lineage.

Now, he suddenly unleashed this stored power, instantly elevating their offensive to a new level and completely engulfing True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

True Monarch Immortal Slayer felt the incoming sword qi grow sharper and heavier with each strike. It tore through his flesh and blood, gradually shattering his meridians.

*Bang!* *Bang!* *Bang!* *Bang!*

Clouds of blood mist erupted within True Monarch Immortal Slayer's body.

As he felt his movements slowing, an unprecedented thought surged through his mind.

"Am I... going to lose?"

"Lose to Zhang Yu?"

"Lose to an emotion I can no longer believe in, no longer understand?"

"Impossible!"

With a furious roar, True Monarch Immortal Slayer reached out and seized the raging Extreme Emotion Sword Qi before him. He desperately tried to feel its scorching intensity, the connection between emotion and sword qi, the intent Bai Zhenzhen had poured into it...

"I am the one who will create a new world."

"The one who will change the world alongside my Master and Grandmaster!"

But as he watched the sword qi gradually pulverize his hand, a trace of sorrow and disappointment crept into his heart.

"Immortal Slayer," Zhang Yu said slowly, watching the expert being consumed by the Extreme Emotion Sword Qi. "I saw it all."

"Your past... You were once cared for by your parents, guided by your elders, and treated kindly by countless friends."

"Have you forgotten? You weren't born this way. You were changed while you lived..."

As his body gradually disintegrated, True Monarch Immortal Slayer felt himself growing weaker and weaker, his body growing colder and more powerless. Memories of his former self seemed to surface in his mind.

The self who hadn't yet started working, who stumbled when he walked, who needed someone to support him, care for him, feed him...

He remembered the people who had betrayed him, trampled on him, and drained him dry. He also remembered how they had once cared for him, accompanied him, and guided him.

"Changed while I lived?"

With most of his body pulverized by the Extreme Emotion Sword Qi, True Monarch Immortal Slayer knew his life was reaching its final moments.

Gazing at the last wisps of Extreme Emotion Sword Qi he had managed to convert, he sneered, "So I, too... am someone who should have been changed?"

"Zhang Yu, I admit your words have some merit, but..."

True Monarch Immortal Slayer looked at Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen before him and said faintly, "Remember this. You defeated me today only because you are strong enough. It has nothing to do with any bullshit emotions. The strongest decides everything. Because you are strong enough today, you can impose your principles on me. This is fucking Kunxu. Remember that..."

*Bang!*

As the last remnants of his body completely disintegrated, True Monarch Immortal Slayer turned to ash and scattered into the wind.

The experts of the Righteous Qi Alliance who witnessed this scene stood frozen in place. When Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's gazes swept over them, they stumbled back in terror.

Meanwhile, the Ten Universities Nascent Souls who had been repelled earlier had regrouped.

They had been scattered and decimated by True Monarch Immortal Slayer's forces. Aside from the Nascent Soul Cultivators who had fallen in battle, the rest had fled in all directions. They had distanced themselves from the battlefield but hadn't truly escaped, instead observing the situation from afar.

As Zhang Yu appeared and gradually turned the tide of battle, these observing Ten Universities Nascent Souls began to gather, drawing closer and closer to the battlefield.

True Monarch Miraculous Hand watched True Monarch Immortal Slayer's demise with awe. "He actually won... Heavenly Slaughter, you were spot on. All those years of combat experience weren't wasted after all."

Heavenly Slaughter replied, "With the two of them fighting together, they are now invincible on the Nascent Soul Battlefield."

True Monarch Precise Attainment of Heavenly Demon University, who had returned to the battlefield at some point, sighed in admiration. "First, he fought a hundred alone, resisting the Calamity. Then, the two of them joined forces to sweep through the Righteous Qi Alliance's experts."

"I'm convinced. From now on, True Monarch Blazing Light is the strongest Nascent Soul of our Ten Universities."

True Monarch Heavenly Struggle from Netherworld University exclaimed, "Not good! Those Righteous Qi Alliance scoundrels are trying to ambush True Monarch Blazing Light after his grueling battle! We must reinforce him!"

Meanwhile, the atmosphere in the Soul Transformation Battlefield shifted abruptly.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, who had been observing the battle all along, burst into laughter. "Excellent! Excellent!"

"Magnetic Pole! Greenwood! You two have taught a fine disciple! Not only is he brilliant at research and making money, but his combat prowess is also unparalleled. He deserves full credit for turning the tide of this battle!"

Divine Monarch Nether Spring of Netherworld University gazed toward Zhang Yu, his eyes gleaming with admiration as he sighed inwardly, "What a pity this Zhang Yu is neither my son nor my disciple."

Broken Radiance Divine Lord of Heavenly Sword University remarked with emotion, "Without Bai Zhenzhen, whom our university cultivated with all its Soul Transformation resources, arriving at the critical moment, Zhang Yu alone could not have accomplished such a monumental feat."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, finally breathing a sigh of relief, reminded them, "Everyone, the overall situation is not yet decided. We cannot afford to be careless. Immediately order all universities to support Zhang Yu and completely seize the formation core."

Divine Monarch Greenwood added urgently, "The Righteous Qi Alliance's Soul Transformation experts are intensifying their assault! We must hold the line!"

Following the successive orders from the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts and the proactive cooperation of their Nascent Souls, streaks of rainbow light immediately streaked across the sky, descending toward the formation core.

These Ten Universities Nascent Souls had either completed their rest or healed their injuries, and their combat readiness was now largely restored.

With True Monarch Immortal Slayer dead and Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen demonstrating the power to sweep the battlefield, the recapture of the formation core was within reach. This ignited an unprecedentedly fierce fighting spirit in all the Ten Universities Nascent Souls.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Celestial Elephant, True Monarch Desolate Tiger, and others joined the battlefield with soaring morale.

In truth, they had arrived much earlier, but the Calamity-shrouded battlefield had been so terrifying that they hadn't dared to intervene recklessly.

Later, after the Calamity dissipated, Zhang Yu was besieged by hundreds of Nascent Soul True Monarchs — a sight that also deterred them from acting rashly.

The despair of impending defeat had completely enveloped them, making them consider retreating.

But watching Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen sweep through the Righteous Qi Alliance and ultimately defeat True Monarch Immortal Slayer left True Monarch Celestial Elephant and the others increasingly stunned.

"This is going to cost extra," True Monarch Celestial Elephant thought to himself. "The gratitude fee for True Monarch Blazing Light... should I double it? Or triple it?"

In stark contrast to the Ten Universities' surging morale, the Righteous Qi Alliance crumbled into disarray after True Monarch Immortal Slayer's defeat. They retreated steadily under the Ten Universities' assault.

With a soft thud, True Monarch Severing Clouds, his body reduced to its lower half, was pinned to the ground by a volley of longswords.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter sneered, "Traitor, you're just half a body now. Did you really think you could escape?"

True Monarch Severing Clouds gave a bitter smile and said, "If I told you I was only pretending to surrender, looking for a chance to rescue people, would you believe me?"

Stomping a foot on the other's head, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter said coldly, "What do you think?"

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's Demon Beast Clones were freed one by one.

However, the clone that had absorbed True Monarch Immortal Slayer's memories remained tightly suppressed. Ever since True Monarch Immortal Slayer's defeat, this clone had fallen completely silent.

Looking at this Demon Beast Clone, Zhang Yu hesitated, unsure how to handle it.

Shaking his head, Zhang Yu decided to imprison it for now and deal with it later.

He then led Bai Zhenzhen to a secluded spot, where she produced Lady Fortune, who was in her black pearl form.

Seeing the sealed Joy God, Lady Fortune exclaimed excitedly, "Excellent! Zhang Yu, you did a fantastic job!"

Zhang Yu said, "If you consume this, you should be able to level up again, right?"

Lady Fortune urged impatiently, "Of course! Give it to me quickly. When I level up, you'll all benefit."

Without further delay, Zhang Yu placed the black pearl directly onto the sealed Joy God.

The next instant, the black pearl that was Lady Fortune swelled violently, completely swallowing the Joy God before shrinking back to its original size.

Immediately after, Lady Fortune's voice came intermittently: "I need... some time to process..."

Then, Lady Fortune fell completely silent, as if she had fallen into a deep coma.

Zhang Yu recalled that Lady Fortune had also slept for a long time after her last consumption, so he wasn't surprised. He reached out and stored the black pearl away.

Meanwhile, the Ten Universities had completely secured the formation core.

Looking at the fully occupied formation core, Zhang Yu sent a message to his sister: "Sis, can you control the formation core?"

Zhang Pianpian replied, "I'm already working on it. Just hold your position there. It should only take another ten minutes or so."

At the same time, Zhang Yu began discussing the next steps with Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "We originally thought that your battle would, at best, only temporarily occupy the formation core. In that case, we would have had to break the great formation, and the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts would have shifted the battlefield to buy more time until the Heavenly Court arrives."

In Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's and the others' original projections, the entire Second to Fifth Layers would have become a battlefield for the Soul Transformation experts of both sides.

To stall for time until the Heavenly Court's arrival, the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts would have engaged in mobile warfare, causing both the intensity and scope of the battles to escalate dramatically.

In that scenario, even if they managed to delay until the Heavenly Court arrived, the entire Second to Fifth Layers would have suffered unprecedented, catastrophic losses.

The thought of such losses had always filled the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts with deep unease, yet they had felt powerless to prevent it.

But now, with Zhang Yu's frontal victory over True Monarch Immortal Slayer and the utter defeat of the Righteous Qi Alliance's remaining Nascent Soul experts, the entire Nascent Soul Battlefield was firmly under the Ten Universities' control.

This gave Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and the others a new idea.

"We can use this formation core to counter the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation."

As Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole spoke, she looked at Divine Monarch Greenwood and said, "Old Gao, you're the expert on formations. You explain it."

Divine Monarch Greenwood nodded. "This great formation consists of inner and outer layers. To trap us Soul Transformation experts inside, the formation core was placed within the outer formation. This makes it impossible for those inside to break the great formation without using brute force."

"But under the combined assault of Fu Xiantian and the Righteous Qi Alliance's Soul Transformation experts, we lacked the time and energy to brute-force our way through this formation."

"Furthermore, with the firmament that originally separated the Fourth and Fifth Layers, the Ten Universities couldn't send reinforcements here. The entire battle situation was designed to be foolproof, trapping us until we died."

"But now that you've shattered the firmament and we have complete control over the formation core, we can modify the outer great formation to counter the inner Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation. We can turn this formation against Fu Xiantian and the others, trapping them and cutting off their supply lines."

"Then, it will be them trapped by the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation, not us."

"As long as we suppress the Righteous Qi Alliance's Soul Transformation experts one by one within this formation..."

If this battle plan succeeded, not only would the Soul Transformation Battlefield be contained, preventing immeasurable losses, but they could also capture all the Righteous Qi Alliance's Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs in one fell swoop, reaping immense rewards.

Thus, faced with the battle plan proposed by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood, the vast majority of Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs gave their enthusiastic approval.

Since there was an opportunity to reap greater rewards, they were willing to risk fighting a little longer.

Zhang Yu naturally supported this plan as well. After all, if the Soul Transformation Battlefield were to expand, the death toll would be unimaginable. Even he would face immense danger, and the entire battle situation would spiral out of control into utter chaos.

Once the battle plan was agreed upon, Divine Monarch Greenwood produced a formation diagram.

He explained, "This is a new formation diagram I designed after observing the outer great formation during this time."

"As long as we construct it according to this method, we can complete the modification of the outer formation, reverse-control the inner formation, and use the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation to suppress the Righteous Qi Alliance."

Staring at the complex formation diagram, a flicker of doubt arose in Zhang Yu's mind.

"Fu Xiantian... why didn't he set up the formation this way? This arrangement should have ended the battle much faster, right?"
