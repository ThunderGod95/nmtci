# Chapter 733: One Against a Hundred, Battle with Immortal Slayer

Perhaps because victory seemed certain, or perhaps for profit, Qi Luck, and Evil God Power... since the war began, the final battle inside and outside the formation core had been continuously broadcast live by the Righteous Qi Alliance.

As the Righteous Qi Alliance achieved victory after victory in the live broadcast, the morale of its countless cultivators — Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, and Golden Core alike — soared. It seemed they could already envision the once-lofty Ten Universities being trampled beneath their feet.

This atmosphere began to shatter with Zhang Yu's appearance.

Watching Zhang Yu single-handedly breach the Restricted Zone, advance step by step toward the formation core, and defeat several renowned Righteous Qi Alliance experts along the way, the Dark Spirit Realm erupted in an uproar.

When Zhang Yu was just 30 kilometers from True Monarch Immortal Slayer, nearly a hundred Nascent Soul True Monarchs from the Righteous Qi Alliance stood in his path.

Layer upon layer of Spatial Barriers were erected. Magical artifacts soared into the sky. Countless Bionic Eyes and flying swords locked onto Zhang Yu. Wave after wave of Spirit Realm attacks surged toward him like a relentless tide...

Meanwhile, in the Dark Spirit Realm's live broadcast rooms, countless Righteous Qi Alliance cultivators seemed to be roaring in unison.

"Stop him! Don't let him advance any further!"

"If so many of you Nascent Soul cultivators can't stop him, don't bother livestreaming ever again!"

"Crush this Zhang Yu! Utterly defeat the Ten Universities!"

A massive flood of messages surged through the Dark Spirit Realm as more and more eyes converged on this battlefield.

At the same time, True Monarch Severing Clouds, who had betrayed the Ten Universities, remotely controlled over a thousand flying swords, all aimed at Zhang Yu. The killing intent in his eyes seemed to solidify into physical substance.

"Zhang Yu!"

True Monarch Severing Clouds' mind replayed the memory of being sacrificed by Heavenly Sword University after offending Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen. Seeing Zhang Yu again now, his hatred burned with renewed intensity.

Especially on this battlefield where the Righteous Qi Alliance's victory seemed inevitable, Zhang Yu's appearance stirred a torrent of emotions within him.

"Zhang Yu, last time, the momentum was with you. I was powerless, forced to endure your humiliation."

"But this time, the momentum is with me!"

"The Righteous Qi Alliance will undoubtedly win this battle!"

"Kill!"

The next moment, the Calamity enveloping Zhang Yu closed in, and the two opposing forces clashed violently.

*Boom!*

The moment the two forces collided, the sky seemed to tear apart, and the earth churned as if being flipped over.

On one side was the Myriad Laws Nascent Soul, now a Five-Star Criminal, relentlessly besieged by the Calamity triggered by the divine power network.

On the other side were the elites of the Righteous Qi Alliance: certified Nascent Soul Experts who had betrayed the Ten Universities, rogue Nascent Souls determined to resist the Heavenly Court, Dark Spirit Realm influencers who had amassed immense wealth and Qi Luck, and even Believer Nascent Souls backed by Evil Gods.

Their strengths varied, but many among them had cultivated longer than Zhang Yu, possessed more experience, wielded deeper Magic Power, and owned more flying swords, magical artifacts, and Bionics. Some even had Nascent Souls that were more fully evolved than his.

Under such circumstances, could Zhang Yu truly defeat over a hundred opponents single-handedly?

Almost every viewer watching the livestream had the same answer in their minds.

No! Zhang Yu was doomed to fail!

But before the eyes of tens of thousands, Zhang Yu shattered that certainty.

A roaring beast shadow erupted from his body, the ground trembled violently with his every step, and the intensity of the blazing Calamity continued to escalate.

"Collective violent resistance to the law detected! Collective violent resistance to the law detected! Cease immediately..."

As the Calamity descended by the divine power network collided with over a hundred Nascent Soul True Monarchs, blinding crimson warning text flashed violently before Zhang Yu's eyes.

But whether it was warnings or the Calamity itself, Zhang Yu would not stop his advance, no matter the opponent.

Forward! Forward! Forward!

As Zhang Yu pressed on, hundreds, even thousands of wounds appeared on his body. A thick mist of blood mingled with his Gang Qi, making him look like a blazing flame.

At the same time, countless magical artifacts shattered, swarms of flying swords were crushed, and the layers of spatial barriers spanning over ten kilometers were pierced one by one.

In that moment, Zhang Yu's relentless advance revealed the battle's true outcome to everyone.

One against a hundred?

Absolutely possible! Easily possible!

True Monarch Junior College, who had been chasing him, couldn't help but stop, no longer daring to pursue. Staring at the figure completely engulfed by the Calamity, he muttered, "Still escalating... Still escalating..."

True Monarch Severing Clouds, with only half his body remaining, had just managed to roll and crawl out of the Calamity's range. His face pale, he stared at the figure surrounded by layers of Calamity, still trembling uncontrollably.

At this moment, all the live broadcast rooms in the Dark Spirit Realm fell silent. Countless viewers were struck speechless by the scene.

At this moment, Zhang Yu's recent opponents were either dead, wounded, or crippled, having all retreated. No one dared to stand in his way.

At this moment, he was only ten kilometers away from True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

Their gazes seemed to cross the ten-kilometer distance, clashing violently.

True Monarch Immortal Slayer pinned True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter in mid-air with a single sword strike. With his other hand, he held True Monarch String Tone's Nascent Soul, then crushed it with a resounding *boom*.

He stood proudly among the clouds like a king, looking down at Zhang Yu as if commending a subordinate. "You've saved me some trouble," he said lightly. "Well done."

Zhang Yu stared coldly at True Monarch Immortal Slayer. "Let them go. I'll fight you."

True Monarch Immortal Slayer's voice drifted over softly. "Defeating a bunch of trash makes you think you can negotiate with me?"

With a soft *swish*, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's head plummeted toward the ground.

At the same time, streaks of sword light flared, slashing toward the falling head.

*Boom!*

Zhang Yu's figure instantly accelerated. Roaring Beast Howls erupted from within his body, transforming into streaks of frenzied beast shadows that burst forth from behind him, relentlessly propelling him forward! Faster!

In a mere instant, Zhang Yu appeared before True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's falling head, pressing one hand against the incoming sword light.

*Bang!*

As their powers collided, the sword light flared brilliantly. It shrank under the twisting force of Kunlun in the Palm, yet repeatedly struggled to expand.

Zhang Yu stared into True Monarch Immortal Slayer's eyes and said, word by word, "When did you get the idea I was negotiating with you? I was just..."

*Crack!*

Under the operation of Kunlun in the Palm, the sword light's spine seemed to shatter under spatial compression. It twisted into serpentine curves before being absorbed into Zhang Yu's palm.

Zhang Yu continued, "...telling you what's about to happen."

At the same time, True Monarch Miraculous Hand caught True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's falling head. He then dragged the half-dead bodies of several Nascent Soul True Monarchs and led the remaining experts of the Ten Universities in a unified retreat out of the formation core.

It wasn't that they were unwilling to support Zhang Yu, but that with his arrival, the Calamity was also about to descend.

In the sky, streaks of purple lightning suddenly erupted, illuminating the heavens and earth with a blinding flash.

True Monarch Immortal Slayer listened to Zhang Yu's words and said calmly, "Is this why you refused to join us? So you could save all these hopeless fools?"

Zhang Yu glanced at the fading Soul Transformation Divine Light in the sky, then fixed his gaze on True Monarch Immortal Slayer's eyes and said, "Enough talk. Let's fight."

"In Kunxu, the strong decide everything."

"If you can't even defeat me, can't even stop me, then don't bother talking about a New World."

True Monarch Immortal Slayer nodded. "Indeed. If I... can't even kill you, then there's truly no point in discussing a New World."

The instant True Monarch Immortal Slayer's voice faded, his figure abruptly shot forward, a sword finger striking toward the point between Zhang Yu's eyebrows.

BOOM!

At the same time, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky, engulfing both their figures.

Sizzling electricity coursed through and around Zhang Yu's body, leaving only faint scorch marks.

True Monarch Immortal Slayer, who had been just inches away, reappeared a hundred meters distant.

The sky filled with the Calamity's attacks — sandstorm flying swords, tornado water blades, boiling explosive air, and descending thunderlight. Wave after wave of assaults rained down around Zhang Yu, gradually enveloping the entire formation core.

Yet, amidst this dense and terrifying barrage, True Monarch Immortal Slayer's figure weaved back and forth, always dodging the attacks by a hair's breadth. He moved like a phantom across the battlefield, periodically slashing at Zhang Yu with his sword, piercing through gaps in his defense and leaving wounds on his body.

"This guy's sword techniques..."

Zhang Yu sensed that each of True Monarch Immortal Slayer's moves contained not only sword arts but also the profound mysteries of various martial dao, including the saber, spear, and staff.

Each sword strike seemed to contain dozens of intertwining forces. Under the assault of various destructive powers — explosive, cutting, tearing, or disintegrating — even Zhang Yu's powerful physique, long tempered by the Calamity, began to sustain damage.

Hah!

With a furious roar, the earth beneath Zhang Yu's feet abruptly transformed into pairs of massive hands that lunged toward True Monarch Immortal Slayer, only for him to evade them again as if he had foreseen the move.

Zhang Yu thought, "This guy's movement techniques and mental cultivation techniques work in perfect harmony, allowing him to flawlessly predict the battle's flow and execute the most correct and rational responses."

"To him, the battlefield-wide Calamity isn't a threat at all; it's more like a sea of flowers dancing with him..."

"After all, the Calamity's power landing near him isn't aimed at him — it's just the aftershock of the attacks targeting me. He can easily dodge these aftershocks and even use them as cover to launch his own attacks..."

As these thoughts raced through his mind, Zhang Yu sent a message to Zhang Pianpian: "Sis, can you increase the Calamity's power any further?"

Zhang Pianpian replied, "It's not impossible to increase the Calamity's intensity further, or to raise your crime level to 6-star or even 7-star..."

"But at that stage, the divine power network becomes a rampaging force that even I can barely control. Even if it's not as powerful as when a Righteous God is presiding over it, it's still far beyond what you can withstand and will lead to all sorts of uncontrollable consequences."

As she spoke, a giant dragon roared out from the Great Void Cloud Repository at Zhang Yu's waist, its maw gaping to swallow True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

But a flash of blood-red light appeared, and countless sword marks pierced through the dragon.

The dragon, erupting in a mist of blood, retreated back into the Great Void Cloud Repository. Its flesh writhed and regenerated under the effects of activation, and its numerous wounds were frozen over to accelerate healing.

Throughout their journey, Zhang Yu's sixteen Demon Beast avatars had suffered grievous injuries time and again, but thanks to his own incredibly potent regenerative abilities, they always managed to return to the battlefield after recovering most of their wounds.

In an instant, beast roars echoed and the Calamity surged. The Heavenly Sun Radiance God then charged out amidst a sky of fire, and the twelve swords of the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation were deployed one by one.

Yet even with all this, Zhang Yu found he still couldn't gain the upper hand.

Even though True Monarch Immortal Slayer was just one man with one sword, he always struck with perfect timing, dodged every attack, and forcefully suppressed the sky-filling Calamity and Zhang Yu's relentless assaults.

Just then, True Monarch Immortal Slayer spoke: "Have you reached your limit? Can you no longer increase the Calamity's intensity?"

"If this is the extent of your abilities, then this battle... should come to an end."

As he spoke, True Monarch Immortal Slayer spread his arms, and the rampaging, unrestrained forces of the Calamity began to swirl around him.

He said coldly, "Whatever tricks you have left, use them all now."

In the next moment, whether it was floods, sandstorms, shockwaves, wind blades, water blades, heat rays, or lightning bolts raining from the sky, all were transformed into wisps of sword qi around True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

At the same time, a message from Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Zhang Yu, this sword technique is called 'Heaven and Earth Are My Sword.' It should be a newly created Immortal Sect Sword Art from their sect. His master, Fu Xiantian, used it multiple times during our battle..."

Through Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's explanation, Zhang Yu finally understood the formidable nature of this Immortal Sect Sword Art: a cultivation art that could convert the forces of heaven and earth, and even an opponent's attacks, into one's own sword qi.

As Zhang Yu rapidly scanned the information sent by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, True Monarch Immortal Slayer pointed a finger.

The sword qi formed from the Calamity's power descended fiercely. Beyond its inherent sharpness, it fused the destructive might of the various Calamities and blasted toward Zhang Yu.

In that moment, the Calamity Zhang Yu had drawn toward himself seemed to become True Monarch Immortal Slayer's arsenal. The True Monarch appeared to have become the master of the Calamity, condensing its layered forces into sword qi and pushing its power to a new realm as he relentlessly slashed at Zhang Yu.

In an instant, more than ten of Zhang Yu's clones were severely wounded, seemingly on the verge of being torn apart.

Zhang Yu immediately activated Kunlun in the Palm, attempting to draw the sword qi away from a distance.

But in the next moment, he discovered that the sword qi was completely unaffected by Kunlun in the Palm.

"Every strand of sword qi... is encased in a spatial barrier."

Zhang Yu's heart sank. "This guy... besides 'Heaven and Earth Are My Sword,' his cultivation of 'Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier' has also reached the pinnacle of perfection."

The beast shadows were instantly torn apart, and the sword qi reached Zhang Yu in the blink of an eye.

Facing this scene, Zhang Yu remained calm and composed. He brought his hands together, then spread them apart... and a surging torrent of purple thunderlight erupted, pouring out like a Great Flood.

This was the Calamity power Zhang Yu had continuously collected using Kunlun in the Palm in conjunction with his Immortal Space as he advanced.

Now, he unleashed this power in a single breath. Its earth-shattering momentum completely suppressed the raging Calamity and the incoming sword qi.

Sensing the Calamity power Zhang Yu had accumulated for so long, True Monarch Immortal Slayer's gaze finally changed. It wasn't shock or surprise, but a fury he hadn't shown since the battle began.

"As expected..." True Monarch Immortal Slayer stared deadly at Zhang Yu's palm. "I sensed something was wrong before. Now, observing it up close, I've confirmed it: this space of yours is no Great Void Cloud Repository."

"This space... it shouldn't belong to you."

True Monarch Immortal Slayer roared, "Who gave it to you?!"

As Zhang Yu instantly unleashed the Calamity power he had accumulated for so long, the momentum was so fierce and overwhelming that True Monarch Immortal Slayer was forced to retreat repeatedly.

Zhang Yu had no intention of answering him.

But whether Zhang Yu answered or not, and regardless of what he might say, True Monarch Immortal Slayer, having observed him repeatedly at close range, had already arrived at the answer in his heart.

"Grandmaster... why?"

"Why would he give this power to you?!"

The killing intent in True Monarch Immortal Slayer's eyes intensified. "Zhang Yu, I don't know how you tricked him into giving you this power, but you have betrayed the Immortal's trust."

"Today, I will take back what he bestowed upon you."

---

True Monarch Miraculous Hand, who had just withdrawn from the formation core, turned back to witness the earth-shattering battle between Zhang Yu and True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

Watching the earth vaporize layer by layer under the ravaging Calamity, a lingering fear chilled his heart.

Beside him, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, whose head had just been reattached, spoke with a strained voice, "Such terrifying Calamity power... Even if you and I joined forces, I doubt we could last long against it."

True Monarch Miraculous Hand nodded. "But Immortal Slayer is even more terrifying. He not only dodges such a Calamity with the ease of a leisurely stroll but can even turn it to his own use. It seems he wasn't fighting at full strength before at all."

At this thought, True Monarch Miraculous Hand's gaze on the fierce battle within the formation core grew increasingly worried. "Can Zhang Yu defeat him?"

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter sighed. "Zhang Yu's advantage lies in his defense, which constantly adapts to his opponent and their attacks."

"But True Monarch Immortal Slayer converts the Calamity into his own sword qi. The stronger the Calamity, the stronger his sword technique becomes."

"It's like the strongest shield against the strongest sword. If they continue fighting, it will come down to who can endure longer."

"But if this truly drags on..."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter looked up at the streaks of Soul Transformation Divine Light in the sky and sighed again. "If this drags on, I fear the Soul Transformation War will take an unexpected turn."

---

Elsewhere, True Monarch Junior College, no longer daring to give chase, watched the fierce battle in the formation core from afar, his heart pounding with shock.

"The Calamity summoned by the Divine Power Network is like a toy in their hands," he thought, horrified. "They've completely turned it into a weapon, amplifying their destructive power hundreds, even thousands of times."

"Their combat styles and strategic frameworks are far beyond any other Nascent Soul cultivator present."

"Blazing Light and Immortal Slayer... they are now the strongest Nascent Souls on the Second to Fifth Layers."

"The outcome of this battle no longer has anything to do with the rest of us."

"The future of this fight depends solely on them — on which of them, Blazing Light or Immortal Slayer, is truly the strongest Nascent Soul here and now."

"But overall..." True Monarch Junior College analyzed inwardly, "True Monarch Immortal Slayer still has the advantage."

"After all, Zhang Yu's foundation isn't as deep as Immortal Slayer's. He has also consumed more Magic Power and other resources."

"If this continues, Zhang Yu will likely be the first to collapse."

Meanwhile, True Monarch Severing Clouds, now only a torso, stared blankly at the scene. He watched as the Calamity was ruthlessly manipulated and brutally exploited by Immortal Slayer and Zhang Yu, realizing their strength had far surpassed his wildest expectations.

"But Zhang Yu... will still lose!"

"He can't outlast True Monarch Immortal Slayer, and besides, we still have so many people here..."

As more and more experts from the Righteous Qi Alliance gathered, True Monarch Severing Clouds seemed to regain his confidence. "Zhang Yu won't last much longer."

---

In the Soul Transformation Battlefield.

"Good."

Numerous Divine Monarchs also split off a wisp of their consciousness to observe this crucial battle.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus of Heavenly Demon University watched Zhang Yu break through numerous obstacles and charge into the formation core to battle True Monarch Immortal Slayer. She immediately said, "As long as True Monarch Blazing Light can defeat Immortal Slayer, there will be a chance to break the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation."

But as the two continued their fierce struggle and True Monarch Immortal Slayer gradually gained the upper hand, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's brow furrowed.

"This Immortal Slayer's strength is tyrannical. Even a Five-Star Calamity can't stop him."

Nearby, Divine Monarch Nether Spring sighed. "Immortal Slayer is clearly not channeling a Calamity into his sword qi for the first time. His proficiency is far greater than Zhang Yu's."

"I fear he has used this Calamity-channeling combat style before, perhaps even deliberately practiced it."

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets of Immortal Armaments University sighed. "I've never heard of anyone doing such a thing below the Tenth Layer."

"This means he did this kind of thing above the Tenth Layer," Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus said. "Or perhaps his previous life, or even the life before that, did it and passed the memories down to him."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring said gravely, "This Immortal Slayer's background is anything but simple. His combat experience is far superior to Zhang Yu's. The situation... is grim."

Meanwhile, facing True Monarch Immortal Slayer — who could wield the Calamity as his sword and strike with the power of Heaven and Earth — Zhang Yu, who could only endure the Calamity head-on, seemed increasingly outmatched.

Seeing Zhang Yu forced to release the Calamity's power he had just absorbed, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's brow tightened further. "Has he been pushed this far?" she thought.

"Magnetic Pole! Greenwood!" Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus sent a message. "We must find a way to help Zhang Yu. If he loses, the Righteous Qi Alliance will gain complete control of this great formation."

---

Meanwhile, the power Zhang Yu had absorbed into his Immortal Space was gradually being depleted.

True Monarch Immortal Slayer, who had just been repeatedly forced back, now surged forward, wrapped in even more formidable sword qi.

But this time, as he controlled the sword qi, he also formed a Dao Seal with his hand and began circulating the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture.

The Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture was an Immortal Sect Technique that Fu Xiantian had once introduced to Zhang Yu.

As Fu Xiantian's disciple, True Monarch Immortal Slayer had also mastered this cultivation art.

At this moment, as he unleashed the technique — a cultivation art that directly pointed to the Great Dao of Reincarnation — it emanated an aura of profound and unfathomable mystery.

He pointed a finger at Zhang Yu and said coldly, "Zhang Yu, I originally had no intention of using this move so lightly."

"But your strength has truly exceeded my expectations — all because you wield power that should not belong to you."
