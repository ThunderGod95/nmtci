# Chapter 454: Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power

January 1st.

Myriad Laws University City, 19th underground level.

Director Lin stared impassively at Zhang Yu. "If you can tunnel through the passage in these blueprints within three hours, I'll consider you to have passed this test."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly and approached the cavern entrance. As he shifted his palm seal, streams of earth and sand began peeling away from the rock face.

In the blink of an eye, the tunnel's depth visibly increased at an astonishing pace.

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu changed the seal on his left palm and abruptly thrust it upward.

Metallic powder surged from the ground, coalescing into crude metal supports that reinforced the reshaped tunnel walls, stabilizing the subterranean space.

Zhang Yu continued to strike the tunnel walls with palm after palm, each blow propelling him forward through the rumbling, shaking earth.

This relentless underground advance felt like navigating an endless, disorienting darkness, a journey that could easily breed frustration, doubt, and even fear.

Zhang Yu pressed onward silently, each palm strike suppressing the earth's resistance.

Compared to the hardships he had endured along the way, excavating this tunnel was nothing.

For two hours, Zhang Yu advanced step by step, palm strike by palm strike.

With another explosive rupture of the rock strata, starlight streamed down from the night sky, illuminating his path.

Emerging from the long, dark underground passage, Zhang Yu gazed at the twinkling stars and felt a sudden surge of emotion.

It was like wandering in darkness for ages, finally catching a glimpse of a rare, bright future.

At that moment, Zhang Yu sighed deeply and murmured, "Finally, it's done."

Mastering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power meant he had truly distinguished himself at Myriad Laws University, gaining a genuine chance to join a Sect.

Soon after, Director Lin emerged from the tunnel, nodded at Zhang Yu, and said, "You've passed."

"I've already sent you the electronic version and usage rights for the Seventh Absolute."

With that, Director Lin vanished in a flash.

Zhang Yu eagerly opened the electronic version of the Seventh Absolute, immediately beginning to cultivate the Kunyuan Art.

As the final technique of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering, the Kunyuan Art allowed for the temporary compression of material density. By circulating Gang Qi, it could subject matter within a hundred meters to immense pressure. However, it was also the most complex and difficult to master among the Seven Absolutes.

After Zhang Yu practiced the Kunyuan Art, he sensed a peculiar transformation in the Gang Qi he emitted. It could suddenly expand and contract, forming a high-density field.

Instead of rushing to attempt the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, Zhang Yu continued to quietly cultivate the Kunyuan Art, delving into its profound mysteries.

After an entire night, as the first rays of dawn painted the sky, Zhang Yu felt it was time to comprehend the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

Just then, a message from True Person Scorching Thunder appeared in his Bionic Eye.

True Person Scorching Thunder: Zhang Yu, Teacher Yin said you skipped class. What's going on?

Zhang Yu froze, inwardly cursing his oversight. He had become so engrossed in his martial arts practice that he had forgotten to request leave.

Zhang Yu: Teacher, I didn't skip class. I just forgot to ask for leave.

True Person Scorching Thunder: Overtime?

Zhang Yu: I was completely absorbed in cultivating our department's military-grade martial art, the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. I was on the verge of mastering it, so I need to take a day off.

Zhang Yu: Teacher, please explain this properly to the lecturers and my classmates. Tell them the real reason I missed class. I don't want them to think I'm just skipping class casually.

Reading Zhang Yu's message, True Person Scorching Thunder cursed under his breath, "This brat... Am I helping you show off?"

After closing the chat window, Zhang Yu refocused on the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering.

The Profound Yellow Mountain-Suppressing Seal, Great Wilderness Mountain-Shifting Force, Earth Manipulation Divine Transformation, Dragon Vein Sensing Manual, Point Earth to Steel, Fingertip Earth to Gold, and Kunyuan Art flowed through his mind one by one.

Each cultivation art began circulating within his body in succession.

In an instant, profound insights into these seven techniques flashed through his mind like thunderbolts, culminating in a sudden breakthrough.

The ground around Zhang Yu began to tremble violently. Grains of sand, as if freed from gravity's pull, rose in wisps and strands, drifting upward.

Next, his clothes seemed to break free from earthly bonds, floating upward one by one.

Finally, each strand of Zhang Yu's hair swayed gently, as if submerged deep underwater.

One hour passed...

Two hours passed...

Three hours passed...

Suddenly, a sharp glint flashed in Zhang Yu's eyes. With a whoosh, he shot skyward, rapidly distancing himself from the earth.

At that moment, Zhang Yu resembled a fish swimming through the air, tracing graceful arcs high above. He moved as if drifting through an invisible ocean of atmosphere.

Eventually, he inverted himself, arms outstretched as if embracing the vast earth below, or perhaps as if supporting the world with his hands.

Then, as Zhang Yu shifted his hand seals, he abruptly halted mid-air, gazing down at the boundless earth beneath him with an entranced expression.

"Finally... I've mastered it."

A soft click echoed from his Bionic Eye.

Zhang Yu had already snapped a photo of himself.

Having finally mastered the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, he couldn't resist posting it on his social media.

With a photo of himself suspended upside down in the sky, gazing down at the earth, Zhang Yu wrote: "Is this what it looks like to wield the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power?"

Mo Shangjin: Congratulations!

Tu Lishan: Great shot! Send me the original.

Director Gao: 💐💐💐

Yu Xinghan: Take me flying next time!

Le Mulan: Amazing! Teacher Yin wants to see you again.

Su Yanyang: Brother! Awesome! We're counting on you for the competition now!

Ye Xingli: [3 Spirit Coins] Congrats! I'll add you to our Myriad Laws military group later — it's only for those who've mastered military-grade power.

Gongshu Jin: [1 Spirit Coin] Senior Brother, let's team up for the competition again next year if you have time!

Ying Xin: Congratulations, Senior Brother! I've got some new stock. I'll drop it off after school today.

Zhao Tianxing: [Excited]

Casually scrolling through the messages, Zhang Yu received a video call from Bai Zhenzhen.

A projection materialized, showing Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen hanging upside down in the sky, suspended in mid-air.

"Yu Zi, you did it!"

---

Heavenly Sword University.

Bai Zhenzhen smiled at Zhang Yu on the other side.

With a flick of her long hair, she unleashed a storm of sword light that slashed in all directions.

In an instant, the air within hundreds of meters roared with sword energy, carving dozens of meters deep gashes into the earth.

Unimpeded, streaks of sword light shot skyward, tearing fissures through the clouds.

The four students were forced into a desperate retreat, overwhelmed by the sword light emanating from Bai Zhenzhen's hair, their lives hanging by a thread.

As cracks appeared in their Bionics, one of them shouted frantically, "Eldest Senior Sister! Eldest Senior Sister!"

Another cried out, "Eldest Senior Sister! Watch out for us! You're going to kill someone!"

Wen Wuya spat out a beam of sword light that coiled like a white dragon, intercepting Bai Zhenzhen's attacks. "Zhenzhen, focus!" he roared. "Your Sword Intent surges with your emotions. A moment's distraction could cost lives!"

Bai Zhenzhen waved dismissively, signaling that she was fine. Gradually, the sword light subsided.

One of the students, who had barely managed to defend himself, turned to Wen Wuya. "Senior Brother! How did Eldest Senior Sister's Sword Intent become so ferocious all of a sudden?"

Wen Wuya explained, "Military-grade cultivation techniques are inherently unreasonable and defy common sense."

"Bai Zhenzhen's Seven Emotions Sword Dao is a prime example."

"One sword, seven emotions; sever all emotions."

"Every fluctuation in her emotions can dramatically amplify the power of the Seven Emotions Sword Dao, allowing her spiritual energy to influence the material world."

"Bai Zhenzhen must have been overwhelmed with joy and excitement, causing the Blissful Slash's power to surge."

The student continued, "Is Eldest Senior Sister chatting with her First Layer friend again? She seems so fond of that person, always so cheerful during their calls. If she brought them to the Ten Great Leagues, wouldn't her combat prowess skyrocket?"

Wen Wuya replied calmly, "The seven emotions and six desires aren't so easily understood. Sometimes, daily interactions yield little emotional turbulence, while rare encounters can trigger profound shifts in Sword Intent."

"Moreover, if she were constantly happy, how could she harness the power of her other sword techniques?"

Shortly after finishing his call with Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu received a message from his older sister.

Zhang Pianpian: "Mastering a military-grade cultivation technique in under three years? That's quite the show-off."

Zhang Yu: "What can I say? I just ended up here without realizing it."

Zhang Pianpian: "Anyway, congratulations on reaching this point."

Zhang Pianpian: "With chaos brewing and the situation rapidly changing, and you representing the school in the competition, I'm worried you might be in danger."

Zhang Pianpian: "Getting this far wasn't easy. You need to be extra cautious."

Zhang Pianpian: "If you run into any trouble, contact me immediately."

Zhang Yu: "Got it. You be careful too."

Zhang Yu: "Safety first."

Reading her younger brother's message, Zhang Pianpian's lips curved into a faint, almost imperceptible smile.

Yan Qianji, standing beside her, remarked, "Oh, you actually know how to smile? Did your stocks go up? What's got you so cheerful?"

Zhang Pianpian replied coolly, "None of your business. Let's focus on our work."

In the Spirit Realm where Zhang Pianpian now stood, numerous faculty and students from the Artifact Refinement and Talisman Departments had gathered around a colossal statue.

This statue represented the High-Intelligence Spirit Artifact of Divine Monarch Jade Nectar within the Spirit Realm.

Zhang Pianpian and the other Talisman Department students had come here to assist True Monarch Magnetic Pole in deciphering the artifact spirit before them.

But in the next moment, as eyes materialized across the statue's surface, an androgynous voice echoed through the Spirit Realm:

"Do you... really want to work so badly?"

"Don't you... want to Dual Cultivate?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole scoffed. "This artifact spirit has gone mad. Be careful not to be swayed by its illusions."

"Keep working hard. Three more days of overtime at triple pay, and it'll crack."

The artifact spirit's voice rang out again: "Fools! I am not the one being swayed — it is you."
