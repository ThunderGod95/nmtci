# Chapter 634: The Battle of Fines

Dark clouds churned across the sky, punctuated by flashes of lightning and thunderous roars.

Beneath this tempestuous canopy, a raging torrent surged toward the heavens, meeting the rising Great Sun.

Amidst this maelstrom of wind, rain, lightning, and fire, Zhang Yu and Ying Mingchi clashed fiercely.

As their battle intensified, the audience watching the spectacle steadily grew.

A quick check of the Spirit Realm would reveal that within the spaces where various monsterfolk gathered, news of Ying Mingchi and Zhang Yu's duel was spreading like wildfire.

"Zhang Yu, the monsterfolk-insulting scum, is about to get his ass kicked!"

"Ying Mingchi, the top student at Celestial Monsters University, is giving Zhang Yu a brutal lesson!"

"The monsterfolk discriminator is getting a beatdown and being humiliated beyond belief!"

"Ying Mingchi is going to brutally sword Zhang Yu! He'll make that trash give birth to a monster child!"

Fueled by this propaganda, the already highly anticipated battle exploded in popularity. More and more monsterfolk flocked to witness Zhang Yu's "inevitable defeat," their eyes burning with anticipation.

The voices spreading these rumors originated from Soul Cultivators in the Finance Department of Myriad Laws University.

This was Zhang Yu's request to Nine Heavens Liu: to use the Finance Department's online marketing team to amplify the hype surrounding his duel with Ying Mingchi.

When Nine Heavens Liu asked Zhang Yu what he wanted, Zhang Yu had considered various rewards: magical artifacts, Bionics, even Spirit Coins.

If Zhang Yu couldn't defeat Ying Mingchi, he might have chosen to take the money without hesitation. But since he aimed to win the Ten Greats League championship, his strategy had to be different.

"Instead of a one-time deal, I should use this opportunity to further boost my popularity and elevate my Immortal Dao Potential," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "Spirit Coins are just a single transaction and I wouldn't get many anyway."

"But popularity and online traffic can generate sustained income and better represent my Immortal Dao Potential than mere Spirit Coins."

"It's like an amplifier, amplifying the impact of every victory I achieve from now on."

*Boom!*

Amidst the torrential rain, the man and the dragon clashed violently.

With a roar, Ying Mingchi's white dragon form convulsed violently. As his flesh and blood swelled explosively, another giant dragon erupted from his body.

This was the military-grade cultivation technique of Celestial Monsters University — the Seamless Monster Form Great Art.

Through self-replication and self-propagation, the Seamless Monster Form Great Art instantly conjured three giant dragons transformed from Ying Mingchi.

One dragon burrowed into the dark clouds, continuing to shrink the torrential rain and resist the divine punishment.

Another dragon engaged Zhang Yu in a fierce, tumbling battle.

The remaining dragon plunged into the raging torrent unleashed by the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, summoning hordes of aquatic Demon Beasts.

"Zhang Yu," the three Ying Mingchi said in unison, "when it comes to breeding techniques, we monsterfolk are the true ancestors."

In the next instant, Ying Mingchi led a massive horde of aquatic Demon Beasts to attack the Demon Beasts Zhang Yu was breeding in the water.

A bloody mist erupted within the raging torrent as the two sides' bred creatures clashed, leaving a trail of corpses in their wake.

But with each dragon roar, Zhang Yu's Demon Beasts trembled, their combat power plummeted, and they were swiftly driven back.

Just as Ying Mingchi thought he was about to completely annihilate the enemy's aquatic army, he noticed dragon shadows gradually emerging from their ranks.

"What's this?"

Ying Mingchi stared in shock at the slender, diminutive, fish-like yet dragon-like monstrosity Zhang Yu had bred.

Zhang Yu chuckled. "Little dragon, why don't you greet your descendants?"

Despite the vast difference in appearance, Ying Mingchi could clearly sense that this was a dragon beast bred from his own bloodline.

"This bastard stole my Monster Blood during our fight and used it to breed temporary combat units?"

With the emergence of these dragon beasts, Zhang Yu's aquatic army immediately withstood the dragon roar and, aided by the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor's water manipulation abilities, gradually turned the tide.

"How did he do that?"

Ying Mingchi thought to himself, "Such advanced breeding techniques? Could this scum also know the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture? Impossible! That cultivation art is something monsterfolk inherit through their bloodline. How could a Human Race member who so openly discriminates against monsterfolk possibly learn it?"

"Then how? How could he create dragon beasts using my bloodline so quickly?"

Though these were merely temporary combat units, seeing a Human Race member who openly discriminated against monsterfolk display such advanced breeding techniques filled Ying Mingchi with both shock and fury.

He quickly suppressed these emotions, refocusing his attention on the battle before him.

Ying Mingchi opened his dragon maw wide and roared, "You didn't buy the combat rights to my Monster Blood! How dare you — "

Ying Mingchi knew that whether Monster Blood was used for research papers or combat, using it without purchasing the rights constituted infringement. Even if it wasn't as serious as illegally breeding offspring, it would still incur a hefty fine.

Zhang Yu's Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power surged violently as he slammed a palm strike at Ying Mingchi. Behind him, projected characters materialized in the air: "A fine? So what?"

"I'll pay it after the match!"

Hu Yuntao: "You little beast!"

"Afraid of a fine? What are you even doing in the Ten Greats League?"

At that moment, watching Zhang Yu fight with such blatant disregard for copyright infringement and fines, countless spectators felt a sense of his immense wealth and genuine coolness.

This defiant stance, fighting even at the cost of fines, struck countless viewers as far more imposing than Zhang Yu's previous desperate struggles.

Though many monsterfolk loathed and despised Zhang Yu, they couldn't deny that his aura now rivaled Ying Mingchi's.

Ying Mingchi's heart jolted. His dragon eyes narrowed as he roared, "Good! You scum! Let's settle this!"

With that, the white dragon that had been shrinking the rain clouds joined the fray.

The two dragons immediately engaged Zhang Yu in a fierce battle, plunging from the sky into the depths of the sea. The remaining white dragon and the underwater legions surged into the conflict.

Zhang Yu, who had bred four dragon beasts in total, now stood astride two of them, with the other two circling him. He led a towering tsunami and a vast, shadowy underwater army as he charged toward Ying Mingchi once more.

As the combatants clashed in a chaotic maelstrom, copyright infringement warnings flashed incessantly across Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

In Ying Mingchi's vision, weather penalty notifications scrolled endlessly.

Yet neither man nor dragon cared. They seemed willing to be fined into bankruptcy, even to the point of soul scattering and spirit extinguishing, just to utterly crush their opponent, to slaughter until the heavens and earth were overturned!

Boom!

Amid the brutal carnage, the surging floodwaters were littered with Demon Beast corpses. Under the manipulation of Zhang Yu's Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon, these corpses swiftly transformed into makeshift flying swords, joining his relentless assault.

As the temporary flying swords reached critical mass, a dense canopy of sword shadows completely enveloped the three giant dragons, forming a sword formation that locked onto Ying Mingchi.

Ying Mingchi had long studied Zhang Yu's tactics and anticipated this move.

"Scum!" Ying Mingchi roared. "I saw this coming!"

The three giant dragons, transformed from Ying Mingchi, unleashed a thunderous roar. Behind them, the Monster Summoning Banner shuddered violently, unleashing countless monsterfolk Soul Cultivators who surged toward the Demon Beast corpses, seizing control of the flying swords.

Watching the swords suddenly turn against Zhang Yu, Ying Mingchi cackled wildly. The three dragons flashed into motion, each extending a claw and unleashing the Celestial Monster Myriad Transformations Technique to its full potential. Each dragon transformed its claws into three different monsterfolk types, creating nine monstrous claws that converged on Zhang Yu like a pack of nine-headed demons.

Zhang Yu sneered, instantly retracting the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon, reverting the flying swords back into corpses. As the three dragons closed in, his body shuddered violently, erupting in a shower of Demon Beast flesh and blood.

"Hmm?" Ying Mingchi's heart sank. Beneath the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, Zhang Yu had been replaced by a Demon Beast doppelganger.

"He used the Monster Summoning Banner to forcibly control a temporary flying sword, then suppressed my Spirit Realm communication with the Sword Realm, concealing his presence from my senses..."

Even as Ying Mingchi's mind raced with these thoughts, the gravitational field emitted by the Seven Absolutes Bionic had already locked onto the three giant dragons.

In the next instant, Zhang Yu, enveloped in Eternal Sun Radiance Flame, charged forward, engaging the three dragons in a chaotic melee.

The Heavenly Sun Radiance God expanded violently, engulfing a hundred-meter radius in Eternal Sun Radiance Flame, incinerating Zhang Yu and the three dragons alike.

Though the Eternal Sun Radiance Flame wouldn't directly burn Zhang Yu, the intense heat would inevitably affect him.

*Roar!*

Amidst a roar of shock and fury, Ying Mingchi roared, "Are you insane? You're burning yourself too!"

Zhang Yu grinned at him. "Afraid you can't afford the medical bills? Then surrender."

Simultaneously, torrents of water enveloped the Eternal Sun Radiance Flame, combining with the inner and outer sword formations formed by twenty-four Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords to create a water prison, preventing any living creature from escaping the Sea of Fire.

Ying Mingchi's gaze sharpened. Breaking through this water prison wouldn't be difficult for him, but with Zhang Yu's layered defenses and relentless attacks... it wouldn't be a swift escape.

Recalling the moment Zhang Yu activated the sword formation, Ying Mingchi gradually realized the truth.

"He didn't recite the sponsor's name during the activation, which means he never intended to win with the sword formation."

"That brat... he's been trying to drag me into this situation from the very beginning."

"He wants to gamble his life against mine."

A sinister grin spread across Ying Mingchi's three dragon heads. "Scum! Who gave you the audacity to fight me like this?"

"My body is far superior to you humans..."

Zhang Yu replied calmly, "Then let's see who breaks first."

Within the Sea of Fire formed by the Eternal Sun Radiance Flame, the two engaged in a desperate battle.

Initially, Ying Mingchi was brimming with confidence, but his emotions quickly shifted to confusion, then bewilderment, followed by disorientation, and finally, fear, terror, and despair...

The weather penalty weighed heavily on Ying Mingchi's mind, intensifying his psychological pressure with each passing moment.

Roar!

The giant dragon roared, desperate to escape the Sea of Fire, only to be yanked back by a pair of charred, massive hands.

"Why?"

"Why isn't this human dead yet?"

When the Sea of Fire dissipated, Zhang Yu stood scorched and blackened, holding the half-dead Ying Mingchi by his remaining torso.

Myriad Laws University, Zhang Yu, wins!
