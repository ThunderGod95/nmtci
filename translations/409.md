# Chapter 409: Advanced - Martial Dao Holy Body (8/8)

As news of the Dual Rest Cult's terrorist attack on the Pharmaceutical Factory spread, anti-cult propaganda began appearing throughout Myriad Laws University's University City.

In the Foundation Establishment Class group chat:

True Person Scorching Thunder: "@everyone, to further promote anti-cult awareness among university students, focusing on mental health education and enhancing students' ability to recognize and resist evil cults, please attend the "Dangers of Dual Rest" educational lecture tonight from 18:30 to 19:00."

Zhang Yu, reading the message, thought to himself, "This reaction is bigger than I expected!"

Although Zhang Yu had personally witnessed the aftermath of the Dual Rest Cult's attack, he considered such a minor terrorist incident to be no more than a skin irritation for Kunxu and the Ten Greats.

He doubted that a few suicidal attacks by Soul Cultivators could cause any real change in Kunxu.

Moreover, feedback from the factory workers suggested that the Dual Rest Cult lacked popular support.

Yet, seeing True Person Scorching Thunder's announcement, Zhang Yu wondered, "Could this Dual Rest Cult actually pose a significant threat to universities and companies?"

"Damn it..." Zhang Yu couldn't help but mutter to himself, "Kunxu is such a messed up place. Selling drugs, dual cultivation, murder... you guys never reacted this strongly before!"

That day after school, while working on the Pharmaceutical Factory construction, Zhang Yu tuned in to a lecture on "The Dangers of Dual Rest."

A Righteous God was speaking: "...In recent years, the Dual Rest Cult has infiltrated the Spirit Realm, distorting values and even causing many to miss job opportunities, become unemployed, declare bankruptcy, and suffer tragic consequences..."

"I know you're all top students from Myriad Laws University, but don't think this Evil Cult only preys on Junior College Students. We've personally captured many brainwashed Ten Greats Students, including some who were once exemplary, tireless scholars..."

"The Dual Rest Cult possesses terrifying mental control abilities. Once exposed, even Graduate and Doctoral students can be brainwashed within minutes!"

"Therefore, if you encounter a Dual Rest Cult member, you must immediately contact the Righteous Gods..."

With a thunderous crash, the Formless Warrior slammed its palm down, sweeping away a massive pile of construction debris!

Layers of azure light surged within the Formless Warrior, as the Azure Heaven Sand tumbled back and forth inside. Empowered by the sand, the warrior now possessed a more tangible presence, with significantly enhanced explosive power and endurance.

While the Formless Warrior worked, Zhang Yu practiced his martial arts while listening to the lecture.

He wondered, "Are the Righteous Gods targeting this Dual Rest Cult?"

"Could there be an Evil God lurking behind the cult?"

Zhang Yu shared his doubts with Lady Fortune. After a moment's contemplation, she said, "The Dual Rest Cult... I heard of it long ago, but only in the schemes of certain Evil Gods."

"Whether they later turned that scheme into reality, I can't say for sure."

"But if this cult truly involves Evil Gods, and has drawn the Righteous Gods' attention yet remains uneradicated, then there must be more than one High-Ranking Evil God behind it — perhaps several!"

Shortly after the lecture ended, Zhang Yu received another message from Feng Tingting.

Feng Tingting: Junior Brother, have you heard?

Feng Tingting: The true financial backer of the Dual Rest Cult is Netherworld University!

Feng Tingting: Netherworld University deliberately infiltrated the Dual Rest Cult into other universities to bewitch their students, corrupt their minds, and turn them into lazy dogs who refuse to work two days a month, thereby undermining the competitiveness of other universities and companies!

Feng Tingting: Rumor has it that after a vocational college was corrupted by the Dual Rest Cult and implemented a monthly Dual Rest policy, the entire institution went bankrupt!

As Zhang Yu listened to Feng Tingting's gossip, more questions flooded his mind.

He asked curiously, "Does the Dual Rest Cult really have ties to Netherworld University?"

Lady Fortune replied, "Who knows? It could be Myriad Laws University spreading false rumors to smear their rivals. Or perhaps Netherworld University is actually sponsoring the Evil Cult to infiltrate other schools!"

Soon after, Zhang Yu noticed that the Spirit Realm Network was rife with rumors linking Netherworld University to the Dual Rest Cult. The university swiftly issued a statement denying any connection to the cult, condemning external forces for spreading false rumors and engaging in cyberbullying...

Zhang Yu then discovered that people on the Spirit Realm Network were claiming that the Dual Rest Cult was backed by Myriad Laws University!

Immediately, the Spirit Realm Network erupted into a series of flame wars, with various influencers, powerhouses, and wealthy individuals taking turns to voice their opinions!

"What a complete mess!" Zhang Yu remarked. "Are Myriad Laws and the Netherworld using this opportunity to smear each other?"

Lady Fortune chuckled. "Heh, who knows? But one thing's for sure: the Dual Rest Cult is making quite a splash. They've even become a tool for the Ten Greats to attack each other!"

"If I have time, I'd like to personally investigate the Dual Rest Cult's proselytization methods and their actual doctrines," Zhang Yu said.

Despite the widespread condemnation of the Dual Rest Cult across all realms, Zhang Yu only knew that they advocated for two days of rest per month. He was completely unaware of their other doctrines or their full agenda.

It was clear that the Righteous Gods were heavily monitoring the Spirit Realm Network, ruthlessly suppressing any Dual Rest Cult propaganda and preventing ordinary people from accessing such content.

Time flew by, and it was already late January.

The Pharmaceutical Factory continued its relentless expansion.

Zhang Yu had taken on one construction project after another here, visiting almost every day!

On the construction site that day, the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch floated in mid-air, occasionally spewing out large swaths of Azure Heaven Sand that poured into the Formless Warriors as they scurried back and forth!

Zhao Tianxing, who was operating the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch, glanced toward the center of the site, where a dense cloud of mist shrouded an area. Through the swirling vapors, he could faintly discern flickering figures and hear intermittent bursts of thunderous roars!

Zhao Tianxing knew this was Zhang Yu practicing his martial dao techniques. However, during each training session on the construction site, Zhang Yu would shroud himself in Gang Qi, obscuring his movements and making it impossible to discern which cultivation art he was practicing!

Moments later, the swirling mist enveloping Zhang Yu stilled, and the continuous thunderous roars ceased!

Zhao Tianxing wondered aloud, "Zhang Yu has stopped training?"

Simultaneously, deep within the cloud of mist formed by the Formless Cloud Gang, Zhang Yu sensed the Martial Dao Holy Body's Second Layer effect activating after pushing his eighth cultivation art to Level 10!

Advanced - Martial Dao Holy Body (8/8): Martial Dao Micro-Control. Any Foundation Establishment Stage martial dao technique in your hands will be controlled with microscopic precision, allowing for effortless mastery and manipulation!

"Martial Dao Micro-Control?"

Zhang Yu immediately began testing the second layer effect of his Martial Dao Holy Body and quickly grasped its profound mysteries.

With a thunderous palm strike, he unleashed the Great Wilderness Mountain-Shifting Force. His entire body surged with a torrent of combined physical strength and Gang Qi. Every ounce of power, every wisp of Gang Qi, was crystal clear in his perception, flowing as effortlessly as 1 + 1 = 2. With a single, effortless strike, he pulverized the earth before him into fine dust.

"Martial Dao Micro-Control... grants me unprecedented mastery over my power when executing martial dao techniques!"

Zhang Yu knew that even martial arts of the same rank, with identical physical strength stats, could fluctuate in power depending on one's state of mind and the technique's execution.

But now, under the influence of Martial Dao Micro-Control, he could clearly sense that every move and stance he executed reached its absolute peak potential.

Moreover...

With a stomp of his foot, the Profound Yellow Mountain-Suppressing Seal activated. Layers of Profound Yellow Qi surged forth, causing the surrounding sand and dust to shift in weight and density... abruptly coalescing into swirling tornadoes!

At the same moment, the Formless Warrior nearby trembled. Its original state — a vague humanoid figure composed of Gang Qi — suddenly transformed, manifesting Zhang Yu's exact likeness. The Gang Qi coalesced into a lifelike human form, a perfect replica of Zhang Yu himself!

"Martial Dao Micro-Control allows me to enhance both my destructive power and my precision in handling details. I can now focus my strength within an extremely small area..."

Empowered by the Martial Dao Holy Body, Zhang Yu felt his work efficiency had increased by severalfold. However, he still needed to explore the full potential of this technique through further experimentation.

Just then, Zhang Yu noticed a large group of people storming into the Pharmaceutical Factory!

Qu Lecheng, his forehead drenched in sweat, faced the group. "We've been operating at full capacity every day, without a single break!"

The group's leader replied coldly, "To crack down on the Dual Rest Cult, all of University City is now subject to random inspections for unauthorized production stoppages and malicious leave requests!"

"Furthermore, in response to directives from above, all factories must further extend their working hours!"

Qu Lecheng protested helplessly, "We're already operating 24 hours a day! How can we extend them further?"

The leader shrugged. "That's not my concern. You've been notified. Overcome the challenges yourself!"

In a deserted corner of the Pharmaceutical Factory, Zhang Yu, exhausted from a night of hard work, was receiving treatment from Xiao Qingxuan.

Although Zhang Yu could heal himself through bodily activation, Xiao Qingxuan's assistance could significantly accelerate the process, a benefit Zhang Yu was eager to accept.

During his time at the factory, Zhang Yu had frequently received Xiao Qingxuan's treatments, growing increasingly confident in his ancient medical techniques.

Noticing Xiao Qingxuan's somber expression, Zhang Yu asked, "Old Xiao, are you in a bad mood today?"

Xiao Qingxuan sighed, hesitated, then thought to himself, "Zhang Yu is now deeply trusted by Old Gao and is destined to become a pillar of the Civil Engineering Department. Graduate studies are inevitable for him, and after graduation, he'll likely either join the company or stay to teach in the department."

With this in mind, Xiao Qingxuan said, "You've probably heard that I was once possessed by an ancient Golden Core cultivator, right?"
