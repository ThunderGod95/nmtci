# Chapter 512: Zhang Yu's Golden Core Simulation Score

With a flash of light and shadow, a black-gold scroll slowly unfurled within Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye. Its ancient aura and regal hues evoked a sense of a hidden world opening before him.

"Welcome to Golden Core Direct."

"Golden Core Direct is a renowned free Golden Core guidance tool, offering features such as Golden Core scoring, cultivation guidance, cultivation flaw detection, Bionic testing, artifact spirit optimization, energy conservation and cooling, and intelligent upgrades — all at no cost."

"Would you like to use the Golden Core Direct Premium Edition?"

Seeing the two options below — "Log in with existing Premium Edition account" and "Purchase Premium Edition access" — Zhang Yu could only click the "X" in the upper right corner.

In an instant, the ancient aura and regal colors vanished. The original black-gold scroll transformed into something resembling a homework notebook, and some of its features seemed to have disappeared as well.

To Zhang Yu, it felt like a legendary martial arts manual had been reduced to basic fist techniques.

But he didn't mind. Ugly was ugly, and fewer features were fewer features — paying for it was out of the question.

As soon as he opened the notebook, a notification popped up in his Bionic Eye: "External service request detected: permission to scan? Yes/No"

Golden Core Compass: Bionic access not yet granted. Please grant access for more accurate scoring.

Zhang Yu, naturally unwilling to allow the system to scan his Bionics, immediately selected "No" and clicked the largest button on the workbook to begin the Golden Core simulation scoring.

During the simulation, Golden Core Compass repeatedly sent notifications requesting access to various parts of Zhang Yu's body.

Zhang Yu systematically denied each request.

This triggered a series of registration prompts, requiring Zhang Yu to manually enter detailed information about his body, including his Bionics, cultivation arts, and fundamental data.

If he could provide official school documentation, these entries would be verified.

Zhang Yu methodically filled out each field, though he only listed a fraction of the cultivation arts he had mastered.

He deliberately omitted black arts like the Immeasurable Heart Inner Dharma Body, as well as the Chain Formation Diagram and Dao Seed Register.

Once Zhang Yu completed the registration, his final score appeared: "You achieved a high score of 81,372 in the Golden Core simulation scoring, surpassing 86% of students. [Click to share]"

Golden Core Diagnostics: During the scoring process, 37 cultivation flaws were detected. Please rectify them as soon as possible. [Click to Rectify All]

Curious, Zhang Yu clicked through and discovered issues such as Hand Bionic deficiencies, Organ Bionic deficiencies, Spine Bionic deficiencies, and more. Each flaw was followed by a list of recommended Bionics.

Clearly, Zhang Yu's lack of Bionics had significantly lowered his score in this area.

In addition, the system suggested surgical modifications to enhance Magic Power circulation speed, Dantian configuration optimization, and muscle response speed optimization, offering a range of recommended surgical procedures, pharmacological enhancements, and daoist arts solidification methods.

Then came a series of issues related to cultivation art optimization, updates, and upgrades, followed by recommendations to use newer versions of cultivation arts or upgrade existing ones to compensate for specific deficiencies.

Staring at this litany of cultivation flaws, Zhang Yu, who had previously felt quite confident, suddenly felt riddled with weaknesses.

"Still, I definitely have room for improvement," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "Military-grade cultivation techniques, military-grade Bionics, military-grade magical artifacts... These aren't just necessary for winning the Ten Great Leagues; they'll be crucial for forging my Golden Core in the future."

"Once I win the Ten Great Leagues, I'll definitely max out my credits early and graduate a few years ahead of schedule."

"The sooner I finish these, the sooner I'll win the Ten Great Leagues, the sooner I'll graduate, and the sooner I'll break through to the Golden Core..."

As he closed the scoring results, a new leaderboard appeared, titled "Golden Core Potential Rankings."

"Golden Core Potential Rankings? Updated daily?"

Zhang Yu's heart stirred as he examined the list. "This must be the ranking for Foundation Establishment cultivators based on their simulated Golden Core performance."

He glanced through it and noticed a separate "True Golden Core Rankings" for cultivators already in the Golden Core Realm, but that was still too far off for Zhang Yu's interest.

"Since they know I'm a Foundation Establishment student, they automatically showed me the Golden Core Potential Rankings."

Zhang Yu instinctively looked at the top spot. "The first place is from Heavenly Demon University? 510,000 points?"

"Second place is from Myriad Laws University, Daoist Arts Department, Dao Qiankun, 509,881 points. That's barely behind first place!"

As Zhang Yu continued scrolling, he noticed the Golden Core Potential Rankings were almost entirely dominated by students from the Ten Greats universities.

He tried clicking on Dao Qiankun's name to see if he could view the cultivator's profile.

Clicking on the profile revealed only basic information: the individual was an undergraduate student in the Daoist Arts Department at Myriad Laws University.

Below the profile picture, the following details were listed but inaccessible: 3 cultivation flaws, 1233 cultivation change notifications, 99+ cultivation art practices, 7 Bionic equipment, Spiritual Root details, news updates, and more.

Golden Core Guidance: Purchase Premium Service to view more information.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "I'm not buying it."

Scrolling further down, Zhang Yu quickly found himself ranked beyond 500th place.

This wasn't because he was actually ranked so low, but because the Golden Core Seed Rankings only recorded the top 500. Below that, it simply displayed "Zhang Yu: 500+ (Not yet ranked in the Golden Core Seed Rankings)."

His exact ranking remained hidden.

As Zhang Yu browsed the rankings, notifications popped up in his Bionic Eye:

Golden Core Guidance: 37 cultivation flaws detected. [Click to view]

Golden Core Guidance: Your friend's potential score may be higher than yours. Pay to view other users' simulated scores.

Golden Core Guidance: Unencrypted sensitive Bionic detected.

Zhang Yu frowned slightly. "Unencrypted?"

Lady Fortune reminded him, "Just ignore it. They're trying to trick you into granting them access to your Bionic Eye."

"Your Bionic Eye was encrypted by Zhang Pianpian. With her Talisman cultivation, security shouldn't be an issue."

Glancing at the Golden Core Guidance notifications that kept popping up, Zhang Yu muttered, "This damn thing is so annoying."

Just then, a new notification caught his eye:

Golden Core Guidance: Share your benchmark data and receive an exclusive skin.

As Zhang Yu was running his Golden Core simulation score, deep within the Spirit Realm, in a small, private group inaccessible to outsiders, Zi Yunzhen, ranked fourth in the Artifact Refinement class, remarked, "He actually managed to transfer here."

Class Rank 4 Zi Yunzhen: "Zhang Yu has been studying Civil Engineering for three years. How could he possibly understand Artifact Refinement?"

Zi Yunzhen added resentfully, "And he immediately ranked 48th in the entire department and second in our class? What kind of nonsense is this?"

Zi Yunzhen: "Do those Civil Engineering scores even deserve to be converted?"

Zi Yunzhen: "Zhang Yu should have started over from first year. Why is he transferring to our third-year class?"

Another Artifact Refinement student named Rong Xuan chimed in, "I don't know what the director was thinking, accepting a Civil Engineering student."

Class Rank 8 Rong Xuan: "The Class Group now reeks of Civil Engineering."

Rong Xuan: "Sigh, I don't even want to post in that group anymore."

Rank 4 Zi Yunzhen: "But you were just welcoming him in the group earlier."

Rong Xuan: "We have to show respect to True Monarch Magnetic Pole, after all."

Rank 4 Zi Yunzhen: "A laboratory test subject paired with a Soul Transformation Yin Artifact? Playing around in the lab is one thing, but bringing him into the Artifact Refinement Department so openly? I heard he only has a Bionic Eye — no other Bionics on his body. It's truly... sigh..."

At that moment, the class's top student, Su Yunni, finally spoke up.

Su Yunni: "Be careful what you say."

Fourth-ranked Zi Yunzhen: "I'm just standing up for everyone."

Zi Yunzhen: "Why should someone from Civil Engineering, who hasn't spent a fraction of what we've invested in the Artifact Refinement Department over three years, suddenly be ahead of us?"

The small group erupted in debate, with most students expressing strong disapproval of Zhang Yu's transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department.

Just then, eighth-ranked Rong Xuan exclaimed: "Quick, check the Class Group! Zhang Yu just posted his Golden Core simulation score!"

Zhang Yu: "I achieved a high score of 81,372 in the Golden Core simulation, surpassing 86% of all students. [Click to share]"

This was now the highest Golden Core score in the entire class.

The previously noisy group fell silent instantly.

After a long pause, Zi Yunzhen slowly said: "How could his score be so high? Could he have cheated?"

Someone replied: "It's verified, so it's probably legitimate. Besides, cheating would only embarrass himself."

Su Yunni, the class's top student, said: "I checked his score breakdown using my premium membership."

Su Yunni: "The military-grade cultivation technique, Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, contributed significantly to his score."

Su Yunni: "Additionally, his solid foundation and mastery of multiple cultivation arts also played a crucial role."

Su Yunni: "If he had equipped more Bionics, his score would have been even higher."

Fourth-Rank Zi Yunzhen: "I see."

Zi Yunzhen: "The Civil Engineering Department's curriculum is simple, and there's little competition, which allowed him to obtain a military-grade cultivation technique early on."

Zi Yunzhen: "But even with the bonus points from the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, it doesn't help much with artifact refinement."

Zi Yunzhen: "Let him show off while he can. Once the final exam results are released, his overall ranking will definitely drop again."

Although most students in the Artifact Refinement Department shared similar sentiments, Zhang Yu's higher Golden Core simulation score silenced their mockery. They now planned to wait for the final exam to laugh at his artifact refinement results.

What could a Civil Engineering dog who's been slaving on construction sites for three years possibly know about artifact refinement?

Just then, First-Rank Su Yunni turned to Fourth-Rank Zi Yunzhen and asked, "When are you coming to work for my company?"

Zi Yunzhen: "I still need to consider a few things."

Su Yunni: "No problem. I'll keep a position open for you."

Zi Yunzhen knew that Su Yunni's magical artifact service company specialized in recycling used artifacts and providing maintenance services.

While joining her company might mean losing a significant portion of his earnings to commissions, it would guarantee a steady stream of clients and allow him to maintain his skills effectively.

Next, Zi Yunzhen contacted Ye Xingli: "Senior Sister, are you still taking commissions for the Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual?"

---

Having completed the Golden Core Direct Guide, Zhang Yu quickly arrived at the laboratory and resumed his cultivation art practice.  

Streams of True Fire erupted, fluctuating wildly in response to his Daoist incantations, burning the second-hand magical artifact before him.  

After several hours, the True Fire's color shifted, swirling around Zhang Yu like agile, swimming fish.  

Fire Control Divine Mirror: Level 10  

Zhang Yu's spirit surged. He thought, "The third cultivation art of this artifact refinement prodigy has finally reached Level 10! I'm one step closer to completing the Chain Formation Diagram."  

"Practicing the Fire Control Divine Mirror is such a hassle. Each second-hand magical artifact I burn costs a fortune, and if the refinement quality isn't high enough, it's hard to sell. This has really drained my funds."  

"With the Fire Control Divine Mirror at Level 10, whether I sell the refined artifacts directly or offer refinement services, they should be easier to sell now."  

Just then, Zhang Yu received a message.  

Ye Xingli: Junior Brother, are you still taking orders for the Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual?
