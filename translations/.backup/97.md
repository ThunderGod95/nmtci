# Chapter 95: Preparation, Dropping the Class

Upon hearing Bai Zhenzhen agree, Zhang Yu said, "I asked around, and there's still a shortage of teachers for basic high school cultivation techniques. I've been watching you train recently. Your level in those techniques shouldn't be low, right?"

More than two months ago, all of Bai Zhenzhen's basic high school cultivation techniques had already reached level 4 or 5.

And during this time, for the first time in her life, Bai Zhenzhen had gradually released the restraints on her spiritual root, using it to cultivate with wild abandon.

This brought her an unprecedented experience. As the spiritual root worked on her body twenty-four hours a day, it became more and more attuned to her, its effects growing ever greater.

Now, her basic high school cultivation techniques had almost all reached level 9 or 10.

Such astonishing progress was enough to attract the attention of countless experts, and even the companies.

So... should she tell Zhang Yu?

But then she thought about how Zhang Yu had been honest with her about something as perilous as the dark world of tutoring. As partners who had sworn to get into the Ten Greats together, wouldn't it be disloyal of her to keep hiding this?

_Zhang Pianpian already knows anyway._

_Besides, I've been trying to see if I can lend it to Yu-boy to play with recently, so he'll find out sooner or later..._

Thinking this, Bai Zhenzhen immediately leaned close to Zhang Yu and whispered into his ear, "I've basically trained all the basic cultivation techniques from the first year of high school to level 9 or 10."

Although he had long known Zhen was using a cheat, Zhang Yu was still slightly stunned when he heard these words.

He then recalled what the doll had said about the spiritual root during lunch and thought to himself, _Could this be related to the spiritual root in Zhen's stomach?_

And when the doll heard what Bai Zhenzhen said, it was also shaken. _Heavens! Where did this monster come from? Could it be that someone unlocked her potential too?_

Seeing Zhang Yu in a daze, Bai Zhenzhen first smiled smugly, then, with a desire to show off, she leaned in and whispered in his ear again, "Do you want to know how I did it?"

Zhang Yu rubbed his slightly itchy ear and said, "You can tell me whenever you want. It's fine if you don't want to, either."

_It's just a cheat, right? As if I don't have one._

Zhang Yu then continued speaking about the dark world of tutoring, "I'll go ask again tonight which high school basic courses are the most popular and which are most in need of teachers. You should prepare well these next few days, and I'll take you for a trial lesson then."

Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhang Yu in surprise, thinking, _Isn't Yu-boy the least bit curious how I managed to raise all my basic cultivation techniques to level 9 and 10 so quickly?_

She had been planning to tell him, but seeing Zhang Yu's nonchalant expression was like a child wanting to show off a treasured toy, only to find the adult completely uninterested, instantly draining all her enthusiasm for showing off.

_Hmph, just wait until my spiritual root can be taken out for you to use. Let's see if you beg me then._

With this thought, Bai Zhenzhen held her breath and went to the side to engage in ascetic training.

For the next few days, aside from preparing for the tutoring lessons with Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu spent most of his time wholeheartedly cultivating the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

On this day, Zhang Yu was cultivating with Bai Zhenzhen on the rooftop, a low hum emanating from his muscles and sinews.

He continuously tempered his muscles, internal organs, and even his bones and marrow, feeling his physical strength increase bit by bit under the nourishment of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill's medicinal power.

Zhang Yu could feel that this kind of cultivation was not just improving his physical strength; the foundation of his physical body, his natural talent... also seemed to be growing more profound under the infusion of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill.

_Although on the first layer of Kunxu, the Ten Great Sects stipulate that no one can truly begin cultivating until high school—otherwise it's illegal cultivation punishable by death._

_But those rich people aren't like the original Zhang Yu, who lived in poverty until his first year of high school._

Zhang Yu now knew that the wealthy in Songyang City began training from a young age; although they didn't truly start cultivating, they underwent modification surgeries, took medicinal supplements, used dietary supplements, and various other methods to enhance their potential and foundation before high school.

Even someone like Zhao Tianxing, whose family was far less wealthy, Zhang Yu had heard him say that his parents had been feeding him various supplements since elementary school.

It could be said that the vast majority of students at Songyang High School were not like the original Zhang Yu, who went into high school cultivation with a completely natural and untouched body.

Zhang Yu guessed inwardly, _Perhaps it's precisely this gap that led to the original's insufficient drug resistance, which is why taking the enhancers caused problems with his internal organs._

And now, after cultivating the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi during this period, especially after taking the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill for training, Zhang Yu felt that his entire body of flesh and blood, from his internal organs to his marrow and bones, was gradually beginning to possess a fundamental strength.

It was no longer just about getting stronger through attrition, like when he practiced the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms in the past.

Instead, under the scouring of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi combined with the medicinal power of the pill, he felt his internal qi and blood becoming more vigorous, his digestive ability growing stronger, his metabolism increasing, and even the hidden waste and toxins within his organs being gradually expelled.

_If I continue to strengthen my foundation like this, my body's potential will be greater, and it will be easier to increase my physical strength in the future._

_Especially with my internal organs feeling more and more comfortable... if this continues, I should be able to take more body tempering enhancers for cultivation in the future, right?_

Just then, his phone rang. Zhang Yu answered and saw it was a call from Song Hailong.

Song Hailong said, "Zhang Yu, I'm calling to inform you and Bai Zhenzhen that the future training sessions are canceled."

"Huh?" Zhang Yu said, surprised. "Are you sure?"

Song Hailong said, "Thank you for your hard work during this time. You've helped me improve a lot in ground-based combat."

"But you should have felt it too. My physical strength is improving faster and faster. You won't be able to keep up."

Zhang Yu thought to himself that he could now take Crimson Marrow Primordial Pills continuously and that his physical strength would definitely be able to keep up with Song Hailong's in the future. He was just about to persuade the other party to continue paying for lessons.

But then he heard Song Hailong continue, "You are excellent, but I've found an even more excellent combat practice partner. And my time is very limited, so I can only terminate our collaboration."

Zhang Yu asked curiously, "Who is it?"

He wanted to see who was stealing his business.

Song Hailong gritted his teeth and said, "Yu Xinghan."

Listening to Song Hailong's voice, Zhang Yu could almost picture the other's ferocious expression, veins bulging on his forehead.

Song Hailong continued, "He was first in the first-year class in the recent monthly exam."

"Heh," Song Hailong laughed sarcastically. "He needed to find a sparring partner and thought I was the most suitable in White Dragon's first year, so he hired me as his combat sparring partner for ten thousand an hour."

"I don't care about the money, but challenging this guy every day and surpassing him step by step—that really suits me."

"Alright, that's all. You should cultivate hard too. Don't let me not even see you at the sports competition..."

Hearing Song Hailong's words, Zhang Yu could only suppress his original intention to persuade him.

What else could he say?

Good grief, his own client had now become someone else's employee. Someone stronger than him was paying to fight Song Hailong; how could he possibly compete with that?

Zhang Yu could only hang up the phone silently and relay the tragic news to Bai Zhenzhen.

Bai Zhenzhen sighed upon hearing it. "Damn, our income has dropped again. It seems tutoring for the Dark Learning Gang is unavoidable now. I'll prepare a bit more, and we'll go in two days."

Bai Zhenzhen thought about how she and Zhang Yu were doing gang business, fighting for a tutoring fee of a few thousand an hour.

Meanwhile, Song Hailong could earn 10,000 an hour while challenging a strong opponent and training in combat.

Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but lament, "Damn it, how do these rich people make money so easily?"

...

Another two days passed.

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen met at the agreed-upon subway station.

Under the circulation of his Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, Zhang Yu had once again transformed into the image of Teacher Ma.

And as he looked at the girl before him—who, after taking off her mask, had a face, arms, and neck covered in tattoos and a head of long golden hair—he had to check his phone to confirm that it was Bai Zhenzhen.

_What the hell? How did Zhen become a rune warrior? Some kind of punk?_

Seeing Zhang Yu's surprised look, Bai Zhenzhen said with a face full of disdain, "Didn't you say we needed a disguise? You have your Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi to change your shape, so I can only use some tattoo stickers, a wig, and padding to change my appearance. I'll wash it off when I get home."

"With a mask on like this, no one should be able to recognize me, right?"

"And I don't look like a high school student now, do I? Otherwise, how would I get through the interview?"

Only then did Zhang Yu's gaze shift from the tattoos on Bai Zhenzhen's body to her chest, butt, and shoes.

He thought to himself, _So she's wearing padding? No wonder her figure looks a size bigger. Paired with the tattoos and wig, she really doesn't look like a high school student at all._

But thinking about the interview for the tutoring position today, Zhang Yu subconsciously said, "With so many tattoos, will there be a problem with the interview for a tutoring position?"

Bai Zhenzhen, however, retorted, "What kind of damn gang interview would disqualify someone for tattoos!"

"Besides, I think this style is exactly what the Dark Learning Gang is looking for. Look at the words I've stuck on; don't they show my determination to be an illegal tutor?"

Zhang Yu looked at the phrases 'The Sea of Classes is Boundless' and 'Attend Class Every Day' on her face, along with tattoos of desks, chairs, classrooms, and blackboards, and suddenly felt that this was indeed the style he had seen at the Dark Learning Gang.

The doll commented, "With my many years of experience in the underworld, her tattoos are definitely a plus for the interview. At least from the outside, she looks more like a member of the Dark Learning Gang than you do, giving off the vibe of a high school teacher who fell into massive debt and was forced to sell lessons."

"Alright then," Zhang Yu nodded, leading the re-masked Bai Zhenzhen towards the Dark Learning Gang's campus.

However, because he was with Bai Zhenzhen this time, Zhang Yu first took the subway.

After getting off the subway and thinking about the considerable distance remaining, Zhang Yu said, "There's still a long way to go. I can carry you."

# Chapter 96: What Got In?

"No need, my running speed isn't slow," Bai Zhenzhen said, waving her hand and starting to warm up, her long, slender thighs continuously tensing and relaxing, displaying curves honed by long-term training.

"My Sports Car Legs is already level 10."

Then, to Bai Zhenzhen's astonishment, a roar of mana suddenly erupted from within Zhang Yu's body. The next moment, he shot out several dozen meters, then zipped back in front of her with a gust of wind.

"My movement technique has now reached the level of a first-class delivery driver."

What does it feel like to see your good buddy suddenly have level 10 Sports Car Legs, running faster than an electric scooter?

Bai Zhenzhen's first feeling was, of course, surprise.

_I've never seen Yu-boy practice Sports Car Legs! Is he secretly delivering food every night?_

Her second feeling was like seeing a buddy buy a new car; she thought, your ride is so fast, can you give me a ride?

Bai Zhenzhen suddenly leaped onto Zhang Yu's back, her arms wrapped around his neck and her legs clamped around his waist as she said, "Yu-boy, take me for a spin!"

In the next instant, Zhang Yu was already carrying Bai Zhenzhen as he shot off like an electric current, rushing towards the Dark Learning Gang's campus amidst the whistling wind.

Bai Zhenzhen rested her face against Zhang Yu's back, watching the surrounding streetscape fly past, and said with some excitement, "A'Yu, you're so fast."

"Am I?"

Although Zhang Yu had mastered many level 10 cultivation techniques, he had never dared to show them off easily.

Now, having a rare chance to show off his level 10 Sports Car Legs in front of Zhen, Zhang Yu's mood became unusually cheerful.

Amidst the howling wind, Zhang Yu chuckled and said, "This isn't even my full speed."

"Really? A'Yu, you're amazing!"

"Heh heh, look, am I faster now!"

"So fast, so fast! A'Yu, can you go even faster?"

"Haha, watch me accelerate again!"

With a loud bang, Zhang Yu activated Elevator Leap and flew across the traffic light ahead in a single bound.

Bai Zhenzhen smoothed down her golden wig, which was flying up and down in the wild wind, and watched Zhang Yu run faster and faster amidst her praise, thinking to herself, _Riding a buddy is really exhilarating. No wonder so many people would rather hit a person than hail a cab._

Leaning against Zhang Yu's back, feeling the rolling heat of qi and blood coming from his body, Bai Zhenzhen thought, _It's just that I can't turn off this heater. I feel like my whole body is being cooked..._

The next moment, with a light splash, a puddle of water exploded under Zhang Yu's foot, drenching Bai Zhenzhen's leg.

"Zhang Yu, are you trying to kill me! Why did you step in a filthy gutter!"

Zhang Yu said helplessly, "This stretch of road in the suburbs often has no streetlights, I can't see clearly. Help me out with your phone's flashlight."

Bai Zhenzhen took out her phone and turned on the light to illuminate the road ahead for Zhang Yu.

On the dark path, the two of them pressed forward under the illumination of the faint light, moving farther and farther away from the neon city behind them.

Zhang Yu suddenly exclaimed, "Why is there something hard pressing against me from down there?"

For a rare moment, Bai Zhenzhen's face turned red as she said irritably, "That's the spiritual root!"

"It's all because you wanted to borrow it to play with. I've been trying it out recently, which has caused this spiritual root to keep poking me in the stomach."

Zhang Yu suddenly remembered something. "Right, don't forget to request a concealment talisman."

Seeing the constantly bobbing Bai Zhenzhen and the tattoos all over her face on the screen, Zhang Pianpian asked in confusion, "What are you doing?"

"Godmother, Zhang Yu is carrying me to the Dark Learning Gang campus. I'd like to ask you to cast a concealment talisman for me."

After a moment of silence, Zhang Pianpian said, "It's very good that you two can earn money by tutoring at a gang as a work-study program. But you two... are you planning to come to me every day from now on to have me cast concealment talismans on both of you?"

As she spoke, Zhang Pianpian asked again, "Doesn't Zhang Yu have the Talisman Tome? Hasn't he learned the concealment talisman yet?"

Zhang Yu took the phone and said while running, "I've just started tutoring to earn money, so funds are still a bit tight. I'll be able to afford to learn the concealment talisman after a while."

"But I still don't know how to draw talismans remotely, so Zhen will still need your help, sis."

Zhang Pianpian said flatly, "Why don’t you two just live together?"

"Find a place to rent together between the Dark Learning Gang and Songyang High School. You can save on rent, it'll be convenient for school and work, and the two of you can share the Talisman Tome to cast talismans."

Zhang Yu's mind immediately started calculating the time and cost, and his eyes lit up. He realized that this was indeed a very cost-effective solution that could save a lot of money.

There was just one problem. Zhang Yu asked Bai Zhenzhen, "Zhen, do you rent your place?"

Bai Zhenzhen nodded. "Duh. If my family could still afford to buy a house, how would we have the money to support my cultivation?"

Bai Zhenzhen then continued, "Godmother has a point. If I can get a class at the Dark Learning Gang, let's rent together. It's indeed more cost-effective. My parents are working out of town anyway, so I've always lived alone."

In the blink of an eye, the two arrived at the Dark Learning Gang's campus.

Bai Zhenzhen was introduced to Black Crow by Zhang Yu to attend her interview, while Zhang Yu went to his own class.

Walking into the classroom, his eyes were met with rows of muscular men sitting in their seats. They were burly, with dark skin and faces that showed a weather-beaten weariness.

These were the students who came for the Excavator Palm course. Almost all of them were from construction sites, hoping to be more competitive in their job search, which was why they came to learn and improve their Excavator Palm.

Zhang Yu heard that as more and more high school students graduated each year, the competition for jobs on construction sites was becoming increasingly fierce. The recruitment requirements for positions related to the Excavator Palm... had been raised to level 6 or above just to get an interview.

Through a few days of teaching and casual chats during breaks, Zhang Yu had also gotten to know his students, who had an average height of 2 meters and an average weight of over 200 kg.

Some students had very large, round bellies like big rubber balls; Zhang Yu knew this was from undergoing gastrointestinal modification surgery, allowing them to survive on grass alone.

Some students had very large, dark, and round pupils; this was to compete for night-time construction site jobs, for which they had undergone night vision surgery.

Most of them had flushed faces, rapid breathing, and optimistic but low-IQ personalities—a side effect of long-term use of inferior stimulants at work.

It was said that when Purple Cloud Company found out, they had wanted to improve this defect in the stimulant, but it was kept because the drug was too popular on the market.

There was even a construction site that secretly put this stimulant in the employees' drinking water, claiming that it could improve work efficiency while effectively preventing employees from running away and avoiding wage arrears. Although the supervisor in charge was fired and bankrupted, it was still cited by many companies as a classic case study in corporate management.

At this moment, as Zhang Yu walked into the classroom, many students were still talking loudly.

Some were complaining about the price increase of synthetic food. After all, the synthetic food they used to eat was disgusting, but at least it was cheap.

Some were discussing going to other cities to work. It was said that the corporate wars in the north had triggered a new wave of infrastructure boom, a place where everything was waiting to be rebuilt, jobs were easy to find, overtime was easy to get approved, and rent was free. It was a good place where everyone had a job and a place to live.

Others were excitedly talking about the high wages at the Oasis Tower construction site, saying that the Oasis Tower was going to be built to 1,111 floors, becoming the new tallest building in Songyang City, which caught the attention of a group of students around them.

But with a cough from Zhang Yu, most of the students in the classroom fell silent. Zhang Yu didn't mind the few who were still talking foolishly.

Zhang Yu didn't blame them. They weren't stupid; their intelligence had just been worn down by work.

"Alright, be quiet, class is starting. Otherwise, if I have to wait for you to quiet down, the time missed will not be refunded."

Zhang Yu knew that for these students from construction sites, money was the most effective motivator. After all, apart from their spending on Dao heart buffers, most of them were extremely frugal.

As expected, the moment he mentioned this, the room immediately fell silent, with only the sound of Zhang Yu's lecture spreading through the air.

The quality of Zhang Yu's lectures was naturally beyond question. Especially considering that these students' intelligence had been worn down by work, he explained things in an even more simple and easy-to-understand manner. Combined with his deep understanding of muscles and sinews, the students gained a lot after each class.

After class, Zhang Yu went outside the small building and saw Bai Zhenzhen practicing her techniques while waiting for him.

Seeing Zhang Yu appear, Bai Zhenzhen said with a smile, "The teachers available for trial lessons happened to be here today, so they gave me a trial lesson. I can start teaching tomorrow. They're paying me 2,000 per class."

Although the pay was much less than Zhang Yu's, Bai Zhenzhen was still very excited. After all, this was a long-term part-time job, and it was the highest-paying long-term meal ticket she had ever had in her life.

Zhang Yu was also happy to hear this. If Zhen could earn more money, her chances of improving her physical strength and participating in the sports competition would be greater.

On the way back, Zhang Yu once again carried Bai Zhenzhen as they ran.

Bai Zhenzhen had one arm around Zhang Yu's neck and was holding her phone in the other, searching for rental information while leaning against his back.

She frowned and said, "It's hard to find a place that meets the requirements."

Zhang Yu asked curiously, "What are your requirements?"

Bai Zhenzhen listed them one by one, "First, it has to be small and cheap enough. After all, the place is just for storing things, and we won't be spending much time there."

"Second, it must at least have electricity and internet, otherwise it's too inconvenient."

"It would be best if it's a basement, so it would be convenient for training without worrying about disturbing the people downstairs..."

"Damn it, these good places are too popular, it's so hard to find one."

Just then, the sky had unknowingly started to brighten. The sun gradually rose from the direction of downtown Songyang City, illuminating the road ahead for Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

"It's already dawn without us realizing... right, today's tutoring session was later."

Mortals also began to appear one after another on the roadside in the suburbs.

Zhang Yu saw the long lines in front of the stalls distributing synthetic food, and memories from this body's past also surfaced in his mind.

His and Bai Zhenzhen's figures flashed past the eyes of these mortals like a gust of wind, stirring a trace of envy in their eyes.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _If the original Zhang Yu hadn't been admitted to high school, he would probably be like these people now, or like his former middle school classmates, living day by day receiving relief food and doing low-income mortal jobs, just waiting to die, right?_

But as the images of mortals lining up for food flashed through his mind, he suddenly recalled the students in his class today, and for a moment, he couldn't tell which group—these middle schoolers or those high school graduates from his class—was happier.

Bai Zhenzhen's focus was still on finding a house, her mind occupied with what kind of requirements the house should have if she were to live and eat with Zhang Yu, go to school and work together in the future.

As she was constantly thinking about these things, she suddenly felt a sense of emptiness in her lower abdomen.

Bai Zhenzhen was suddenly shocked. _What the hell! My spiritual root is gone!_

At the same time, Zhang Yu, who was carrying Bai Zhenzhen and running at high speed, was also startled. _What the hell! What just drilled into me from behind?_

# Chapter 97: Borrowing Zhen's Spiritual Root

Zhang Yu only felt a chill on his lower back as something drilled into his dantian's sea of qi and then began to take root and sprout.

Zhang Yu was no stranger to renting spiritual roots; almost the instant he felt the change in his dantian, he thought of a spiritual root.

_How did a spiritual root suddenly appear in my dantian?_

Immediately after, he felt... that after the spiritual root rapidly took root and sprouted, it spread throughout his entire body, covering every inch of his flesh and blood like a nervous system, as if it had always been a part of his body.

Even as his Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method performed its passive breathing exercise, these spiritual roots that had spread throughout his body also inhaled and exhaled with it, quickly drawing the spiritual energy from the air to surge towards him.

"Hiss!"

Like sweet rain after a long drought, as streams of spiritual energy poured into his body, Zhang Yu felt every fiber of his being desperately crave the incoming spiritual energy.

After all, for Zhang Yu, who was cultivating without a spiritual root, his body was in a state of spiritual energy deprivation most of the time.

Now that spiritual energy was suddenly pouring in from all over his body, Zhang Yu immediately felt a sense of comfort throughout his entire being, and the operation of his level 10 Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method became even more turbulent, stirring the surrounding spiritual energy to swarm towards him.

And this state of Zhang Yu's immediately caught Bai Zhenzhen's attention.

Especially since she could faintly sense that her spiritual root was currently inside Zhang Yu's body.

_My spiritual root went into Yu-boy's stomach?_

A trace of surprise appeared in Bai Zhenzhen's heart.

_What's going on? I wanted to lend it to Yu-boy to play with, but that was supposed to be after he got on his knees and begged me like 'Mom, please!' Why did you, spiritual root, run over on your own?_

Thinking of this, Bai Zhenzhen felt a surge of annoyance. She reached out and fumbled around Zhang Yu's stomach, trying to pull her spiritual root back out.

Feeling Bai Zhenzhen's hand groping his lower abdomen, sending waves of ticklish sensations, Zhang Yu quickly said, "What are you doing, Zhen! Stop groping! We're going to have a traffic accident! We can't afford to pay if we kill someone!"

Zhang Yu came to a halt, his Sports Car Legs decelerating rapidly, finally stopping by the roadside as he set Bai Zhenzhen down.

Having failed to retrieve her spiritual root, Bai Zhenzhen said unwillingly, "Did my spiritual root run into your stomach?"

Zhang Yu subconsciously touched his stomach and said, "This is your spiritual root?"

_Didn't that evil god say... this is Zhen's own spiritual root, not a rented one? How can it end up in my stomach?_

The doll, disguised as a prayer bead, was also astonished at this moment. _This woman's spiritual root can be transferred?_

Bai Zhenzhen naturally didn't know the thoughts in Zhang Yu's mind. After all, from her perspective, Zhang Yu shouldn't know the secret of her spiritual root yet.

And now that her spiritual root had already drilled into his body, Bai Zhenzhen decided to stop being secretive.

She nodded directly and then said through gritted teeth, "This is the spiritual root I've nurtured for over a decade. Does it feel good to use?"

Zhang Yu wanted to say that it did indeed feel great, but seeing Bai Zhenzhen's angry expression, he refrained from saying it.

He just touched his stomach and asked curiously, "Why did your spiritual root come to me?"

"Actually, I've had a spiritual root in my stomach since I was a child," Bai Zhenzhen sighed, then continued, "This thing is different from ordinary spiritual roots; it seems to grow along with me."

"In the last two years, it has even started to adapt and grow in different directions according to the thoughts in my mind."

"Like when you mentioned borrowing a spiritual root last time, I was wondering if it was possible."

"And today, this damned thing just drilled into your stomach on its own!"

Hearing Bai Zhenzhen's words, Zhang Yu's face couldn't help but show a look of shock. _No way... there's such an outrageous spiritual root?_

But the mention of the spiritual root jumping into Zhang Yu's stomach infuriated Bai Zhenzhen, and she reached out to grope his stomach again.

Then, a look of contempt appeared on her face as she tutted, "Not being neutered is really a hassle. How can you get a reaction from just a few rubs on the stomach? Do you need some time to take care of it?"

_Don't you damn well know how vigorous my qi and blood are these days before you go groping?_ Zhang Yu suddenly felt like a good friend had barged into his room and seen him with one hand holding a tissue and the other in his pants.

It was also at this moment that Zhang Yu suddenly gained a profound understanding of Songyang High School's sterilization policy.

If they weren't sterilized, a group of hormonal teenagers who worshiped scores and money would be messing around together every day. After three years of high school... wouldn't their scores drop?

Under Bai Zhenzhen's contemptuous gaze, Zhang Yu retreated several steps and said, "Don't be anxious. Think carefully about how the spiritual root got into my stomach just now."

So, after some discussion and research, Bai Zhenzhen had Zhang Yu carry her on his back again.

As Bai Zhenzhen hugged Zhang Yu from behind and repeatedly chanted in her mind for the spiritual root to return, she felt a sudden warmth in her stomach the next moment—her precious spiritual root was back.

And with the return of the spiritual root, a surge of spiritual energy also poured into Bai Zhenzhen's body, drilling into her limbs and bones.

"Hiss!"

She sucked in a cold breath, shocked. _How does it feel like this thing is absorbing spiritual energy more powerfully than before? And it's even gathering in places where I don't usually circulate my mana?_

But soon, the spiritual root seemed to be re-adapting to Bai Zhenzhen's body condition and returned to its usual state.

A thought suddenly occurred to Bai Zhenzhen. _Could it be that after entering Yu-boy's body, it actively adapted to his physique and took on his shape... and that's why the change happened?_

_But it returned to normal after a short while, reverting to my shape... is it because the time it spent in Yu-boy's body was too short?_

Bai Zhenzhen suddenly became curious. _If it stays for a longer time and adapts more to Yu-boy's body... what will happen?_

On the other side, as the spiritual root in his dantian disappeared and the feeling of abundant spiritual energy faded, a trace of disappointment welled up in Zhang Yu's heart.

Just then, he heard Bai Zhenzhen say, "Yu-boy, I'll try passing the spiritual root to you again. Get ready to receive it."

The next moment, Zhang Yu felt the spiritual root return to his body, once again taking root and sprouting in his dantian.

Spiritual energy from the air whistled as it poured into his body, making Zhang Yu feel a sense of fulfillment.

_As expected, a cultivator just needs a spiritual root to feel right._

Although he felt great, Zhang Yu understood that the spiritual root in his stomach was the key for Bai Zhenzhen to become stronger and get into the Ten Greats.

So Zhang Yu suppressed the reluctance in his heart and said, "Alright, Zhen, take this spiritual root back quickly. Don't damage it by moving it in and out."

Hearing this, Bai Zhenzhen replied, "It's fine, leave it with you for a few hours. I have an idea I want to test."

"Huh?" Zhang Yu said with delight. "Then... then I'll lend you my Talisman Tome to play with."

"Give it here!" Bai Zhenzhen reached into Zhang Yu's robes and snatched the Talisman Tome. "My spiritual root is worth at least several hundred million. This Talisman Tome will be collateral with me for now."

Then she patted Zhang Yu's shoulder and said, "Hurry up and get to school, don't be late and get chewed out by that devil incarnate Su Haifeng."

So, Zhang Yu carried Bai Zhenzhen all the way to school.

On the way, Bai Zhenzhen hugged Zhang Yu, leaning against his back, playing with the Talisman Tome while occasionally telling him about the current functions of the spiritual root.

Zhang Yu suddenly said, "Calling it 'spiritual root' all the time feels like it could get confusing with other spiritual roots in conversation. Shouldn't we give it a name?"

Bai Zhenzhen was slightly taken aback. Since she was a child, she had only thought about hiding the spiritual root. After entering high school, she would never mention the spiritual root in her stomach to anyone.

So, all this time, she had simply called it 'spiritual root' in her mind, since she naturally knew which spiritual root she was referring to.

Hearing what Zhang Yu said now, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but nod slightly.

"Hmm... then what should we call it?"

"This is your spiritual root, so let's call it the Zhenzhen Spiritual Root."

"That's so lame," Bai Zhenzhen pouted. "Let's just call it the True Spiritual Root. By the way, when we get back, we'll tell everyone that I've lent you my rented spiritual root."

Bai Zhenzhen smiled. "Heh heh, that will further solidify the fact that this spiritual root of mine is a rented one."

So, for the rest of the journey, Bai Zhenzhen continued to tell Zhang Yu about the various wonderful uses of the True Spiritual Root.

Concealing the spiritual root, concealing herself, accelerating martial arts cultivation, seeing through flaws in combat, accelerating mana refinement, and the body tempering assistance function she had been using recently.

Zhang Yu's eyes lit up as he listened, wishing he could start ascetic training immediately.

And this entire process, including the conversation between Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, was naturally witnessed and heard by the evil god doll disguised as a prayer bead.

Her evaluation of this was, of course, only... foolish.

_Idiot! Idiot! Zhang Yu is an idiot! With such a heaven-defying spiritual root, you should kill her and take it immediately! I have a hundred damn ways to help you dispose of Bai Zhenzhen's body, I guarantee you won't be discovered._

_With the help of this heaven-defying spiritual root, forget about getting into the Ten Greats, you'd even have a chance at graduate school... no, a Ph.D.!_

_If you don't act now, you might be backstabbed by this woman in the future! How could she possibly tolerate such a huge secret being in someone else's hands forever?_

But seeing Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's trusting appearance, the evil god knew that even if she said it, he wouldn't listen, and it would only increase Zhang Yu's dislike for her.

_Damn it, this is the inherent flaw of the poor, always believing in ephemeral things like friends, feelings, and trust... these things are completely useless, they only hinder you from making money!_

_Money! Only money is the most important thing!_

After returning to school, apart from the general knowledge courses for all three years of high school that he had already mastered, like Chinese and Math, Zhang Yu simply skipped his mana and combat classes as well.

The mana teacher, Teacher Yan, and the combat teacher, Teacher Lei, were old acquaintances of Zhang Yu's and knew his level in mana control and martial combat. The first-year courses were indeed of little help to Zhang Yu, so they both approved his absence.

In this way, in addition to the physical education class he was already skipping, Zhang Yu could surprisingly use more than half of his school day for free ascetic training.
