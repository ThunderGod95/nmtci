# Chapter 106: Zhang Yu, Level 4.95

"What is wrong with you?"

That was what Zhang Yu had wanted to say in response to Le Mulan's attempt to throw money at him.

But before the words could leave his mouth, Bai Zhenzhen nudged him in the shoulder. "She's offering money! What are you waiting for?"

Bai Zhenzhen then turned to Le Mulan. "Where do you want to touch? Taking off his shirt will cost extra."

Le Mulan shook her head repeatedly. "No need, just… just a touch of the hand will be fine."

Just then, Le Mulan trembled slightly. She frowned, patting the stool beneath her. "Don't move."

The girl lying prone under Le Mulan gritted her teeth and stopped moving, her face contorting as if her eyes and nose were being scrunched together. In her heart, she felt like crying tears of blood.

_Why? Why would someone so rich, so brilliant, so noble as the top student in the grade, spend money on a poor, dirty student from Songyang High School?_

Once the stool beneath her was still, Le Mulan looked at Zhang Yu again and slowly extended her hand.

Suddenly, Bai Zhenzhen pressed down on her palm. "Hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? You haven't paid yet."

And so, after Le Mulan transferred 2,000 yuan, Zhang Yu felt a small, cold hand slowly reach for his.

It started with a tentative touch to his fingertips, then he felt the hand slide like a snake along his fingers to the back of his hand, where it rested gently.

_It's like a block of ice…_ The thought had barely crossed Zhang Yu's mind when Le Mulan quickly pulled her hand back.

She nodded, exhaling softly. "That's enough."

Bai Zhenzhen watched her with curiosity. "All done? Want to touch me? I can give you a discount."

The corners of Le Mulan's normally cold lips curled up slightly as she shook her head in satisfaction. "Not today, but maybe next time."

"When that time comes, could I pay you both to touch you at the same time?"

After receiving an affirmative answer, the arc of Le Mulan's lips widened, and she departed with Lian Tianji.

Watching the 'stool' also get up and walk away, Zhang Yu was speechless. "Is Le Mulan sick or something?"

"What's wrong with an easy chance to make money?" Bai Zhenzhen said.

Zhang Yu was still puzzled. "But why did she want to touch us?"

Bai Zhenzhen shrugged. "Who knows? Maybe it's some kind of heart art? Rich people have all sorts of bizarre heart arts."

After finishing their meal at the buffet, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen made their way to the spectator stands. They planned to use a Heaven's Eye Talisman to gather some intelligence on the three major high schools before the competition began.

As for their concealment talismans, they had naturally activated those long before setting foot inside Purple Cloud High School.

But the next moment, as he activated the Heaven's Eye Talisman, Zhang Yu stared, momentarily stunned at the sight before him.

In the direction of the White Dragon High School contingent, the same line of text floated above every competitor's head: Immortal Resonance Group Company Data.

Over at the Red Pagoda High School area, several students with dark complexions had another message: For business inquiries, please contact Red Pagoda Husbandry.

Zhang Yu quickly glanced toward the Purple Cloud High School team and saw text materializing over the heads of Le Mulan, Lian Tianji, and the others: Purple Cloud Supplements Non-Public Information. Legal action will be pursued for any forced viewing.

Zhang Yu sighed faintly. "Their information is all hidden."

"The companies behind the three major high schools—Immortal Resonance, Red Pagoda, and Purple Cloud—are really taking this competition seriously."

…

In the audience.

Lan Ling stared down at the bustling competition grounds.

"Why did you drag me here?" he asked coldly. "To watch our school's team get annihilated?"

Beside him, Zhou Chechen chuckled. "Lan Ling, don't confine your vision to a single high school or a single competition."

"I brought you here today to witness a new body tempering revolution in Songyang City."

Lan Ling frowned. "What are you trying to do? Why didn't you participate in the athletics meet two weeks ago? Did you already know about Oasis Group's partnership with them?"

Zhou Chechen smiled faintly. "Lan Ling, the three major high schools gave us a spot—a spot to receive their technical support in body tempering and compete for a place among the Ten Greats."

"This year, you will give that spot to me."

"Next year, during our third year, I will give you my full support to seize that spot."

"If you agree, then from this day forward, we will be the last two students from Songyang High School to enter the Ten Greats."

"If you refuse, then for the next year, I will do nothing but beat you every single day. I guarantee you won't graduate."

…

In the Spirit Realm.

Having taken a rare half-day off, Mo Tianyi felt a profound sense of weakness, a wave of guilt for not working washing over him.

Watching the competition at Purple Cloud High School via a live stream, he couldn't help but ask, "Boss, is this competition really that important? Important enough to watch live?"

A blurry figure beside him nodded. "Very important. It could even affect the entire power structure of Songyang's sixteen families."

_The sixteen families of Songyang…_ Mo Tianyi knew these were the sixteen wealthiest and most powerful families in the city.

Their members not only intermarried but were also deeply embedded within the Songyang branches of major corporations, acting as local dragons who helped the large companies manage the region and control an immense amount of resources.

The 'Boss' watched the live feed. "The athletics meet usually starts with a physical strength assessment, followed by tests of agility, speed, and power—four events in total. The final scores are then calculated…"

Here, his voice trailed off. "It's starting. They're about to test the competitors' physical strength. Let's see just how far the technological breakthroughs of the three major high schools have come."

On the large screen at the venue, names and scores flickered into view as contestant after contestant completed the test.

However, only the top ten scores remained displayed on the screen.

Currently occupying the top spot was… Chu Qiuhe of White Dragon High School, with a level of 4.49.

…

Just before the physical strength test began.

At the highest point of the stands, at the very back of the crowd, a boy in a Purple Cloud High School uniform was also watching the competition grounds.

The young man bore a slight resemblance to Le Mulan; at first glance, he could almost be mistaken for a girl. This was especially true given his height of just under two meters, which made him appear even more delicate at Purple Cloud High School, where everyone was physically imposing.

Only the incredibly complex, purple, vertical-pupil marking between his brows hinted at his extraordinary nature.

At that moment, another man—this one with bronze skin, standing about two and a half meters tall, and holding a phone for a live stream—approached the Purple Cloud student, laughing as he walked.

"Everyone, look who it is! My good brother, the top student of Purple Cloud High School's second year, Le Jingchen, who is also the vice president of the Student Council."

The live-streaming giant squeezed in next to Le Jingchen, fitting both of them into the frame.

Feeling the man's proximity, Le Jingchen's muscles tensed for an instant before relaxing again. He smiled and waved at the live stream audience.

Though he disliked the man's closeness, Le Jingchen knew that this body tempering influencer, known as 'Gang Shan,' had over eight million followers. He was a representative figure of traditional body tempering in Songyang City, famous for his insistence on using only alchemical enhancers and no surgery.

And Gang Shan's signature was that he never wore anything but shorts, so as to display his meticulously honed muscles to the world.

The reason he was here live-streaming a first-year athletics competition was, naturally, at the invitation of a corporation.

_So what if he's a representative of traditional body tempering,_ Le Jingchen thought. _If the price is right, he still has to come and promote the new technology._

He even knew that his current encounter with the man, and their subsequent joint broadcast, were all orchestrated by Purple Cloud Supplements.

_Today's athletics competition… the clash of students and technologies on the field is one thing._

_The war of public opinion off the field is a whole other battle._

_Hmph, I wonder how many people will jump out today to pull stunts for attention._

Just then, the influencer, Gang Shan, spoke up.

"Jingchen, what are your thoughts on today's competition?"

Le Jingchen offered a faint smile. "Just like the second-year athletics meet two weeks ago, it's primarily a contest between the three major high schools. After all, the recent breakthroughs in body tempering have only been applied to their students…"

Following the pre-arranged plan, Le Jingchen began to promote the new technology in a seemingly objective and neutral manner, dropping hints here and there.

After they had chatted for a while, Gang Shan looked toward the competition floor.

"Oh, the competition has officially begun. First up is the physical strength test. This round is scored based on physical strength, with a maximum of 50 points, correct?"

"Then the second event tests agility, for a total of 75 points. The third event is speed, also for 75 points, and the final power event is worth a total of 150."

"The final ranking of the athletics competition is calculated from the total score of these four events."

Gang Shan first explained the scoring system to his viewers.

Then, to give his audience a more intuitive understanding of the revolutionary nature of the new body tempering technology, Gang Shan provided some context.

"It's been about eight and a half months since the school year started for these first-years."

"The average physical strength for most ordinary high schools at this point is around level 1.0."

"Key high schools are a bit better. Their students' average level can reach close to 2.0 by now."

"Of course, among the key high schools, Songyang High is particularly strong in athletics, so they'd be much higher. A few of their top students might even have a chance to challenge the powerhouses from the three major high schools."

"As for Songyang City's three major high schools, they are in a league of their own. Based on previous years' data, their students' average level can approach 3.0, and the absolute top students might even break through level 4.0."

Meanwhile, as the physical tests began, the contestants' physical strength levels flashed across the big screen one after another.

Very quickly, the score in first place stunned countless people in the audience, as well as the many netizens watching the live stream.

White Dragon High School, Chu Qiuhe, 4.49.

Gang Shan was astonished. "Level 4.49? To reach this level in just eight and a half months? This Chu Qiuhe must be White Dragon High School's ace, right?"

Beside him, Le Jingchen smiled faintly. "He's hardly an ace. The strongest in this year's class at White Dragon High should be Yu Xinghan and Song Hailong."

Gang Shan replied, "Level 4.49 isn't even considered an ace?"

Le Jingchen explained, "That's because the body tempering technologies of all three major high schools have had a breakthrough. You can tell from Chu Qiuhe's appearance that he's undergone modification surgery. This allows his body to mimic the muscular structure of a demonic beast, shattering his original limitations and achieving explosive growth."

Gang Shan said, "But modification surgery still has its risks, doesn't it? And many people find the physical changes difficult to accept."

Le Jingchen nodded. "This kind of surgery that directly alters the body is certainly very risky. In contrast, Purple Cloud's super-metabolism surgery is much simpler, with lower risk and higher efficiency…"

As Le Jingchen was introducing the technological advancements of Purple Cloud Supplements, as if to prove his point, the big screen changed. The first-place spot now read: Purple Cloud High School, Lian Tianji, 4.56.

Gang Shan was amazed. "This level of physical strength is already higher than any first-year champion from previous years, isn't it?"

Le Jingchen nodded slightly. "With the breakthrough in body tempering technology, the first-year athletics records are bound to be broken time and time again. The difference between contestants who have used the new technology and those who haven't will be like the difference between heaven and earth, like modern people versus ancient ones…"

Just as Le Jingchen was expounding on the importance of the new body tempering technology, the name at the top of the big screen changed once more.

Songyang High School, Zhang Yu, 4.95.

---

# Chapter 107: Physical Strength Ranking

The strongest is White Dragon High School?

Red Pagoda High School is certainly formidable as well.

If it were Purple Cloud High School, that wouldn't be impossible either.

What the hell? What is Songyang High School?

Songyang High School, Zhang Yu, 4.95?

The sudden appearance of Zhang Yu's score left countless people utterly stunned.

The students from the three major high schools were the most shocked of all.

Only because they had undergone modifications with the new body tempering technology did they truly understand the chasm between their former and current selves.

Chu Qiuhe stared intently at the "4.95" on the screen. It was a terrifying score, one that made him feel an impulse to fall to his knees, and a score that a student from Songyang High School should never have been able to achieve.

His pair of rhinoceros-like ears twitched rapidly. "How did he do it? Did Purple Cloud or Red Pagoda help him? But he shows no physical signs of their new technologies."

"Could it be…"

Chu Qiuhe subconsciously glanced in Yu Xinghan's direction.

If there was a single competitor among the three major high schools who showed no signs of any new technology, it was this disciple of a Golden Core master.

"Did Zhang Yu receive our White Dragon High School's body tempering technology? And has he already achieved the same level of physical control as Yu Xinghan?"

"Is… is that even possible?"

Chu Qiuhe shook his head, dismissing the guess. Neither the Immortal Resonance Group nor the Oasis Group had any such plans, and it was even more impossible for Zhang Yu to possess an aptitude that could rival Yu Xinghan's.

So, after eliminating all other possibilities, Chu Qiuhe arrived at the only remaining one: "Songyang High School's body tempering technology has also had a breakthrough?"

…

On the other side.

In the Purple Cloud High School rest area, Lian Tianji gazed at the score on the big screen and lamented internally, "He wasn't lying? His physical strength is really level 4.95?"

If someone like that came to Purple Cloud High School, he would be another powerhouse capable of using him as a stool.

"How did he do it? Which company is backing him?"

"Could it be… Songyang High School has also mastered a new body tempering technology?"

Lian Tianji's gaze suddenly shifted to Le Mulan beside him. _The venerable number one has been keeping an eye on Zhang Yu for a while. Did she see how extraordinary he was from the start? As expected of the top student in our grade; her intelligence network and judgment of character are far superior to mine._

…

Meanwhile.

In the Songyang High School rest area.

He Dayou, who had just completed his own physical strength test, shot to his feet, staring in disbelief at Zhang Yu's score.

"4.95?!"

The score wasn't just high; in He Dayou's eyes, it was absurdly high. He suspected that 4.95 might very well be the highest physical strength level among all the competitors in the entire event.

He looked at Zhang Yu, his face a mask of envy and jealousy, and thought, _Could Zhang Pianpian have secretly supported Zhang Yu with White Dragon High School's technology?_

_Even if she didn't, she must have poured an insane amount of money into him._

_What exactly is the relationship between Zhang Yu and Zhang Pianpian? A mother investing in her son… no, even a daughter paying off her father's debts wouldn't throw money around this recklessly!_

Wang Hai, who was also in the Songyang High rest area watching the competition, was equally stunned. "What just happened?"

In the next few moments, his phone rang several times in succession.

He found himself explaining to the school's leadership on the other end of the line, "No, I really don't know anything about a new technology."

"Zhang Yu hardly ever trained with me."

"I have no idea how he got his level to 4.95."

…

In the stands.

Lan Ling stared at the score, both shocked and furious. He turned to Zhou Chechen.

"How could that poor bastard Zhang Yu get this far? Did he undergo White Dragon's surgery?"

Zhou Chechen frowned. "I haven't heard anything about that, but…"

Thinking about the timing of Oasis Group's arrival in Songyang City, recalling Zhang Pianpian's investment in Zhang Yu, and then considering Zhang Yu's almost unbelievable improvement in physical strength…

Zhou Chechen's expression slowly darkened. "Could it be that Zhang Pianpian knew all along about the Oasis Group partnership and the coming breakthroughs in the three major high schools' body tempering technology? Is that why she set things up on Songyang's side?"

"But what is her objective?"

Zhou Chechen couldn't figure it out at the moment, but that didn't stop the sight of Zhang Yu on the field from becoming increasingly irritating.

He took a deep breath. "Whatever her goal is, it's already mid-April. In less than two months, Zhang Pianpian has the college entrance exams, and then university interviews…"

…

At the back of the stands.

One moment, Le Jingchen had been introducing Purple Cloud High School's super-metabolism surgery. The next, Zhang Yu's score of 4.95 left him momentarily speechless.

However, as a professional influencer, Gang Shan reacted quickly. "This student from Songyang High School must have used a new body tempering technology as well, right?"

Le Jingchen nodded decisively. "Without a doubt. Without using the latest body tempering technology, it's impossible to reach a physical strength of 4.95 at this stage of the first year just by relying on alchemical enhancers and acupuncture."

"This student from Songyang High has definitely used some new technology, and his body has been modified."

Seeing that Zhang Yu's skin was neither dark nor purplish, and that he displayed no demonic beast characteristics, Le Jingchen guessed internally, _Has Songyang High also mastered some new technology?_

Le Jingchen didn't jump to conclusions, deciding instead to carefully observe the performance of the other Songyang High students.

Just then, Gang Shan sighed. "This wave of developments in new body tempering technology is truly astonishing. Even a student from Songyang High has reached a level that far surpasses previous champions."

Le Jingchen set aside his thoughts and chimed in, "That's the nature of progress in the Immortal Dao. It always benefits society, allowing more and more people to walk further down the path of cultivation."

Gang Shan asked curiously, "A physical strength of 4.95 is terrifying for a first-year. There can't be anyone here with a higher score, can there?"

Le Jingchen shook his head with a chuckle. "4.95 is indeed impressive, but it's still a bit lacking compared to the top students from the three major high schools who have been enhanced with the latest body tempering technologies."

Shortly after Le Jingchen spoke, a terrifying dragon's roar echoed from the competition floor, causing countless spectators' faces to pale and their hearts to race as an instinctual fear washed over them.

And the name at the top of the big screen had changed again.

Red Pagoda High School, Hu Yuntao, 4.98.

But before the crowd could fully express their amazement at Hu Yuntao's score, another, deeper and more majestic beastly roar resounded, pushing him down to second place.

White Dragon High School, Song Hailong, 5.03.

Gang Shan exclaimed, "School has only been in session for just over seven months, and his physical strength has already broken level 5?"

He shook his head with a wry smile. "The times are truly changing."

As if in response to Gang Shan's remark, the scores on the big screen changed again and again as more students from the three major high schools completed their tests.

The top spot, in particular, was contested fiercely.

Song Hailong had just claimed first place with a 5.03, only to be supplanted moments later by Xiong Wenwu's 5.05.

But Xiong Wenwu's 5.05 didn't hold for long before Yu Xinghan seized the top spot with a 5.07.

Once Yu Xinghan took first place, his position remained unshakable, and the entire top-ten list gradually began to solidify.

But while the vast majority of the audience and staff were captivated by the performance of the top students from the three major high schools, marveling at their ever-increasing physical strength.

Le Jingchen's attention was fixed on the fifth and seventh places.

Fifth Place, Songyang High School, Zhang Yu, 4.95.

Seventh Place, Songyang High School, Bai Zhenzhen, 4.92.

_Songyang High School… they really have mastered a new body tempering technology?_ Le Jingchen thought.

_Hmph… so they deliberately sacrificed the second-year competition to feign weakness, all so they could make a stunning debut at today's first-year competition and promote their new technology?_

_Are they trying to usurp the position of the three major high schools?_

_Heh, quite ambitious. I really underestimated you._

Although he knew the collective strength of the top students from the three major high schools was more than enough to crush the others.

The thought that the latter half of the top ten might be infiltrated by this Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen filled Le Jingchen with a sense of disgust.

It felt like watching a poor person enter Purple Cloud High School without being disinfected, like a pristine tabletop being sullied by a dirty hand.

Just then, Gang Shan asked curiously, "Jingchen, that Le Mulan from Purple Cloud is your sister, right? Her performance seems a little lackluster. What are your thoughts?"

Sixth Place, Purple Cloud High School, Le Mulan, 4.93.

Le Jingchen smiled faintly and explained with composure, "Purple Cloud's super-metabolism technology primarily focuses on enhancing the body's drug resistance. This allows a cultivator to increase their physical strength more easily and rapidly, but it also leads to an issue."

"That is, raw physical strength alone cannot fully represent their true combat potential."

Gang Shan asked, "True combat potential?"

Le Jingchen elaborated, "Naturally, it refers to their performance after their usual regimen of alchemical enhancers."

Gang Shan nodded slightly. They were all people who used enhancers daily, so of course 'true combat potential' referred to their strength under the influence of their regular doses.

Le Jingchen continued, "Although Le Mulan's physical strength appears to be 4.93, because she can handle more potent alchemical enhancers on a daily basis, her true combat potential is actually far greater. When she really exerts herself, she can perform at a level comparable to someone with a physical strength of 5.05."

"And that is something a simple physical strength test can't measure."

"But once they reach a bottleneck, say at the peak of the Qi Refining stage where both competitors have a physical strength of 10, the one who has undergone the super-metabolism surgery will undoubtedly perform better."

"If you don't believe me," Le Jingchen said with utter confidence, "just watch the upcoming events. Le Mulan will definitely place in the top three."

…

At the same time, Wang Hai's phone was about to explode from the sheer volume of calls.

Zhou Chechen was also being bombarded with one inquiry after another.

"No, Principal! We really haven't had a technological breakthrough."

"Uncle, you should know my situation. I haven't even undergone the surgery myself, so how could I give it to some poor first-year?"

"Auntie, please help me contact Purple Cloud Supplements. I have no intention of breaching our contract. We haven't made any deals with other companies…"

Hanging up, thoroughly exasperated, Zhou Chechen shot a furious glare toward the Songyang High School rest area.

"Zhang Yu… Bai Zhenzhen… just which company did Zhang Pianpian sell them out to?"

Amidst the noise and chaos, as opinions and rumors about companies, high schools, and competitors began to ripple out from the venue, the physical strength test finally concluded. The second event of the athletics meet was about to begin.

---

# Chapter 108: Agility

With a deep rumble, walls began to rise from the stadium floor, partitioning the vast space into a series of smaller rooms.

In the Songyang High School rest area, Zhang Yu watched in amazement. "Purple Cloud High's stadium can actually transform? Compared to this, what is our school's stadium but a glorified sandpit?"

The faces of most Songyang students around him darkened at his words. However, considering the 4.95 physical strength that had just earned him fifth place, no one dared to openly rebuke him. Even He Dayou, the Son of the School Director, could only pretend he hadn't heard the slander against their school.

After all, at Songyang High, scores were king, and a physical strength level like the one Zhang Yu had just displayed was the king of kings. He was at a level where a single glance could shatter the soul of a lesser student.

Wang Hai quickly changed the subject. "The athletics meet doesn't just test physical strength. The next events will test agility, speed, and power."

"Agility is worth 75 points, speed is also 75, and power is worth 150. Every event is crucial. Anyone who specializes too much won't get a good rank, because this meet tests a student's comprehensive physical abilities."

"Pay attention, they're explaining the rules now."

An animated video began playing on the big screen, demonstrating the next trial.

In the video, a single competitor stood alone in one of the small rooms on the field.

A ring of light with a three-meter radius illuminated the ground beneath the competitor's feet.

Of course, the ring's size would be proportionally increased for larger competitors.

Then, the video showed the room's four walls beginning to shoot high-speed steel balls toward the competitor.

Simultaneously, the ring of light on the floor would begin to shrink, steadily increasing the difficulty of dodging the steel balls within its confines.

The trial would end the moment a competitor was struck by a steel ball; stepping outside the circle also counted as a failure.

A competitor's score for this event was determined by how long they could last inside the ring. The longer the time, the better the score, and the one who lasted the longest would take first place.

Any competitor who failed to place in the top twenty in this event would be immediately eliminated, barred from even participating in the next round.

"Everyone understand?" Wang Hai asked. "It's very similar to the agility training I usually have you do, just much more extreme."

Zhang Yu stroked his chin. "In that case, bigger competitors are at a huge disadvantage in this round. They'll have to dodge more steel balls at any given moment."

Wang Hai added, "A larger physique has its advantages. It allows one to excel in the later power competition, so it naturally has its drawbacks, like being an easier target in this agility trial and being at a disadvantage in the upcoming speed event."

"The athletics meet is designed to test all-around physical fitness. Even with certain focuses, it won't allow heavily specialized students to achieve high rankings… power, speed, and agility are all indispensable."

The video then went on to explain some of the finer details, such as the prohibition on circulating mana during the competition, which would be monitored by a mandatory mana-detecting patch.

Zhang Yu nodded, understanding that he would have to temporarily halt even the passive breathing exercise of his Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method.

And since it was an athletics meet testing physical prowess, spiritual roots were also forbidden.

For that reason, Bai Zhenzhen had kept her spiritual root completely suppressed since she had boarded the bus that morning, with no intention of letting its power manifest.

Once the detailed rules had been explained, Bai Zhenzhen spoke up. "The event officially starts in ten minutes. Come on, Yu-boy, let's hit the restroom so we don't have to hold it during the competition."

The two of them headed for the restrooms together. Along the way, they saw teams from the various high schools making their final preparations, which, of course, primarily involved taking alchemical enhancers.

They watched students from ordinary high schools inject unmarked, unpackaged syringes into their acne-ridden arms.

They saw students from White Dragon High, confident in their physical might, downing cans of brand-name potions in front of any nearby cameras.

They observed the dark-skinned monsters from Red Pagoda High injecting needle after needle into their veins.

They witnessed Le Mulan and Lian Tianji from Purple Cloud High performing intracranial injections after their intracardiac ones, enhancing their all-around capabilities…

After seeing all that… well, Zhang Yu was no longer as shocked as he used to be. He wouldn't ask naive questions like, "I thought the athletics meet was only supposed to test physical ability? Why aren't enhancers banned?"

Now, if someone were to ask him that, he would explain with righteous conviction, "When testing the body's various capabilities, that naturally includes its drug resistance. That's just how things are in Kunxu."

They arrived at the restrooms and split off toward the men's and women's facilities.

Although Zhang Yu had sampled many a restroom in his life—including, but not limited to, those at Songyang High, Red Pagoda High, and White Dragon High…

He was still shocked by what he saw now.

_This place actually has a sideboard? And there's a box of chopsticks and a box of spoons on it?_

And since there was a sideboard, the sight of a dining table next to it wasn't quite as surprising.

But when he saw the sign taped to the table that read, "Urinating on the dining table is prohibited,"… he fell silent once more.

_What the hell… are the students at Purple Cloud High this uncivilized?_

However, after reading a notice posted on the adjacent wall, he realized his understanding had been slightly off.

Due to an excessive number of students suffering from mental breakdowns, the school's profits had declined in the previous quarter. As a result, they had implemented a "Care for Underachievers" policy.

Not only had they installed dining tables and sideboards in the restrooms to allow underachievers to eat in comfort and peace, but they had also banned all forms of bullying within the lavatories.

_I see, so it's to care for the underachievers… but that somehow makes it even more like the work of a devil incarnate._

Meanwhile, outside the women's restroom.

Bai Zhenzhen was curiously inspecting the… other doors besides the standard men's and women's rooms.

One of them was labeled: Le Mulan's Private Restroom.

_A private restroom for the top student in the grade?_

Bai Zhenzhen wanted to try going inside, but she found the door had no handle. It seemed to require some form of identity verification to open automatically.

A flicker of envy crossed Bai Zhenzhen's eyes.

"Songyang High is so lame. They should really learn from Purple Cloud. Wouldn't it be great if they built private restrooms for the top three students?"

A few moments later, the two returned to the competition area.

Just before entering the field, Bai Zhenzhen consumed a vial of an intellect-enhancement agent to improve her focus during the event.

Zhang Yu also took a stimulant to increase his reaction speed on the field.

Although he was following a path of natural body tempering, if a little help could earn him a few extra points, he wasn't stubborn enough to refuse it.

Then, they both drank a few bottles of a neural filler to ward off any drowsiness during the late-night competition.

Soon, all the competitors entered the arena. After a mana-detecting patch was affixed to each of them, they were assigned to their individual rooms.

As the ring of light on the floor flared to life, Zhang Yu's nerves tensed.

The next moment, with a sharp whistle, steel balls shot out from the surrounding walls at high speed.

_Not bad… much slower than the Body-Piercing Sword Qi Zhen stabs me with._

The stimulant had fully kicked in, and Zhang Yu's muscles were primed. His reactions were incredibly swift. He watched the incoming steel balls and moved his body fluidly, dodging each one.

_As long as the circle is this big, I don't need to use full concentration yet._

The state of full concentration was the level-ten effect of his Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art. It focused his mind to an unprecedented degree, to the point where the world seemed to slow down.

But full concentration had one drawback: it couldn't be maintained for long.

When he had first mastered it, he could only hold it for a minute.

Now, with the growth of his Dao heart and the strengthening of his martial will, he had extended that time to a minute and a half.

_But since I can still manage in my normal state, I'll wait until the circle gets smaller and dodging becomes more difficult before I activate full concentration…_

…

In the stands.

The influencer Gang Shan watched the field and began his commentary. "In this round, as the circle continues to shrink, the difficulty will increase dramatically. It tests not only the body's reaction time and speed, but also the endurance of one's mental focus…"

Just then, the first eliminations began to occur.

A high-speed steel ball slammed into the leg of a student from an ordinary high school, causing him to stagger.

As his movement faltered, more steel balls shot toward him.

The student's mind was already in a panic; his physical conditioning and mental reflexes were completely overwhelmed by the barrage of projectiles.

_Is the competition this much harder than our usual school training?_

The next moment, as a volley of steel balls rattled against his body, the student coughed up blood and collapsed.

After being removed from the field, he stared at the big screen, at the images of those still competing, his expression a mixture of envy and jealousy.

_Are these guys from the key high schools and the three major high schools all monsters? How can they last this long?_

Similar scenes were unfolding in every corner of the arena, as a large number of competitors from ordinary high schools were eliminated, many of them injured in the process.

Gang Shan directed his viewers' attention from the eliminated students to the competitors from Purple Cloud High, who were dodging with composed ease.

Inside his circle, Lian Tianji seemed to have eyes in the back of his head, making small, precise movements to avoid the incoming steel balls.

Nearby, Le Mulan appeared even more relaxed. She strolled within her circle as if taking a leisurely walk in a garden, letting the blurs of the high-speed projectiles pass right by her, as if they were dancing in unison with her graceful steps.

Gang Shan sighed. "The gap between them is just too vast. Nearly all the students from the ordinary high schools have been eliminated, while those from the three major high schools are still far from their limits."

Le Jingchen looked at the eliminated students with a sense of disdain.

_Spending a few thousand or tens of thousands a month to try and become a cultivator?_

Le Jingchen couldn't understand why these poor people tried so hard to cultivate. In his view, it made little difference to their lives whether they cultivated or not; forcing the issue was just looking for trouble.

But, of course, Le Jingchen would never voice such thoughts aloud. Otherwise, how would Purple Cloud Supplements make so much money? How would his family acquire so many resources?

So, for the live stream, Le Jingchen said, "Actually, the gap isn't as large as it seems. I believe that ordinary high schools also have students with extraordinary aptitude. The reason for the large performance gap we're seeing is often just a lack of access to information."

Before the competition, the three major high schools had kept their technological breakthroughs a closely guarded secret while probing each other for weaknesses.

Now that the competition was underway, Le Jingchen knew there was no longer a need for secrecy.

He continued, "Take, for example, Purple Cloud High's super-metabolism surgery, or the slightly inferior demonic muscle surgery from White Dragon High. If students from ordinary high schools knew about these technologies and underwent these procedures, they might very well have a chance to compete with the likes of Le Mulan and Song Hailong."

With that, Le Jingchen pointed toward Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen. "Look, Gang Shan. After those two students from Songyang High received the new body tempering technology, aren't they now keeping pace with the students from the three major high schools?"

Since he had sensed that Songyang High was trying to make a name for itself at this athletics meet, Le Jingchen had no qualms about using them to promote the new body tempering technology.
