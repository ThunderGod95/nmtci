# Chapter 111: Challenging Yu Xinghan

After surpassing Hu Yuntao, Song Hailong now found himself in second place on the track.

Yet his face showed no hint of joy; he merely stared intently at the distant Yu Xinghan.

_That man..._

To Song Hailong, the only opponent in this race was Yu Xinghan.

At this moment, Song Hailong’s muscles were drawn taut, making him appear a size smaller and giving him a certain streamlined beauty.

He was leveraging his powerful control over his demonic muscle to temporarily shift into a speed-oriented form.

The powerful plasticity of demonic muscle allowed students who had undergone the modification to gradually retract the external demonic beast characteristics as their physical control improved.

For a top student like Song Hailong, who had already undergone an elephant muscle implant modification, adapting to the demonic muscle was not difficult. As his physical control continued to increase, he could even temporarily alter his body's form to enhance his speed.

While the resulting speed was purely explosive and lacked the control necessary for the previous stage, it was perfectly suited for this round's contest of pure velocity.

Every muscle fiber, after contracting to its absolute limit, erupted like a spring forged from steel, unleashing immense kinetic energy.

With each violent beat of his heart, blood pumped to every muscle in his body, constantly transporting surging energy and dispersing the effects of various alchemical enhancers throughout his limbs.

_But it's still not enough._

_This isn't enough to defeat Yu Xinghan._

Song Hailong recalled his failures over the recent past, how he had fallen before Yu Xinghan time and time again, utterly defeated by the man in every aspect: Dao heart, mana, athletics, martial skill, and Daoist arts.

He remembered the repeated humiliations at the man’s hands in front of the entire school.

He remembered the shame of kneeling, his father’s disappointment, his brother’s criticism...

But he knew that for now, all he could do was endure.

_To beat Yu Xinghan, I have to close the gap little by little._

_To dream of soaring to the heavens and defeating him in an instant would be disrespectful not only to his talent, but also to the wealth of a Golden Core True Monarch._

_I will etch the failure of this race into my heart._

_One day, I will defeat you._

For Song Hailong, taking second in this race was already a failure, a disgrace he would never forget.

But a moment later, Song Hailong, still holding second place, felt his gaze shift.

In his peripheral vision, a sudden whoosh of displaced air drew his attention to two figures, one on his left and one on his right, surging past him.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _Thanks, old Song. Drafting behind you saved us from a lot of wind resistance._

_For this final stretch, I'm going all out._

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, who had been conserving their energy while following Song Hailong, suddenly unleashed their power.

Song Hailong was taken aback as he watched Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen shoot past him like a flash of lightning.

_Their physical strength is clearly inferior to mine, yet they can burst forth with such speed? They actually... surpassed me?_

Song Hailong tried to give chase, only to find with a shock that he couldn't keep up.

_Have I slowed down?_

_No, they're accelerating! These two... they can still go faster?_

Song Hailong stared fixedly at Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen just ahead, his eyes locked on the constant ripple, contraction, and expansion of their muscles.

_Has that Bai Zhenzhen been practicing a speed-oriented body tempering cultivation technique?_

Watching the high frequency of her movements and the incredible coordination in her muscular rhythm, Song Hailong sensed an extraordinary lightness about her.

He had to admit that while he could likely overpower her in strength, he had fallen behind in speed.

As for Zhang Yu…

Encased in the tight-fitting athletic wear, Zhang Yu’s muscle definition was clearly visible to Song Hailong, his entire vital energy from head to toe seeming to move as a single, unified whole. With every movement, every explosion of power, it radiated the dazzling brilliance of a perfect work of art.

Only someone with physical control and strength on Song Hailong's level could perceive its stunning brilliance and appreciate the precision and fluidity of that physique.

_Zhang Yu... he's perfectly unleashing every ounce of power in his body..._

Zhang Yu’s physical strength might not have been as great as his own, but his control over his body, his mastery of his muscles, and the speed he was now unleashing at full power seemed utterly dazzling to Song Hailong.

It was as if everyone possessed electromagnetic force within them, but not just anyone could fire a railgun.

And now, as Song Hailong looked at Zhang Yu—a person with slightly less physical strength than himself—he felt only power, a familiar sense of power.

_It's... Yu Xinghan!_

_Zhang Yu's ability to extract power from every muscle in his body... has it reached the same level as Yu Xinghan?_

Watching Zhang Yu pull farther and farther away, Song Hailong pumped his legs furiously but couldn't close the distance by a single inch.

It was the same feeling he got every time he tried to catch up to Yu Xinghan.

Unconsciously, the figures of Zhang Yu and Yu Xinghan seemed to merge into one.

No… they weren’t merging!

_Damn it... that kid Zhang Yu is about to catch Yu Xinghan!_

To Song Hailong's astonishment, after surpassing him, Zhang Yu quickly left Bai Zhenzhen behind, accelerating, accelerating, and accelerating again, until he actually began to close in on Yu Xinghan.

His steps grew lighter and lighter, each stride covering dozens of meters, as if he were about to fly into the sky and pluck the stars from the heavens; and the glittering star he was rapidly approaching was none other than Yu Xinghan.

Song Hailong’s heart trembled. _He wants to challenge Yu Xinghan?_

Challenge Yu Xinghan? The undisputed number one, a man whose overall physical attributes surpassed every other competitor here?

Meanwhile, the third eye on Yu Xinghan’s brow clearly saw the figure that was gradually catching up.

Yu Xinghan smiled. "Oh? Did you really catch up?"

At a moment when everyone was pushing forward at full speed, unleashing all their strength.

Yu Xinghan suddenly turned his head to look back at the pursuing Zhang Yu.

He even spoke, his voice carrying over the wind, "I know you."

"You're the one I eliminated, aren't you?"

"If it weren't for me, my master would have taken you as his disciple."

"So... you must hate me, don't you?"

Hearing the powerful voice carried on the gale, Zhang Yu did not reply.

He had no intention of wasting energy on conversation. Right now, his eyes saw only victory.

Whether his opponent was Song Hailong or Yu Xinghan, they were simply obstacles to be overcome.

_Beat them, win this competition._

_Get into the Ten Greats._

_And climb to the second level of Kunxu with Zhen!_

At this moment, Zhang Yu simply continued to unleash his body’s power, just as he had through countless days and nights of running; though he couldn't circulate his mana, he could still vent the full might of his vital energy.

As if sensing the determination in Zhang Yu's gaze, Yu Xinghan smiled faintly. "Not bad. You're truly worthy of someone who, like me, has mastered the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art."

"In that case... I'll play with you for a bit."

To everyone's astonishment, Yu Xinghan suddenly slowed down, seemingly moving backward relative to the onrushing Zhang Yu, until he was running right alongside him.

Then, as Yu Xinghan and Zhang Yu raced shoulder-to-shoulder, kicking up a gale, he slowly raised his right hand and extended three fingers.

Three!

Then two fingers.

Two!

Zhang Yu’s breath hitched, and he mentally gritted his teeth. _A countdown? This guy..._

Zhang Yu understood at once; Yu Xinghan wanted to fall back to his position and race him from an even start.

The next moment, Yu Xinghan held up a single finger.

One!

A roar erupted in Zhang Yu’s mind.

If he had been sprinting at his limit before, then at this instant, every muscle fiber and every drop of blood in his body, under his exquisite control, erupted in a supercharged burst.

Though he couldn’t circulate mana, the experience from countless sprints and numerous level-ten cultivation techniques—Sports Car Legs, Elevator Leap, the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms, the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi—all surged forth in an overloaded display.

His entire vital energy became an extension of his thoughts, obeying his will and charging forward with frenzied desperation.

The muscular self-limiters that the Songyang High School team needed surgery to release were something Zhang Yu could now shatter through sheer force of will and physical control.

Under this supercharged burst, his muscles began to tremble and his organs seemed to groan as his body erupted with a speed that shattered his limits.

But he had no energy to spare for such details; his eyes were fixed on Yu Xinghan, who he was doggedly keeping pace with.

_I can do this..._

_I can beat him._

_My control over my body is greater than his. I'm better at accelerating, better at pushing past my limits._

_Even if my physical strength is lower, I can still be faster!_

Under the astonished eyes of the countless spectators.

Zhang Yu and Yu Xinghan accelerated again and again, as if starting a new race entirely.

The two figures, like streaks of light, instantly left everyone else behind, bolting down the track.

Neck and neck!

...

"So fast!" Qian Shen muttered. "Can first-years really be this fast?"

In the Songyang High School rest area, He Dayou, Qian Shen, Zhao Tianxing, and the others all watched in shock as Zhang Yu ran neck and neck with Yu Xinghan, the strongest competitor in the field, the two of them like twin bolts of lightning on the track.

"Running neck and neck with Yu Xinghan's level 5.07 physique with only a level 4.95..." Wang Hai watched the speeding Zhang Yu on the large screen, his expression thrilled as a trembling thought crossed his mind.

_Does this mean Zhang Yu's ability to tap into his body's power... is greater than Yu Xinghan's?_

But he quickly dismissed the incredible idea.

"No, impossible. It must be some kind of potent drug to unlock his potential."

"But for a drug to let Zhang Yu match Yu Xinghan's speed, the side effects must be immense."

Wang Hai looked at Zhang Yu on the screen with concern. "Can he hold on?"

...

In the stands.

The announcer, Gang Shan, exclaimed, “This student from Songyang High School can actually keep up with Yu Xinghan? The skill level of these two must be higher than most second-years, right?”

Le Jingchen was also watching with utter surprise, wondering, _What in the world has Songyang High School done?_

He nodded. "He must have taken some kind of potent drug to keep up with Yu Xinghan for a short period. It seems that with the help of new technology and drugs, it's not impossible for an ordinary person to challenge a Golden Core disciple."

As he spoke, he had Gang Shan turn the camera toward Le Mulan.

"She's been warming up for so long, the drug should have taken full effect. Mulan is about to make her move, isn't she?"

On the track, Le Mulan, who had been holding fifth place, suddenly accelerated, surpassing Song Hailong in a single burst and then rapidly closing in on Bai Zhenzhen.

Her cheeks were flushed, her breathing was heavy, and steam rose from her body as the purple, vertical-pupil marking on her forehead grew more vivid.

Her coach's words replayed in her mind.

"This is the newest illicit alchemical enhancer from Purple Cloud Labs. A single dose costs a hundred thousand, and it's potent enough to burn an ordinary high school student's organs to ash."

"However, with your super-metabolism surgery, you can handle it just fine."

"Because once the enhancer wears off, your entire body will be plunged into a state of extreme fatigue, you could only take it before this round began."

"And after taking it, you needed to warm up while waiting for its effects to kick in."

"Then, the only thing you have to do is... run."

"Run the rest of the race with all your might before it wears off."

# Chapter 112: Victory and Defeat

Even with her Ice-Skinned and Jade-Boned physique, Le Mulan felt as if her body were about to melt.

Spurred on by the alchemical enhancer, the power within her erupted like molten lava, sending her figure surging forward like a gale.

Purple Cloud High School, Purple Cloud Pharmaceuticals, and the family that backed her had all invested massive resources into this competition and the subsequent promotion of their new technology.

This placed a heavy burden on Le Mulan, one she had never felt before.

But she did not resent this burden.

The care of her family, the investment from her parents, the guidance of her brother—all this had allowed her to live the life of a chosen one since childhood.

Because repeated tests had deemed her genes and her talent to be the most outstanding.

Thus, she constantly received, constantly benefited from special care, and was constantly showered with favorable conditions.

Yet this had also left Le Mulan with something to prove.

She wanted everyone in the family, all the siblings who had been passed over, to understand.

She was worthy of this investment.

And now, with this breakthrough in body tempering technology extending the corporate battlefield to the athletics meet, she finally had a chance to prove herself to her family and repay her parents.

Le Mulan’s eyes were fixed on the distant figures of Yu Xinghan and Zhang Yu.

_I thought I could at least get second..._

With a soft whoosh, Le Mulan shot past Bai Zhenzhen.

_This distance..._ she thought, gritting her teeth as she kept her eyes on Zhang Yu and Yu Xinghan. _It's too far... No, I have to at least try..._

Just then, Le Mulan was surprised to see a shadow appear at her side.

_Someone's caught up?_

_Who?_

_Song Hailong?_

But looking at the slender figure, Le Mulan knew it wasn't him.

_Then... Bai Zhenzhen?_

A flicker of surprise crossed Le Mulan's face; she hadn't expected the person she just passed to catch up so quickly.

_She can actually keep up?_

Meanwhile, amidst the gale, Bai Zhenzhen felt waves of tearing pain from multiple parts of her body, and her internal organs were under immense pressure.

Unlike Zhang Yu, who could push his body beyond its limits and into overload through sheer physical mastery without relying on enhancers.

Although Bai Zhenzhen had managed to absorb some of the training effects of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi through her spiritual root, she was ultimately not at Zhang Yu's level.

That was why she had given herself twelve injections before the race, which was the source of the pressure on her organs.

But as she accelerated alongside Zhang Yu, the quickening of her circulation and the full exertion of her muscles made the scars on her body throb with ever-increasing pain.

So instead of continuing at her maximum pace, she had chosen to hold her position in third.

_I can't catch Yu Xinghan anyway. I'll leave him to Yu-boy._

_I need to conserve my strength. Can't get injured before the next round..._

But just as she was thinking this, Le Mulan caught up to her.

Bai Zhenzhen knew she could no longer afford to hold back.

_Yu-boy is going to beat Yu Xinghan and take first._

_I have to at least hold onto third, or he'll laugh me to death._

Wisps of steam began to rise from Bai Zhenzhen’s body as her muscles strained, and the scars across her skin turned a deep crimson, looking like dragon claws tearing at her flesh and causing an agonizing, ripping pain.

Sensing Bai Zhenzhen right on her heels, Le Mulan accelerated desperately, trying to shake her.

_How can I lose to this pauper?_

_I'll show everyone in the family that their investment in me wasn't a waste._

Bai Zhenzhen doggedly pursued Le Mulan, their two figures sweeping down the track, kicking up colliding gales that seemed about to strike sparks.

_I'm getting into the Ten Greats with Yu-boy!_

The crimson scars on Bai Zhenzhen’s body grew more lurid, as if they would start to bleed from the force of her acceleration, and the agony of tearing flesh intensified.

_Damn it... I knew I shouldn't have skimped on the painkillers..._

With a silent roar, Bai Zhenzhen pushed her increasingly tormented body to its limits, managing to keep pace with Le Mulan down to the final five hundred meters.

_Hah!_

A roar echoed in both their minds, their thoughts narrowing to a single point.

Surpass her!

_I will surpass her!_

The next moment, to Le Mulan's shock, Bai Zhenzhen surged past her, reclaiming third place.

But when an excited Bai Zhenzhen looked ahead, she saw that Zhang Yu’s pace had slackened slightly.

The contest between Zhang Yu and Yu Xinghan, who had been running neck and neck like twin bolts of lightning, was already over.

_Swoosh!_

In the end, Yu Xinghan was the first to cross the finish line.

Zhang Yu followed close behind, stopping, pale-faced, after he crossed.

Bai Zhenzhen crossed the finish line third and ran to Zhang Yu with a look of concern. "What's wrong?"

Zhang Yu shook his head, signaling that he was fine.

Zhang Yu focused on his heart. During the desperate struggle against Yu Xinghan, his body had been pushed to its limits again and again, and he had felt his heart beating faster and faster, as if it were about to burst from his chest.

His heartbeat could no longer keep up with the demands he placed on his body; it couldn't fulfill his will's command for another burst of power.

But under these conditions, under the pressure of the fierce contest and his own frantic exertion, he could feel that his heart, in that short span of time, had completed a transformation that should have taken days, shattering its own limits.

The price, however, was the strain and consumption of his heart muscle, which caused him to fall behind Yu Xinghan in the final sprint.

_It's like when muscles break their limits during exercise,_ Zhang Yu thought. _They need to recover and regrow to become stronger._

_My heart may have achieved a breakthrough under this pressure, but it won't get stronger from nothing. It needs time and resources to repair and grow before it will be stronger than it was..._

At that moment, Zhang Yu felt an extreme hunger wracking his body.

He needed vast amounts of food and nutrients to replenish what he had expended during the race, but more than that, his heart, having just broken through, was crying out for sustenance, expressing its desire for nutrients to grow stronger.

_Breaking a limit is just that._

Zhang Yu thought, touching his chest, _True growth requires a foundation of matter and energy. For my heart to grow stronger, it now needs massive amounts of nutrients and food._

_Then I'll use the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi to accelerate digestion and growth._

Level-ten Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi granted Zhang Yu a powerful metabolism and digestive system, which was one of the reasons his physical strength had been able to increase so dramatically.

Elsewhere, Yu Xinghan shot Zhang Yu a cold glance. _Did he slow down at the end because the drug wore off? Or was it the side effects?_

Although he knew the other boy must have taken some kind of potent drug to keep up, being matched by a student from Songyang High School—especially the very one whose position as a Golden Core disciple he had taken—left a sour taste in Yu Xinghan's mouth.

_It seems I was a bit too careless._

_For the next round, perhaps I'll take something as well._

But when the surrounding cameras focused on him, his smile immediately returned.

"Everyone, remember to look out for the Immortal Resonance Group's demonic muscle surgery next month..."

After leaving the arena, Yu Xinghan took a call from Li Xuelian.

Li Xuelian was the daughter of True Monarch Xinghuo, making her Yu Xinghan's nominal senior sister.

"How is the competition going?" Li Xuelian asked.

Hearing her question, Yu Xinghan reported his results. "I've taken first in all three rounds so far."

"Once I win the final round, it'll be sealed."

"Don't worry, senior sister. I won't let there be any problems with the Immortal Resonance contract."

"Who else could possibly take first place overall in this athletics meet but me?"

...

In the stands.

Le Jingchen's expression was grim; Le Mulan hadn't even made the top three, finishing in fourth place.

In contrast, that Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had somehow used unknown technology and potent drugs to squeeze their way into the top three.

Zhang Yu, in particular, had even run neck and neck with Yu Xinghan for a time.

While this had much to do with Yu Xinghan deliberately falling back, it was still enough to draw massive attention, completely stealing Le Mulan’s spotlight.

"Songyang High School..."

A cold light flashed in Le Jingchen's eyes at the thought of Purple Cloud High School being upstaged by Songyang High.

The next moment, his phone vibrated with a series of incoming messages.

Le Jingchen’s eyes scanned the screen.

_Zhou Chechen of the Zhou family and Lan Ling of the Lan family both said Songyang High had no technological breakthrough?_

_And they said this Zhang Yu... is a dog of Zhang Pianpian from White Dragon High?_

A thought struck Le Jingchen. _White Dragon High School... Immortal Resonance Group? Is this some move by Immortal Resonance?_

He whipped his head toward the large screen. _If Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen are also using Immortal Resonance Group's technology, doesn't that mean five of the top ten are backed by Immortal Resonance?_

Le Jingchen could already see it: after the athletics meet, the technology behind Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen would be revealed, and White Dragon High and the Immortal Resonance Group would emerge as the biggest winners.

...

After the third event, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen immediately headed for the buffet area.

"Zhen," Zhang Yu said as they walked, his face pale, "I need to eat a lot, then circulate my cultivation technique to digest it and speed up my heart's recovery. That way, I can unleash my body's power more perfectly in the next round and defeat Yu Xinghan."

Bai Zhenzhen frowned. "Even if you take first in the next round, will that be enough to win overall?"

The four events of the athletics meet were weighted as follows: physical strength, fifty points; agility, seventy-five points; speed, seventy-five points; and the final strength round, one hundred and fifty points.

Bai Zhenzhen figured that since Yu Xinghan had won the first three rounds, even if Zhang Yu got a perfect one hundred and fifty points in the fourth, he still couldn't catch up.

"So I don't just need to take first place, I have to open up a huge lead over him in the strength competition."

"Yu Xinghan has a perfect two hundred points from the first three rounds combined, while I have one hundred and ninety-one."

Zhang Yu said gravely, "The points are awarded based on performance. If I take first and get the full one hundred and fifty points, the better I perform compared to Yu Xinghan in the strength competition, the lower his score will be."

"To beat him, I have to keep his score below one hundred and forty-one. In other words... I need to outperform him by more than nine points."

Hearing this, Bai Zhenzhen understood just how difficult that would be.

"Outperforming that freak Yu Xinghan by more than nine points in a one-hundred-and-fifty-point event? Is that even possible?"

"Possible or not, I have to try," Zhang Yu said.

"Besides, to allow the competitors who just went all out to rest and recover their stamina, there's an hour-and-a-half break before the next round. We can get a lot done in that time."

And so, upon reaching the buffet area, Bai Zhenzhen brought plate after plate of food to Zhang Yu and watched as he wolfed it all down.
