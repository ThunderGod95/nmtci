# Chapter 113: Pre-Competition Breakthrough, the Sky Pillar

With a series of gulps, Zhang Yu poured a large barrel of synthetic food into his mouth, swallowing it all in one go.

He then circulated the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, and with a churning of his internal organs, he accelerated the digestion of the food before accepting another barrel from Bai Zhenzhen.

After the previous round’s grueling sprint and extreme physical exertion, Zhang Yu felt an insatiable hunger and thirst wracking his entire body, especially from his heart, which seemed to be crying out for sustenance.

Bai Zhenzhen bustled about, continuously bringing barrels of synthetic food to his side.

Compared to pre-made meals, synthetic food was less palatable but easier to digest, making it more suitable for Zhang Yu’s current condition.

To ensure better and faster digestion without wasting a single drop of energy or nutrition, the synthetic food Bai Zhenzhen served was completely unflavored; it was pure sustenance, barrel after barrel, like fuel being poured into Zhang Yu's body.

Though it was disgusting and hard to stomach, Zhang Yu closed his eyes and forced it all down for the sake of the next event.

Besides Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, many students from other schools had also come to the cafeteria area to eat.

There were ordinary high school students who had already been eliminated and were just there for a free meal.

There were also students like those from Red Pagoda High School, who were massive in stature and had astonishing appetites.

However, wealthy students like Yu Xinghan, Song Hailong, and Le Mulan were eating their own provisions and did not join the others.

Hu Yuntao was devouring the synthetic food before him.

Xiong Wenwu, opposite him, was practically inhaling it, downing one barrel after another like a storm.

Watching Xiong Wenwu eat, Hu Yuntao couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration. *Big Brother had taste-removal surgery long ago so that food wouldn't interfere with his cultivation; how many people possess that kind of determination?*

Xiong Wenwu glanced at Hu Yuntao and said, "The first two rounds weren't our strong suit, so falling a little behind doesn't matter."

"But in the strength event up next, we have to let everyone know that Red Pagoda is the strongest."

Hu Yuntao nodded fiercely. "I understand, Big Brother. I'll hold on until the very end in the next event, even if it means breaking my arms and legs."

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu was eating voraciously, two figures suddenly appeared before him.

It was Zhou Chechen, the vice president of Songyang High School's Student Council, and Lan Ling, the head of the athletics department.

Zhang Yu glanced at the ID cards on their chests, wondering what kind of connections these two had used with Purple Cloud High School to get into the contestants' private cafeteria.

Zhou Chechen looked coldly at Zhang Yu, recalling his recent conversation with the people from Purple Cloud.

*Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen most likely underwent technical modification from White Dragon High School through Zhang Pianpian's connections,* he thought.

*If White Dragon pulls this off and later announces that Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu also received the Immortal Resonance Group's latest body tempering technology, then the number of their sponsored contestants who place will surpass Purple Cloud or Red Pagoda, making them the biggest winner in this promotion.*

Recalling the deal between Purple Cloud and his own side, Zhou Chechen said coolly, "You don't need to be so aggressive in this next event. Just participate casually."

Zhang Yu frowned but didn't reply, simply continuing to eat.

Zhou Chechen didn't seem to care whether Zhang Yu answered. "Your little conspiracy with White Dragon High School has been seen through by the other corporations."

"If you want to keep showing off, thinking Zhang Pianpian will toss you an extra piece of meat, you should consider how the other corporations will deal with you. Do you think the person backing you will protect you?"

"Don't get sold out and still be counting the money for them."

After saying his piece, Zhou Chechen left with Lan Ling.

On their way out, Lan Ling asked, confused, "Is that all? Shouldn't we have threatened him a little? We have Purple Cloud backing us now, so we don't need to worry about Zhang Pianpian anymore, right?"

Zhou Chechen shot Lan Ling a helpless look, thinking that this guy had truly trained his brain into muscle. *Extreme body tempering really isn't worth pursuing.*

After a moment's thought, Zhou Chechen explained, "This arena is now the battleground for Red Pagoda Husbandry, Purple Cloud Supplements, and the Immortal Resonance Group. These three corporations are the ones pulling the strings."

"If you fight that hard... aren't you afraid of being crushed by the aftershocks of their clash?"

Seeing Lan Ling's pensive expression, Zhou Chechen elaborated, "Just giving Zhang Yu a little warning is enough. We've done our part. Don't go all out... and end up being targeted by Zhang Pianpian, or even the Immortal Resonance Group."

"Our ability to make a deal with Purple Cloud ultimately relies on our own capital, and Songyang High School's transplant technology is something Purple Cloud wants."

"So we don't have to be like Zhang Yu, who has nothing but his own life to risk, throwing himself into every fight."

"So what if he gets a moment of glory by fighting so desperately? In the end, he won't get into the Ten Greats and will spend his life as someone's dog. Eventually, he'll be targeted by the corporations and sold for a good price by Zhang Pianpian."

Recalling Zhang Yu's appearance just now, Zhou Chechen continued, "Besides, look how weak he looks. To catch up to Yu Xinghan in the last round, he must have taken some kind of potent drug that probably damaged his potential or ruined his body..."

"Coupled with the pressure we just put on him, it will definitely affect him."

"The next round is the strength event, which is White Dragon's and Red Pagoda's specialty. With Zhang Yu's body compromised and his mind affected, his final result is bound to be poor."

"This way, we've warned Zhang Yu as Purple Cloud requested, and in the end, he won't get a good result. That's enough to answer to Le Jingchen..."

Lan Ling nodded repeatedly, feeling that Zhou Chechen, as the student council vice president, was far more thoughtful than a mere head of the athletics department like himself.

Back in the cafeteria, Zhang Yu watched Zhou Chechen and Lan Ling leave as he ate. *What were those two just talking about?*

However, the mention of corporations put him on guard.

After some thought, he called Zhang Pianpian and explained the current situation at the competition.

Then he asked, "If I beat Yu Xinghan in the next round, will I be targeted by some corporation?"

Zhang Pianpian chuckled and asked, "Can you win?"

Zhang Yu thought for a moment, then nodded firmly. "I'm confident."

Zhang Pianpian replied, "Then go win."

"If you can take first place, I'll negotiate with White Dragon for you."

"All you'll have to do is admit you used the Immortal Resonance Group's technology to enhance your body tempering, and then wait for the money to roll in."

Hearing Zhang Pianpian's reply, especially the final word "money," both Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen instantly grew excited.

After hanging up, the two of them devoured their food like a whirlwind, stuffing themselves until their stomachs were bulging.

Patting his belly, Zhang Yu let out a breath. "I'm full. Now to digest, promote my body's growth and recovery, and complete my breakthrough..."

Just then, Zhang Yu noticed the scars on Bai Zhenzhen's body, recalling her strange condition after the sprint.

Zhang Yu suddenly said, "Zhen, after we win the championship, I'll pay to have those scars of yours removed."

Bai Zhenzhen replied, "You said it! You're treating me at the hospital then!"

In Kunxu, treating someone at the hospital was a social gesture reserved for the closest of family and friends.

Zhang Yu nodded. "Don't worry. Since we were kids, when has your old man ever lied to you?"

Bai Zhenzhen retorted, "You son of a..."

A moment later, the two arrived at a more secluded restroom.

Bai Zhenzhen then hugged Zhang Yu from behind, pressing against him. "A'Yu, let me lend you my True Spiritual Root."

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback. "Zhen, what about you?"

Bai Zhenzhen smiled. "I can't have a breakthrough in the next hour and a half anyway. I just need to digest my food and recover some stamina, so I don't need the True Spiritual Root."

"As for you, kid, remember to treat me at the hospital after you win."

As the familiar spiritual root entered his body once more, Zhang Yu took a deep breath, nodded, and walked into the restroom.

He then took out a prepared Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill from the medicine box in his pocket.

*"I thought I wouldn't be training today and wouldn't need this."*

*"Good thing I brought it, though."*

After all, something as expensive as a Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill was something Zhang Yu always kept in his personal bag.

The next moment, Zhang Yu swallowed the pill.

As the medicinal power surged, spiritual energy flooded in, and Zhang Yu began to operate the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi at full capacity.

Every muscle in his body tensed, absorbing the rampant medicinal power and spiritual energy.

At the same time, his heart, which had been depleted during the previous sprint, acted like a black hole, frantically absorbing the nutrients from the food he had eaten, the medicinal power of the pill, and the spiritual energy from the spiritual root.

His organs worked like a rock crusher, completely breaking down the synthetic food he had just consumed, transforming it into warm currents that flowed into his blood vessels and nourished his entire body.

Through long-term integration, the True Spiritual Root within him had long since adapted to Zhang Yu's cultivation of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

At this moment, streams of spiritual energy were being infused into his organs and mixed with those warm currents, accelerating his digestion and absorption.

The largest of these currents naturally flowed towards his heart, accelerating its growth and strengthening it with every passing second.

Under this continuous supply, Zhang Yu's originally pale face gradually became rosy, and his breathing and heartbeat grew stronger and more powerful.

Especially as the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi circulated, his heartbeat sounded like a great drum, its thunderous *thump, thump, thump* echoing throughout the restroom.

Outside, Bai Zhenzhen stood guard at the door, preventing anyone from entering and either disturbing Zhang Yu or witnessing the commotion from his cultivation.

Lian Tianji, who had been looking for Zhang Yu, came over and couldn't help but ask curiously, "Is Zhang Yu in there... cultivating?"

Bai Zhenzhen nodded. "It's quieter in the restroom, easier for him to focus on cultivating and resting."

Lian Tianji cast a thoughtful glance towards the restroom, chatted casually with Bai Zhenzhen for a few more moments, and then left.

As the hour and a half slowly passed, Bai Zhenzhen listened to the sounds coming from inside, feeling Zhang Yu's heartbeat grow steadily stronger, and a sense of confidence grew within her.

*"When Yu-boy takes first place, when he gets first, I'm definitely going to borrow a huge sum of money from him."*

In the blink of an eye, the ninety minutes were up, and the final event of the athletics meet—the strength event, worth a total of 150 points—officially began.

A two-meter-high platform rose from the center of the arena, and then a giant pillar descended from the ceiling of the stadium.

The pillar was silver-black, covered in dense layers of fine runes, and made of some unknown metal, with a diameter of about five meters.

It descended from the ceiling, extending all the way down until it stopped three meters above the platform.

This was the Sky Pillar, the final event.

The pillar could exert a downward force ranging from a minimum of one thousand kilograms to a maximum of one hundred thousand kilograms, capable of accurately testing the strength limit of a Qi Refinement stage expert.

For this event, the numerous contestants would take turns ascending the platform to hold up the Sky Pillar.

# Chapter 114: Brewing

In the live broadcast room, Le Jingchen was explaining the rules and procedures of the Sky Pillar event to the audience.

"The specific process for the Sky Pillar event is... in the first round, each contestant will submit their target weight and then take turns ascending the platform to lift the Sky Pillar."

"This will be repeated for a total of three rounds, and each contestant's final score will be based on their best performance out of the three."

"It's important to note that... during the process of submitting target weights for each round, contestants will not know the weights submitted by others."

"This means that before stepping onto the stage each round, aside from the weight they themselves have to lift, they won't know what weight other contestants are attempting—whether it's higher or lower than their own—until the contestants go up one by one during that round."

Beside him, Gang Shan asked, "So it seems a crucial aspect of this event is judging one's own physical limits."

Gang Shan continued slowly, "If you misjudge your limit and aim too low, your score will be low. But if you misjudge and aim too high, you might fail to lift it at all, wasting an attempt and possibly even injuring yourself."

Le Jingchen nodded in agreement. "That's right. By my estimation, all the contestants will report a relatively easy weight in the first round to acclimate, warm up, and conserve energy while gauging the maximum weight they can lift."

"In the second round, they'll aim for a weight close to their personal limit to secure a baseline score."

"Only in the third round will they go all out and push for their absolute limit."

...

In the Songyang High School rest area.

Wang Hai, He Dayou, and the others were watching Gang Shan's live broadcast while also keeping an eye on the live event.

The reason they were watching Gang Shan's broadcast was due to Wang Hai's recommendation.

Wang Hai had said: If you're going to watch a body tempering streamer, watch Gang Shan. He has a wealth of experience, and he doesn't sell supplements or cultivation techniques. He's one of the few honest streamers out there.

After watching, they found that Gang Shan and Le Jingchen's commentary on the athletics meet was excellent, and so they had continued to watch until now.

Qian Shen, listening from the side, nodded. "I see. So even though this event is a competition, it's really a challenge against oneself."

He Dayou asked, "Teacher Wang, what weight do you think Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen can lift?"

Wang Hai replied calmly, "At least six or seven thousand kilograms should be no problem. Any higher than that... I can't say for sure."

Wang Hai looked at Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, who were in line to submit their target weights, then glanced up at the Sky Pillar. *Besides the exertion of strength, the most important thing in this final event is the insight and judgment of one's own physical limits.*

*A truly skilled body temperer not only possesses immense strength and speed but also has a deep understanding and awareness of their own physical condition.*

*There are only three chances. Will you choose a result close to your limit, or will you attempt to challenge a result that surpasses it?*

*What will you choose?*

The others gasped upon hearing the figure of six to seven thousand kilograms, exclaiming in amazement.

Zhao Tianxing remained silent, feeling that if he, the weakest person present, were to exclaim or even show surprise, he would look like a clown.

*Alas, when a person is weak and poor, their every word and action appears ridiculous in the eyes of the strong.*

*And weakness and poverty are both relative.*

He glanced at Qian Shen and He Dayou beside him and thought, *Even someone as wealthy as Qian Shen or as strong as He Dayou... appears weak and poor in comparison to the contestants in this arena.*

*And no matter how arrogant they were in the past or how much they stood out at school, their actions now seem comical, like those of a clown, when contrasted with the powerful individuals on the stage.*

This was a law Zhao Tianxing had summarized through extensive self-observation... he called it the weak-poor-clown theory.

*When a strong or wealthy person comes before a group of even stronger and wealthier people, they become the poor one or the weak one, then they become comical, and finally, they become the clown.*

Zhao Tianxing lamented internally, *There's no helping it. This is an era where scores are king, the Immortal Dao reigns supreme, and money can achieve divine consultation.*

...

As all the contestants finished submitting their target weights for the first round, the competition officially began.

The contestants would ascend the stage one by one in order of their target weights, from lowest to highest.

The first to take the stage was a student from Purple Cloud.

His body glowing with a faint purple light, he walked slowly onto the platform as the number "2000 kg" appeared on the Sky Pillar.

Looking up at the slowly descending pillar, the Purple Cloud student let out a sharp cry, thrust his palms skyward, and slammed them against the base of the Sky Pillar.

With a loud bang, the slowly descending pillar was brought to an abrupt halt.

After five seconds had passed, the "2000 kg" display vanished, and the pillar slowly ascended back into place.

The Purple Cloud student on the stage breathed a small sigh of relief and walked down.

One by one, contestants took the stage, each lifting their declared weight.

The numbers displayed on the Sky Pillar climbed higher and higher, from 2000 kilograms, to 2500, then to 3000...

By the time Chu Qiuhe took the stage, he was lifting a 3500-kilogram Sky Pillar.

With a shout, he easily stopped the 3500-kilogram pillar, then pushed up slightly, feeling the pressure it exerted.

He estimated silently, *With my strength, I should be able to lift 6500 kilograms at most, right? Should I push it a little higher? Challenge my limit...*

...

Meanwhile, in the broadcast room, Gang Shan and Le Jingchen watched as the students took the stage.

Gang Shan laughed. "As expected, everyone is just warming up in the first round, getting a feel for the Sky Pillar's force."

Le Jingchen said, "How much physical strength can be exerted, and ultimately how much weight can be lifted, is inextricably linked to a person's physical limits and their condition on the day of the competition."

"But for contestants with a strong awareness of their own bodies, this round is enough for them to accurately judge their limits and know how much weight they can lift."

As the two of them commented on the competition, the numbers on the Sky Pillar continued to change, but they generally ranged from two or three thousand kilograms to three or four thousand.

It was clear that no one was using their full strength in this round; all the contestants were adapting to the pillar, conserving their energy, and silently judging how much their bodies could lift.

But even a three or four-thousand-kilogram Sky Pillar was enough to astound many of the students present.

...

Zhang Yu walked onto the high platform and slowly positioned himself directly beneath the Sky Pillar.

He hadn't felt it from below, but now, standing at the center beneath the pillar and looking up... he felt as if the entire sky was being blotted out.

Especially as the Sky Pillar slowly descended, it was as if the whole sky was caving in, creating an immense sense of oppression for the person below.

Zhang Yu reached out and touched the bottom of the Sky Pillar, feeling its weight pressing down from above. *So this is what a 3600-kilogram Sky Pillar feels like?*

By sensing the pillar's weight and observing his own body's condition, the support from every single muscle... Zhang Yu gradually formed an estimate of how much weight he could lift.

As Zhang Yu walked off the stage, he nodded at Bai Zhenzhen, who was preparing to go up.

When Bai Zhenzhen stood beneath the Sky Pillar, feeling the force pressing down from above, she couldn't help but think, *Watching from below and actually lifting it on stage are completely different experiences...*

...

In the broadcast room, Gang Shan said, "Jingchen, who do you think will win this Sky Pillar event?"

Le Jingchen replied, "Demon-kin students have far more muscle mass than other contestants, so even with similar physical strength, their power output is often greater."

"This greater strength from more muscle mass, which was a burden in the first two rounds of agility and speed due to the extra volume and weight, has now become an advantage in this round."

"And among the demon-kin students, Xiong Wenwu has the highest body weight and the greatest physical strength."

"But if Xiong Wenwu represents the pinnacle of raw power, then Yu Xinghan represents the fusion of strength and skill, able to tap deeper into his body's power and unleash greater force with less muscle mass."

"The ultimate champion of this Sky Pillar event will likely be decided between Xiong Wenwu and Yu Xinghan."

...

While Le Jingchen and Gang Shan were talking, the second round of the Sky Pillar event had already begun.

And just as they had predicted, the contestants all chose a weight close to their limit, aiming to secure a baseline score in this round.

As contestant after contestant took the stage, the numbers on the Sky Pillar rose steadily, with every student demonstrating a weight far higher than in the previous round.

Shortly after Lian Tianji successfully lifted a 6000-kilogram Sky Pillar.

Chu Qiuhe failed in his attempt to challenge a 6800-kilogram pillar.

He let out a fierce roar, his palms pressed firmly against the bottom of the pillar, but his body trembled under the 6800-kilogram pressure, unable to stop its descent in the slightest. In the end, he could only grit his teeth and retreat from the stage.

In the broadcast room, Gang Shan said, "Alas, that's what happens when you overestimate your own abilities."

Le Jingchen commented, "A drawback of demonic muscle is that it can reduce one's control over their body, leading to inaccurate judgments. For ordinary people looking to gain immense physical strength, the best method is still to use alchemical enhancers..."

"As for the demon-kin's naturally superior muscle mass and Yu Xinghan's level of physical prowess and control, those require the careful guidance of a Golden Core True Monarch and are not conditions accessible to the average person..."

It was clear that in this Sky Pillar event, Le Jingchen intended to label the championship contenders, Xiong Wenwu and Yu Xinghan, as demon-kin and a Golden Core disciple, respectively, to highlight the greater accessibility and importance of alchemical enhancers and super-metabolism surgery for ordinary people.

Just as Le Jingchen began another promotion for Purple Cloud Supplements' new technology.

It was finally Bai Zhenzhen's turn to take the stage for the second time.

With a burst of strength from her body, she lifted the 7000-kilogram Sky Pillar.

Feeling the state of her body, especially the throbbing of her scars, Bai Zhenzhen thought, *I'll try for 8000 kilograms next round. That should be pretty close to my limit.*

After Bai Zhenzhen finished, it was Zhang Yu's turn.

He lifted the 7000-kilogram Sky Pillar and then walked off the stage with a neutral expression.

Seeing Zhang Yu's 7000-kilogram performance, Le Jingchen thought, *Oh? Based on the level he's shown before, he should be able to lift a much heavier pillar... Did Zhou Chechen's warning work?*

*Or has his body not yet recovered from the potent drugs he took during the last event?*

In the Songyang High School rest area, watching Zhang Yu's performance, Wang Hai sighed inwardly. *Did he really injure his body in the last round? Alas, that's not how you use enhancers. This kid... why didn't he ask me before taking them?*

After Zhang Yu finished, Le Mulan lifted a 7500-kilogram pillar, Song Hailong succeeded at 8300 kilograms, Hu Yuntao managed 8800 kilograms, and Yu Xinghan broke the 9000-kilogram mark.

But Zhang Yu, by the side of the arena, paid no mind to anyone's thoughts, nor did he even watch the other contestants take the stage.

At this moment, his focus was solely on himself, on his own flesh and blood.

He was completely concentrated on his own being, all to unleash his ultimate power in the next round.

Because from the very first time he lifted the Sky Pillar, Zhang Yu, with his deep understanding and mastery of his own body, already knew exactly where his limit was.

With his level of skill, he could even sense how much weight this body could lift after an overloaded burst of power.

So he chose not to waste energy in the second round chasing some baseline score, nor did he go all out early to alert and provoke his competitors.

He simply lifted a 7000-kilogram pillar, neither attracting attention nor expending much effort, and then wholeheartedly focused his mind and conserved his strength, determined to reveal his peak moment on the final stage.

# Chapter 115: Holding Up the Sky

While Zhang Yu was silently conserving his energy and spirit, a wave of gasps erupted from the arena.

In the broadcast room, Gang Shan stared at the "10000 kg" displayed on the Sky Pillar, astonished. "Challenging such a high weight in the second round?"

Xiong Wenwu slowly ascended the stage, his eyes fixed on the Sky Pillar pressing down from above, as if he were watching a section of the sky collapsing towards him.

The next moment, his massive, bear-paw-like hands shot up and slammed against the descending pillar.

With an explosive bang, Xiong Wenwu's entire body tensed, veins bulging on his skin as blood seeped from between his clenched teeth.

But even with such exertion, the Sky Pillar's descent didn't slow in the slightest; it seemed poised to crush the figure on the stage, inch by inch.

However, in the next instant, a ferocious roar burst from Xiong Wenwu, and a sound like a dragon's cry seemed to ripple through the arena, causing countless students and spectators to tremble.

Simultaneously, a bloody mist erupted from all over Xiong Wenwu's body.

The black dragon scales cracked like overstretched clothing, splitting open into one bloody gash after another.

His skin, flesh, and scales couldn't withstand the overloaded burst of power, torn apart by his violently expanding muscles.

And as the bloody mist burst from his body, the descending Sky Pillar gradually came to a halt. With another thunderous roar, he even managed to push it back up by several inches.

The 10,000-kilogram challenge was a success.

Below the stage, Hu Yuntao let out a tiger's roar, leading the Red Pagoda students in a wave of cheers.

Gang Shan was surprised. "He went all out in the second round? His muscles must be severely torn. With an injury that severe, he definitely won't be able to participate in the next round."

"However, with a score of 10,000 kilograms, no one here besides Yu Xinghan has a chance of surpassing it. Now we'll see if Yu Xinghan decides to push himself in the final round."

Le Jingchen watched Xiong Wenwu walk off the stage, but he noticed that wasn't the case.

The boy's injuries... were healing rapidly.

*The Black Dragon bloodline gives them extraordinary regenerative abilities? And on top of that...*

Seeing the medical team rush towards Xiong Wenwu, Le Jingchen felt that this student might very well compete again in the third round.

Le Jingchen remarked, "Xiong Wenwu's 10,000-kilogram achievement will surely motivate the other contestants. The next round is going to be exciting."

...

As the second round concluded, the contestants began submitting their target weights for the final round.

The staff member recording the weights thought to himself, *Was everyone stimulated by Xiong Wenwu's final desperate push? They're all going so hard...*

Just then, his eyes suddenly widened, and he looked up at Zhang Yu. "This number... are you sure?"

After confirming it several times, the staff member finally recorded the target weight Zhang Yu had submitted, though a single question echoed in his mind: *"Is he insane?"*

Meanwhile.

In the White Dragon High School rest area.

Just as Yu Xinghan was about to submit his target weight... he was stopped.

Yu Xinghan spoke to Li Xuelian on the other end of the phone, "Senior Sister, why are you stopping me? You know my strength; this weight is absolutely no problem."

Li Xuelian's voice was calm. "But if you unleash an overloaded burst, you'll get injured."

"Xinghan, your body is very strong, but that also means it's very expensive to repair."

"I don't wish to waste Father's money on medical expenses."

Yu Xinghan said, "What about the contract? If I let this Xiong Wenwu beat me next round, I'll only get second place in this event."

Li Xuelian replied coolly, "Even if you get second in this event, your total score will still be first. You will still be the champion of this athletics meet."

"Don't waste money for the sake of some insignificant ranking."

Yu Xinghan still felt a sense of suppressed frustration.

The thought that he was clearly stronger than Xiong Wenwu but was being prevented from crushing him with a single burst, and might instead have to let him take first place in the final event... it made the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art circulating in his mind feel sluggish.

As if sensing his dissatisfaction, Li Xuelian added a warning, "Xinghan, understand that your body no longer belongs to you. Everything you have belongs to Father. You have no right to consume assets and money that are not yours."

"This is also Father's will."

After ending the call, Li Xuelian thought to herself, *His long-term practice of the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art has made his thinking somewhat rigid. This is a good opportunity to suppress that a bit, and it can serve as a foundation for his next heart art.*

As for the competition rankings, Li Xuelian had no worries.

Yu Xinghan had accumulated too large of a lead in the first three events. Even if he let Xiong Wenwu take first place here, it wouldn't matter. Yu Xinghan would still be the overall champion, and the advertising and endorsement contracts with White Dragon High School and the Immortal Resonance Group would proceed smoothly.

Back in the arena, after Yu Xinghan hung up, he crushed his phone with a crack, and a chilling aura emanated from him, causing all the surrounding high school students to keep their distance.

After a long while, and only after repeated urging from the staff, did he walk over with a frosty expression and submit his target weight for the final round.

...

As the final round of the Sky Pillar began, the contestants, no longer conservative like in the previous round, went all out and began to challenge their limits.

Some succeeded, some failed, and some were injured.

Gang Shan commented, "Everyone's giving it their all this round. The specific numbers for their target weights are also very interesting. I believe that the contestants who can set their target weights most accurately are the ones who have the most thorough understanding of their own limits."

Le Jingchen nodded. "Theoretically, the better one understands their own body and condition, the more precise the weight they set will be."

When Bai Zhenzhen took the stage, the number displayed on the Sky Pillar was 8050 kilograms.

As immense pressure transmitted from her palms, the scars on Bai Zhenzhen's body once again turned crimson, like dragon claws slowly tightening their grip on her.

Perhaps due to the stimulation from the speed competition, her scars now appeared even more vivid, glowing like rubies.

When Bai Zhenzhen let out a fierce cry and pushed the Sky Pillar upward, several scars finally split open, staining her body with blood.

Bai Zhenzhen let out a pained grunt and roared in her heart, *"Damn it, body... hold on! I have to get into the Ten Greats!"*

After holding on for five seconds, Bai Zhenzhen finally lowered her hands and walked off the platform, covered in blood.

Wang Hai immediately ran up to her, sighing helplessly. "You know your own condition. Why didn't you report a lower weight?"

Bai Zhenzhen just smiled without saying a word, thinking to herself, *In the last martial arts competition, I didn't have the money or the confidence to fight to the end.*

*This time, with Yu-boy winning the championship and reimbursing my medical expenses, I can finally let loose a little.*

At this thought, Bai Zhenzhen looked over at Zhang Yu, who was still immersed in his own world, completely focused. *That's right, Yu-boy, keep it up. Your mom is counting on you to cover these medical bills.*

Just then, Bai Zhenzhen felt a wave of heat wash over her. She saw Le Mulan, who was passing by on her way to the stage, steaming like she was being cooked.

Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but complain internally, *How many damn enhancers did she take? Is she trying to turn into an alchemy furnace?*

Le Mulan recalled the process of taking the enhancers just moments before.

Her competition coach had said worriedly, "Even if this is Chairman Le Jingchen's request, isn't this dosage a bit too dangerous?"

Le Mulan had replied nonchalantly, "Give them to me."

She turned to the advertising camera nearby and said slowly, "For other students, this event is just about challenging their physical limits. But for me, having undergone the super-metabolism surgery, this event is also a chance to challenge my medication limits."

After displaying each of the enhancers, Le Mulan injected them one by one into her body. A moment later, she felt her heart pound violently, and her face instantly turned beet red.

"My target weight is 9000 kilograms. This is a result only strength-focused contestants can achieve, but now... I can do it!"

On the stage, after Le Mulan shakily supported the 9000-kilogram Sky Pillar for five seconds, she suddenly collapsed to her knees, feeling her leg bones fracture.

But facing the countless cameras and the upcoming media blitz, she knew she couldn't show weakness; this was her responsibility as a key member of her family's next generation.

So she forced herself to her feet, trying her best to walk off the stage as if nothing had happened.

The moment she was offstage, she was surrounded by cameras. Although her head was spinning, with reminders from her coach, Le Mulan managed to deliver her advertising lines.

After Le Mulan's successful 9000-kilogram lift, Song Hailong managed 9300 kilograms, Hu Yuntao, drenched in his own blood, lifted 9800 kilograms, and Yu Xinghan broke 10001 kilograms, becoming the second person in the entire competition to successfully challenge a 10-ton Sky Pillar.

Then, under the watchful eyes of the entire crowd, Xiong Wenwu, still bearing the bloody marks of his last attempt, slowly ascended the stage.

But just as everyone was anticipating Xiong Wenwu's performance, Wang Hai noticed something strange.

"Where's Zhang Yu? Why hasn't he gone up yet?"

"Is he scheduled after Xiong Wenwu?"

"Just how many kilograms did he report?"

Meanwhile, Xiong Wenwu once again looked up at the slowly descending Sky Pillar, feeling the oppressive black mass gradually obscure his vision, as if the sky itself were falling.

And this feeling of the sky falling... he had experienced it countless times since he was a child.

Every screening at the breeding facility, every time a companion was eliminated, every exam after entering high school... each time was so tense, so terrifying, so utterly helpless.

Just like at this very moment, as he tried to raise his palms to hold back the pressure descending from the heavens.

He could only feel the 10,800-kilogram weight pressing down with an unstoppable force, forcing his head down, bending his back, and driving him to his knees.

A referee nearby asked, "Xiong Wenwu, do you wish to continue?"

Xiong Wenwu didn't hear the referee; his mind was filled only with the orders given by his father.

*"10,800 kilograms. You should be able to do that, right? Isn't the strength event supposed to be your specialty? If you can't even do this, who will buy the new technology Red Pagoda is launching?"*

*"Injured?"*

*"If you don't get injured, how can you demonstrate the restorative capabilities of the new technology?"*

*"Getting injured is a good thing. The more severe the injury, the better you can showcase your recovery."*

At this moment, Xiong Wenwu's muscles grew tighter and tighter, his teeth felt like they were about to shatter, and his heart pounded like a car engine.

*I can do it!*

*I can do it, Father!*

*I am not the same as I was before, not the same Number 33456 who could only watch helplessly as fate was decided, as the sky fell.*

*I have studied now, I have cultivated the Immortal Dao, I am a high school student! A chosen one destined for university!*

*Now... I can hold up the sky!*

*ROAR!*

As the muscles in his arms burst, Xiong Wenwu violently stopped the descending Sky Pillar.

Then, as his massive body rose to its full height, the Sky Pillar was pushed back a full meter.

With the sound of tearing muscles and cracking bones, bloody blossoms erupted all over Xiong Wenwu's body, and a trickle of blood from his ruptured organs flowed from the corner of his mouth.

The next five seconds felt as long as his entire life.

When Xiong Wenwu came to his senses, he had already collapsed on the stage.

Looking at Hu Yuntao rushing towards him, Xiong Wenwu murmured, "Did... did I succeed?"

Hu Yuntao nodded repeatedly, exclaiming excitedly, "You did it, Big Brother! With this promotion, the Black Dragon bloodline technology will definitely be a huge seller!"

Immediately, cameras swarmed in, beginning to document the entire process of Xiong Wenwu's recovery.

Hu Yuntao encouraged him from the side, "Big Brother! You have to hold on, don't pass out! You still haven't said the advertising slogan..."

Just as Xiong Wenwu was being carried off, with the Red Pagoda students cheering for their first-place victory and the other students and spectators marveling at his achievement.

The Sky Pillar on the stage trembled slightly, and a new number appeared.

12531 kg.

Only then did everyone realize there was still a contender left. Who could it be?
