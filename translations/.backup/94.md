# Chapter 92: Advanced Experience from a Key High School

Zhang Yu’s willingness to teach a trial class stemmed from his confidence in his instructional abilities.

This confidence came not only from the fact that the three techniques he was to explain—Limitless Cloud Hand, Excavator Palm, and Sports Car Legs—had all reached level 10.

It was also rooted in the exquisite understanding of mana control he had gained after advancing both the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method and the Limitless Cloud Hand to level 10.

And then there was the profound understanding of physical structure and muscular exertion he had acquired after his Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms and Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi reached level 10.

Of course, the experience and insights gained from level 10 techniques like Limitless Cloud Hand, the Imperishable Seal Art, the Dragonback Mountain Toppler Hand, and the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art had also caused his own martial arts skills to rise steadily.

Without even realizing it, Zhang Yu's control over his mana, his body, and his martial techniques had already reached a level he had never dared to imagine before.

Furthermore, all of these breakthroughs had been achieved within the last two months.

This meant that, at this very moment, he still vividly recalled the feeling of advancing each of these techniques from level 1 to level 10.

He still remembered the many difficulties, questions, and points of confusion he had encountered as a novice cultivating these arts.

Thus, with his current perception and experience, when he now explained the various techniques within the Limitless Cloud Hand, he could often pinpoint the essentials in just a few words, casually offering insights that would take others years of effort to comprehend.

Cai Tou, who had ‘Daily Lesson’ tattooed on his arm, had only cultivated the Limitless Cloud Hand to level 8. After listening to Zhang Yu for just a few minutes, he felt a sense of sudden enlightenment, as if a great weight had been lifted from his mind, and even had the urge to begin cultivating right there on the spot.

In particular, Zhang Yu's guidance and insights regarding the level 8 Limitless Cloud Hand made Cai Tou feel as though he were speaking directly to his heart.

"Excellent, truly excellent. That was an incredible explanation," Cai Tou said, his face alight with excitement. "If Teacher Ma ever offers a course on the Limitless Cloud Hand, I will definitely sign up."

Nearby, Da Chan and Che Nu exchanged a glance, a flicker of surprise in their eyes; they hadn't expected Cai Tou to hold this Ma Yunteng in such high regard.

After receiving Cai Tou's praise, Zhang Yu looked toward Che Nu and said, "Then I will next explain Sports Car Legs…"

But just then, Black Crow, who was standing to the side, suddenly interjected, "Teacher Ma, your lecture is excellent, but if you could add just one more little thing, it would be even more popular here."

Zhang Yu asked curiously, "Add what?"

Black Crow replied, "A little of the key high school teaching style."

As Zhang Yu was wondering what a key high school’s teaching experience entailed, the doll hanging on his chest explained, "Just treat them the way your teachers treated you when you were at a key high school. Bring out the experience of how you were educated there."

Zhang Yu grew thoughtful, then looked at the few people before him and asked, "When I was in key high school, I taught only sterilized students. I was wondering, are the three of you teachers currently in a sterilized state, or have you already undergone reversal surgery?"

Cai Tou spoke with some embarrassment, "We all attended regular high schools; sterilization wasn't required back then."

Zhang Yu let out an "oh."

And as Cai Tou, Che Nu, and Da Chan looked at Zhang Yu, who presumably had been sterilized, and then at themselves, who had not, they suddenly felt as if they were a class below him.

Zhang Yu decided to draw upon his experiences from White Dragon High School as well, asking, "I see we have restrooms here. Do teachers and students need to use them? Is it necessary to consider students' restroom needs during class?"

The three exchanged glances before nodding in unison.

Zhang Yu asked with curiosity, "There’s another question I've always wanted to ask. Can’t you choose the flavor of the intellect-enhancement agent here? I don't think I've ever smelled it."

Cai Tou replied, a bit awkwardly, "Our facilities are limited. We don't add intellect-enhancement agents to the air circulation system."

Black Crow, however, watched with gleaming eyes, thinking to himself, _Yes, yes, that's the vibe. The smell of a key high school humiliating its students._

Subsequently, Zhang Yu became increasingly adept at integrating the high school teaching experience into his lessons.

He thought to himself, _Hmm, it's not too difficult. I just have to repeat how the teachers at Songyang High School normally discriminate against low-scoring students, and how the people from White Dragon and Purple Cloud speak to those from Songyang._

And as Zhang Yu continued to explain Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs.

Che Nu and Da Chan discovered that Zhang Yu's understanding of Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs was in no way inferior to their own, and that he possessed a unique comprehension of muscular exertion and mana circulation.

What surprised them even more was that Zhang Yu knew all the various key points for cultivating these two techniques from level 1 to level 10 by heart, as if he had only just recently broken through.

But the two of them knew, of course, that it was impossible for him to have just recently cultivated these level 10 techniques. The only explanation was that his teaching experience was exceedingly rich, that he had guided all sorts of students through breakthroughs at different levels of these two techniques.

Che Nu cupped her hands, her previously cool expression vanishing as her face filled with admiration.

"Your teaching quality is exceptionally high, and your teaching style is mature. You are more than qualified to teach here."

Although Da Chan, standing to the side, did not speak, he nodded slightly, endorsing Che Nu's statement.

After all, in the dark world of tutoring, teaching quality was king, and everyone in the gang admired those with strong lecturing skills.

As for Zhang Yu's teaching style, it was so authentic it needed no further comment. Just the aura of someone who could weave the score-based hierarchy into his conversation, the casualness of his words, showed that he not only had a high level of martial arts but was also a graduate of a proper key high school.

Black Crow thought to himself, _If we advertise him under the banner of a retired key high school teacher, we could definitely recruit a lot of students._

But the most surprised person on the scene, from beginning to end, was certainly not these three teachers from the Dark Learning Gang, nor was it Black Crow off to the side.

It was the doll hanging on Zhang Yu's chest.

_This guy only learned Excavator Palm a few days ago!_

_It seems he doesn't just learn techniques quickly; it's not just about speed, but a true and thorough comprehension. He can even fuse various techniques into one, truly mastering the power within._

_Damn it…_ the doll thought inwardly. _How on earth was this potential unlocked? Could it be that, without my knowledge, I have actually, inadvertently, mastered such a terrifying method for stimulating potential, and in doing so, created this peerless prodigy, Zhang Yu?_

_Doesn't that mean I have the aptitude to become an evil god king?_

_Could that be the very reason why I was betrayed by others?_

Zhang Yu then briefly demonstrated his teaching proficiency in the Crane Claw and the Elevator Leap, which were naturally met with approval, causing everyone to admire the breadth of his knowledge even more.

After seeing off Cai Tou and the other two, Black Crow began to discuss the specific details of the classes with Zhang Yu.

In the end, a course schedule was determined based on Black Crow's suggestions, the doll's experienced input, and Zhang Yu's own considerations.

But the first thing Black Crow brought up was the issue of taxes.

He explained, "It's no problem if you wish to remain anonymous. You don't have to purchase the rights to disseminate or teach the techniques, but taxes must be paid. We will withhold them on your behalf."

"It's just that taxes are too important. In the past, some gangs didn't bother with it, letting teachers file their own taxes. But then they encountered some daredevil who secretly evaded them. He was eventually discovered by a righteous god, and the entire gang was captured as one. The whole gang went bankrupt and was saddled with a lifetime of fines they could never repay. They're still working overtime in a corporation to pay off the debt. I hear their overtime is already scheduled out for the next 200 years…"

As Black Crow spoke, a trace of fear showed in his eyes.

"So, we cannot be careless when it comes to paying taxes. My gang will take full responsibility for paying them for you, so you won't have to worry about it."

"The tutoring fees we calculate for you are always figured after our commission and taxes."

Aside from the Limitless Cloud Hand, the most profitable courses were naturally Excavator Palm, Crane Claw, Sports Car Legs, and the Elevator Leap.

Black Crow said, "So, Teacher Ma, when would be a convenient time for you to start teaching?"

Zhang Yu replied, "The sooner, the better."

Black Crow smiled slightly. "Alright then. I happen to have an Excavator Palm class that needs a teacher. There are currently 59 students enrolled. Each class is 60 minutes long, and we will pay you 6,500 per class. For now, we'll schedule 10 classes a week. How does that sound?"

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's heart skipped a beat, and he couldn't help but feel his breath catch in his throat.

He thought to himself, _Ten classes a week, that's 65,000? Damn, the dark world of tutoring is really lucrative!_

But Black Crow, seeing Zhang Yu remain silent, assumed he thought the amount was too low. After all, an expert who could cultivate multiple martial arts to level 10, someone at the absolute peak of Qi Refinement, would surely have high income and expenses.

So Black Crow said, "You are new here, after all. Once your teaching quality is recognized, we can definitely arrange more classes and more students. Your income will certainly see a big increase then."

Zhang Yu nodded in agreement, suppressing the eagerness in his heart.

"When do the classes start?"

"Tomorrow."

…

That evening, after leaving the compound, Zhang Yu let out a slight sigh of relief.

He thought to himself, _This way, I’ll have an income of 65,000 a week. If I do well and more classes are arranged, my income could be even higher._

At this thought, Zhang Yu truly breathed a sigh of relief, feeling a great deal of the financial pressure on his shoulders lift.

"With this, I'll have the money to eat Crimson Marrow Primordial Pills, and my body tempering can finally improve quickly. Participating in the sports competition shouldn't be a problem anymore."

Just then, the doll on his chest spoke up, "Well? I didn't lie to you, did I? What kind of legitimate job makes money as fast as running with the underworld?"

"And I know this Kunxu's various underworlds and dark worlds like the back of my hand. With me helping you, your chances of climbing higher will only increase."

Zhang Yu did not reply, but he had to admit that learning about the dark worlds through this evil god was indeed beneficial to his path of the Immortal Dao.

On the way back, the doll, in an effort to show its presence or perhaps to continue demonstrating its importance to Zhang Yu, reminded him.

"Remember this, Zhang Yu. In this illegal tutoring business, the most important thing is that you can't trust anyone. Also, since you're in this line of work, don't you ever feel sorry for the people who buy your courses."

"Almost everyone who comes to the dark world of tutoring to buy courses is dirt poor, but don't you mind whether their money comes from loans, selling their house, or mortgaging their organs. They buy, we sell. It's not like we forced them. If they go bankrupt or jump off a building later, that's their own fault for being poor and still trying to cultivate…"

Over the next few days, Zhang Yu cultivated at school during the day, and at night he either cultivated in the abandoned building or taught classes at the Dark Learning Gang's compound. He finally saved up enough money to purchase another Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill, gradually beginning a routine of consuming one every few days.

# Chapter 93: Zhang Yu's Secret

That night, as he swallowed the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill, its potent medicinal power once again drilled into his limbs and bones.

Zhang Yu immediately activated his Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, causing the muscles, organs, and bones throughout his body to exert their full strength, striving to absorb the surging medicinal power.

At moments like these, Zhang Yu could always feel distinctly that the 30,000 he spent on the alchemical enhancer had not vanished, but had instead integrated into his body, ultimately becoming a part of his own vital energy.

A night passed in a flash. Zhang Yu looked at the Feathered Tome, which displayed a body tempering level of 2.08, and a satisfied smile appeared on his face.

Two weeks had now passed since the martial arts competition.

There were still two weeks until the confirmation of the top five sports scores, which would determine whether Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen were qualified to join the sports competition team.

There were still six weeks until the start of the sports competition.

And although Zhang Yu had focused his main efforts on his physical strength during this time, with the support of his heart art and passive breathing exercise, his Dao heart and mana had naturally improved as well.

The Feathered Tome showed Dao heart level 3 (93%) and mana 25.5.

"The improvement of my Dao heart and mana seems to have slowed down just a little, but it's not a major issue for now. I don't need to consider changing to a more powerful cultivation technique yet. For now, I'll keep my attention on my physical strength."

"With my current income, not only can I maintain a steady supply of Crimson Marrow Primordial Pills, but if my income increases a bit more in the future, I can even add more dietary supplements."

"If I continue to increase my physical strength with the level 10 Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi like this, then entering the top five in two weeks shouldn't be a problem, and it might not be impossible to reach level 4.0 or higher for the sports competition in six weeks."

Thinking of this, Zhang Yu looked at his savings.

During this period, although he had tutored Song Hailong again and taught at the compound, with the arrival of a new month, after deducting 15,000 for loan interest, just under two thousand for rent and utilities, and expenses for Crimson Marrow Primordial Pills, food, and so on, Zhang Yu now had only a little over five thousand left in his account.

"Sigh, I'm still poor. I hope they arrange more classes for me soon."

The thought flashed through his mind as Zhang Yu hurried to the school.

Upon arriving at the school gate, Zhang Yu saw the results of the monthly exam displayed.

On this day of the monthly exam results, the teachers and students within Songyang High School were in a jubilant mood, cheerfully welcoming the new scores.

And thinking back to the exam two days prior, Zhang Yu sighed slightly, "What a pity. If the monthly exam had been a few days later, after I took this second Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill for body tempering, my score would have been a bit higher."

"But it's not a big problem. My sports score should be higher on the next monthly exam."

After a casual glance at the monthly exam rankings, Zhang Yu headed towards his classroom.

For him, the monthly exam was long since something to pay only slight attention to; the competition was what he truly valued.

He still clearly remembered the words Zhang Pianpian had told him.

Zhang Yu murmured to himself, "If you want to get into a top 10 university, then win all the remaining competitions in your first year and become the strongest first-year student in Songyang City."

But just as Zhang Yu was about to step into the academic building.

With a loud bang, a figure fell from the sky, plummeting toward the ground.

Zhang Yu instinctively dodged, then reached out to catch the person. As white Formless Cloud-Astral Qi surged forth, it generated a gentle force that caught the figure falling from the sky, deflecting the downward momentum.

Looking at the person he had saved, Zhang Yu was momentarily stunned. "You're… Shuang Youpeng?"

He still remembered this student, once the top scorer of the first year and now a second-year, being obediently reprimanded by the Student Council vice president, Zhou Chechen, during combat class.

"There's a fine for jumping off buildings at school. It's a good thing I saved you."

"Besides, at your level, a fall from this height wouldn't kill you, would it? Wouldn't it be worse to get seriously injured and need treatment?"

But in the next moment, Zhang Yu realized something was wrong.

Although Shuang Youpeng's face hadn't changed much, the feeling he gave Zhang Yu was… light, incredibly light.

It was as if more than half of the vital energy beneath his clothes had vanished, not at all like the robust strength a second-year student should possess.

Facing Zhang Yu's questioning gaze, Shuang Youpeng said nothing. He neither thanked him for the rescue nor blamed him for it; he simply stood up silently and walked toward the academic building.

Zhang Yu opened his mouth, but was at a loss for words.

He sensed a kind of dead-hearted numbness from the other boy.

Finally, Zhang Yu said, "Are you okay?"

Shuang Youpeng's steps paused, and he said faintly, "I'm fine now. It was a moment of weakness. I still have debts to repay; I won't jump again. Regarding what happened today, please don't tell anyone, otherwise the school will fine me."

At this point, Shuang Youpeng fell silent for a moment before saying, "That sports competition… you'd better give up. It won't end well for you."

…

Inside the classroom of first-year, class one.

Several students were gathered around He Dayou, congratulating him.

"Dayou, you've improved so much lately! You actually got first in the year on this monthly exam."

"662 points! With a score like that, you could probably get into White Dragon High School for a tour for free."

"General Knowledge 49, Dao Heart 130, Mana 143, Sports 150, Martial Arts 95, Daoist Arts 95… Only the top students from the three major high schools could match these scores, right?"

He Dayou looked at these sycophants who flocked to whoever had the best scores, a disdainful smile flashing across his lips.

In the martial arts combat exam of this month's test, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had been assigned to the same group, allowing He Dayou to finally achieve a score befitting his skill level.

"I've finally gotten the score I deserve in martial arts."

As for Daoist arts, that had always been his strong suit, and his sports score, after his recent training with the competition team, had become the highest in the grade.

Just then, his phone vibrated; the information he had asked another student to find had arrived.

It was Zhang Yu's current body tempering level.

"That kid Zhang Yu, always skipping sports class. In this monthly exam, I can finally see his body tempering level measured on the test field yesterday… 2.05, is it?"

"As expected of Zhang Pianpian's dog. He must have been fed a lot of things to reach this level."

"However… it's still a far cry from my 2.3 body tempering level, and from now on, the gap between us will only grow wider."

Seeing Zhang Yu's body tempering level, He Dayou finally let out a breath, feeling that all the effort and money he had poured into the competition team had not been in vain.

"Zhang Yu, from now on, you will experience what it feels like to give your all and still be unable to catch me."

In contrast to He Dayou's excitement, Zhao Tianxing felt utterly miserable.

"Have even Yu-boy and Zhen been completely surpassed by He Dayou?"

Although he was somewhat envious of He Dayou and the others, Zhao Tianxing, like Qian Shen, ultimately quit the sports competition team. He watched as another student was brought in to fill the spot, and then that student's body tempering level skyrocketed, and their monthly exam score surpassed his own.

Zhao Tianxing thought to himself, _Qian Shen disdains using money to buy strength, using money to buy points. That's why he quit the competition team._

After Zhao Tianxing had also quit, he could feel that Qian Shen regarded him with more respect.

But he knew that his situation was completely different from Qian Shen's, and he possessed none of Qian Shen's coolness or decisiveness.

He knew that he had chosen to quit the competition team simply because of his own weakness.

He wasn't confident that he could achieve sufficiently outstanding results after his parents had spent half their life's savings on him.

"The sponsorship fee to join the competition team would require my mom and dad to sell our house."

"This is only the first year. What if it costs more money in the future?"

"With my talent, after spending so much money, will I really be able to earn it back in the future?"

Zhao Tianxing had no confidence at all. He was afraid of wasting his parents' savings, afraid of being saddled with huge debts while accomplishing nothing. In the end, he chose to give up.

_I'm such a waste. And I even told Qian Shen that I was like him and didn't want to buy my score, when the truth is I both want it and am afraid of failure._

…

In the cafeteria, Zhao Tianxing put down his tray, his face clouded with gloom.

He saw Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, as if in a competition, voraciously devouring the synthetic food before them.

_Sigh, Yu-boy and Zhen are always so optimistic. They don't seem the least bit discouraged even though their rankings were surpassed in this month's exam. I wish I could be like them._

Bai Zhenzhen, while eating, glanced at the protein milk in Zhang Yu's hands and thought, _Yu-boy has been eating better and better lately. Did he find money? Or did he sell something he shouldn't have?_

Zhang Yu, while eating, looked at the mush on Bai Zhenzhen's tray and thought, _Zhen needs to improve her body tempering too. Money must be pretty tight for her recently, right? I wonder if she'd be interested in the dark world of tutoring._

The doll hanging on Zhang Yu's chest was also observing Bai Zhenzhen, and after several days of observation, she had come to a conclusion.

So the doll transmitted a message to Zhang Yu's mind, "Hey, Zhang Yu, do you know there's something in that woman's belly?"

"Pfft!"

Zhang Yu felt himself choke, almost spitting out the food in his mouth.

He turned away, lowered his voice to a level only he could hear, and said to the doll, "Zhen's pregnant?"

On the other side, Bai Zhenzhen looked at the mush Zhang Yu had spat into her bowl, and she was genuinely furious.

"Are you trying to die, Zhang Yu? Using such a low-down trick to steal food? I'm going to piss in your bowl!"

The doll said in Zhang Yu's mind, "The thing I'm talking about is a spiritual root. There's a spiritual root in this woman's belly."

Zhang Yu rolled his eyes. "No kidding. Zhen rented a spiritual root."

The doll, however, chuckled. "Really? According to my observations, the spiritual root in that woman's belly should be her own. It's just that this spiritual root is extremely good at concealing itself. If you weren't with her every day, and if she didn't always use that spiritual root so freely in front of you, I wouldn't have been able to notice it."

Zhang Yu looked at Bai Zhenzhen in shock, thinking to himself, _A spiritual root is growing in Zhen's belly?_

Bai Zhenzhen said irritably, "What are you muttering about? Hurry up and go buy me a new lunch!"

Zhang Yu's mind was still on the matter of the spiritual root as he grabbed his student card and ran off to buy Bai Zhenzhen's meal.

Bai Zhenzhen watched as Zhang Yu's phone, left on the table, vibrated softly as a message came in.

Lian Tianji: The clothes you've worn, sell me one.

When she saw this message, Bai Zhenzhen fell silent. She quietly turned off the screen of Zhang Yu's phone.

"No wonder I felt like Yu-boy had money recently."

"So, without me even realizing it, he has already gotten this far ahead?"

_Yu-boy! For money, for the Immortal Dao, you've already gone to such lengths?_


# Chapter 94: Zhang Yu's Temptation

At Purple Cloud High School, a photograph was currently displayed on Le Mulan's phone screen.

The photo showed a smiling Zhang Yu standing at the entrance of a general store, giving a thumbs-up to the camera.

The text below the photo read: Gaofeng Stationery, the best stationery store at the entrance of Songyang High School. The owner is super nice, the items are great value for money, and I strongly recommend everyone to check it out.

Two slender fingers pressed against the screen and stretched, enlarging the photo until Zhang Yu's image filled the entire display.

After a long moment, her fingers swiped, and a new set of photos appeared.

She tapped open the first photo, which showed Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen with their arms slung around each other's shoulders, taking a selfie in front of the White Dragon High School gate.

The second photo was of Bai Zhenzhen hugging an oversized bottle filled with an energy drink.

The third photo showed Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen sitting back-to-back, surrounded by a circle of drink bottles, with a speechless-looking Song Hailong at the edge of the frame.

The text below read: At White Dragon High School again. The energy drinks here are really potent and delicious. I have to bring back several full barrels every time I come. I'm a White Dragon monthly subscriber, so contact me directly if you want me to bring some back.

The slender fingers once again enlarged the images of Zhang Yu in the photos, lingering for a long time before swiping to the next set of pictures.

This set of photos captured the night view of Songyang City, apparently taken from a tall building in the suburbs.

The center of the shot was the Central Tower, soaring into the clouds as if reaching for the heavens. Not far from it stood the Oasis Tower, currently under construction. Surrounding them were various skyscrapers shimmering with neon lights, which gradually faded into the darker suburban areas… a progression from light to dark that outlined the nightscape of Songyang City.

The text below read: Songyang at 4 AM. You can choose to mess around for 3 years, or you can choose to struggle for 3 years. If you mess around for 3 years, you might have to struggle for the next 100-plus years. But if you choose to struggle for 3 years, ultimately get into a university, and successfully achieve Foundation Establishment, then you can continue to struggle for another 200-plus years.

With a soft chuckle, the slender fingers continued to scroll down Zhang Yu's feed, but just then, a message popped up at the top of the screen.

Lian Tianji: The hallowed first place, are you joking with me? You want me to buy what from Zhang Yu???

Slender fingers tapped rapidly across the phone screen, beginning a reply.

Le Mulan: I'm not joking. Please, I can give you more money.

Transfer 2000

Transfer 2000 accepted

Lian Tianji: This isn't about the money. Besides, you can ask him yourself. Why do you need me to go to him?

Le Mulan: If you're unwilling, I'll just step on your head during class every day.

Lian Tianji: Do you need it delivered by courier or in person?

Looking at Lian Tianji's reply on the screen, Le Mulan nodded slightly.

"As expected, being a bit forceful is more effective when talking to classmates with lower scores than me."

Returning to view Zhang Yu's feed, Le Mulan murmured, "Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, those two poor people are truly inseparable."

However, she was not concerned about this; it was merely an observation made while scrolling through Zhang Yu's posts.

And under the glow of the phone screen, Le Mulan's lips gradually curved into a satisfied smile as she continued to look through Zhang Yu's photos.

"My hard work these past few days has not been in vain. Now when I look at Zhang Yu's photos, I basically feel nothing anymore."

"Next, I just have to wait for Lian Tianji to deliver Zhang Yu's clothes."

"Once I get used to the clothes as well, I probably won't feel so uncomfortable when I run into Zhang Yu."

Le Mulan thought to herself that then would be the time to face the poor Zhang Yu directly and completely overcome the weakness in her heart.

…

In the cafeteria.

Bai Zhenzhen's mind kept replaying the message Lian Tianji had just sent to Zhang Yu.

And as Zhang Yu brought the newly purchased meal to Bai Zhenzhen's table, his mind was once again contemplating talking to Zhen about the illegal tutoring.

He, however, failed to notice the peculiar glint in the way Bai Zhenzhen was looking at him.

After the meal, Zhang Yu said to Bai Zhenzhen, "Zhen, come with me to the rooftop. There's something I want to talk to you about."

So, the two of them went to the rooftop.

This was one of their secret training bases within the school. Over the past few days, they had shed countless beads of sweat here, witnessing each other's growth.

Arriving here again today, Zhang Yu spoke first, "Zhen, there's something I want to tell you. You can probably sense that I've been earning a little money recently, right?"

_I can more than sense it, I freaking saw the message from your client!_

Hearing Zhang Yu's words, Bai Zhenzhen's expression turned slightly bitter, and her heart jolted in shock.

_Is Yu-boy going to tell me the secret of his recent earnings? His secret with Lian Tianji?_

Bai Zhenzhen knew that every year, some high school students, under financial pressure, walked down this path.

Some people looked down on these students who were willing to sell themselves for the pursuit of the Immortal Dao, thinking, why should poor people even try to cultivate? Others admired them, believing they possessed a strong Dao heart for pursuing the Immortal Dao.

But Bai Zhenzhen had never expected that Zhang Yu would also walk down this path, and that he would walk it right up to Lian Tianji.

_Yu-boy, you've gone too far. I can't keep up._

_And if you were going to do it, why Lian Tianji? He only made it to the top eight in the martial arts tournament. He's not worthy of you._

_Couldn't you find some real top students? Even if you went to Song Hailong… no, Song Hailong's body tempering is too high, the medical fees probably wouldn't even cover the damages._

_If it were Le Mulan paying, even I, your mother, would be more accepting!_

Although her mind was racing, Bai Zhenzhen quickly regained her composure.

She controlled her expression as best she could and said slowly, "So what you want to talk about… is related to how you've been making money recently?"

Zhang Yu nodded and said, "Yes, I have a way to make money that I want to bring you in on. The place is in the far suburbs. I've been there many times, and it seems to be fine…"

Bai Zhenzhen's expression changed abruptly, her face scrunching up like a bitter melon as she looked at Zhang Yu, thinking, _Yu-boy wants to pull me into this line of work too?_

At this moment, Bai Zhenzhen found herself completely unprepared. Her first reaction was to refuse.

Thinking of this, she couldn't help but look at Zhang Yu with a hint of admiration.

_Yu-boy's grades are already better than mine, yet after school, he's earning money in another field, 'tutoring' at Lian Tianji's place, working hard to save up cultivation resources. I admit my Dao heart is not as strong as yours. You win this time._

She took a deep breath and patted Zhang Yu's shoulder, saying, "Thanks, my good brother, but really, you don't have to. A good money-making path like this, you should just enjoy it yourself. I haven't reached that step yet."

"Lian Tianji's body tempering isn't low either. Be careful not to get injured and end up at the clinic."

Zhang Yu was puzzled. "What does Lian Tianji have to do with this?"

Bai Zhenzhen sighed softly, turning her head away with a look of resignation.

"This afternoon, I accidentally saw the message Lian Tianji sent you."

"But don't worry, I turned off your phone screen for you. Only I saw it. Qian Shen, Zhao Tianxing, and the others don't know."

"I will keep this secret for you."

Zhang Yu frowned and took out his phone. The moment he saw Lian Tianji's message, he felt like smashing the device.

"Devil incarnate! This devil incarnate! I thought of Lian Tianji as a friend! And he's got his mind on me?"

Then Zhang Yu thought of Bai Zhenzhen's recent behavior and quickly explained, "Nothing happened between him and me!"

He held up his phone screen to show Bai Zhenzhen his chat history with Lian Tianji. 

"Look, it's perfectly clean. Nothing happened."

Bai Zhenzhen unconsciously let out a sigh of relief, then asked curiously, "Then why does Lian Tianji want to buy your worn clothes?"

"Who the hell knows what's going on in his head?" Zhang Yu viciously picked up his phone and began to reply. "First I'll ask him what he's offering. My response will depend on the price."

Unconsciously, Zhang Yu had grown more and more accustomed to the lifestyle of Kunxu, developing the habit of reacting differently to different numbers.

Bai Zhenzhen also watched from the side with curiosity.

On the phone screen, Zhang Yu typed: What price?

Lian Tianji: Any piece of clothing you've worn will do. 2,000.

Bai Zhenzhen said from the side, "Try asking for 5,000."

After Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen waited for a moment, they saw that Lian Tianji had sent a reply agreeing to the price.

Bai Zhenzhen laughed beside him. "Haha, you can earn 5,000 that easily?"

But Zhang Yu still felt strange. "What is he going to do with my clothes?"

Bai Zhenzhen patted Zhang Yu's shoulder and said, "This is 5,000 for one piece of your clothing. Who cares what he plans to do with it?"

Zhang Yu's eyes lit up. "Right, I almost forgot what I was telling you. I wanted to introduce a money-making opportunity to you today."

Just then, the doll that had been quietly staying on Zhang Yu's chest, silently disguised as a black prayer bead, began to speak.

The doll's voice entered Zhang Yu's mind, reminding him, "Zhang Yu, I warned you. In this business, the most important thing is to trust no one. Even a son can betray his own father. Are you sure you want to tell the woman in front of you?"

Zhang Yu, however, said to Bai Zhenzhen without any hesitation, "Zhen, have you heard of the dark world of tutoring?"

After Zhang Yu's explanation, Bai Zhenzhen finally understood that the money he had been earning recently was from tutoring.

For a moment, Bai Zhenzhen's expression became complicated.

Good news: her son wasn't selling his body.

Bad news: her son had joined a gang and was working a job more dangerous than robbery.

Bai Zhenzhen was, after all, a proper, poor, high-achieving student from a key high school. Not only did she respect copyrights, but her reverence for corporations had been ingrained in her since childhood.

Now, hearing that Zhang Yu wanted to bring her into a gang, she also became a little nervous.

"Is this really not dangerous? If we're discovered by the corporations, won't we be captured and forced to be work-slaves for life?"

Zhang Yu explained, "I had the same worries as you at first, but after I went, I discovered that the Dark Learning Gang is a legitimate, large gang that pays taxes according to the law and has all its members worship the gods. If you work part-time, you only need to worry about teaching. We don't need to consider things like fighting or killing."

"And the pay is really good. I can make 6,500 an hour there."

At this point, Zhang Yu paused, then added with some helplessness, "Besides, in this Kunxu… it's too hard for poor people like us to earn money in legitimate businesses. Only a place like the dark world of tutoring can give us a relatively decent income and a better chance of getting into a top 10 university."

When Bai Zhenzhen heard '6,500 an hour,' she felt her heart race, and she suddenly understood why some people joined gangs.

And when she heard Zhang Yu's final lament, she nodded in even greater agreement, thinking to herself, _That's right. For poor people like us, if we don't do something that involves risking our necks… how can we climb up?_

So Bai Zhenzhen also nodded firmly and said, "Okay, I trust you. Just tell me what you want me to do."
