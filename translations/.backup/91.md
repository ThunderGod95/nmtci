# Chapter 89: The Dark Side of Kunxu

The large number that came from the doll’s mouth made Zhang Yu’s heart skip a beat, a flicker of desire in his eyes. He was desperate to make more money right now.

After all, in Kunxu, money was potential, a future, and power. Without it, he couldn’t even pay next month’s loan interest. A poor man had no sense of security whatsoever.

The doll continued its persuasion.

“Besides, this matter isn’t as risky as you think.”

“The only reason you feel it’s dangerous is because of corporate propaganda, which constantly drills ideas like ‘never make an enemy of the corporations’ and ‘the consequences for opposing the corporations are dire’ into your mind.”

“The dark world of tutoring has its reasons for existing…”

Only after listening to the doll’s subsequent explanation did Zhang Yu gain a deeper understanding of the situation.

The major corporations had an iron grip on the first layer of Kunxu and could even petition the Eight Ministries of Righteous Gods to help them investigate all sorts of information.

But not every place in the world was under their absolute control, nor was there a lack of powers capable of obscuring the probes of the Eight Ministries of Righteous Gods.

“The poorer the place, the more destitute people there are, the fewer cultivators you find—that’s where the infrastructure is the worst. There are barely any surveillance cameras, making it the easiest place to evade corporate oversight.”

“As for the Eight Ministries of Righteous Gods and the municipal government, which of the large gangs doesn't pay taxes according to the law and maintain a pious faith? They have righteous gods watching over them all the same.”

Zhang Yu was speechless.

“Pay taxes and be piously faithful, and that gives you a license to break the law?”

The doll stated it as if it were obvious. “Pay taxes and be piously faithful—and you still can’t break the law?”

“Furthermore, every major gang is backed by other large corporations. Gangs are just one of the tools corporations use against each other. After all, the Ten Great Sects may monopolize Kunxu, but the corporations beneath them… they still have to compete.”

“Gangs are the corporations’ chamber pots; they have their own space to exist.”

“Listen to me. If you were an ordinary first-year high school student, I would never recommend this, but you’ve mastered a level 10 cultivation technique. You’re perfectly suited to hide your identity and do some illegal tutoring!”

“Besides, we’re in the same boat now. If you get into trouble, I’ll suffer right along with you. Why would I trick you?”

In the past, Zhang Yu had heard some vague rumors about gangs, but this was the first time he had heard so much inside information.

And though it all sounded plausible, Zhang Yu still couldn't bring himself to fully trust the evil god before him. He sent a message to Zhang Pianpian, asking her about the dark world of tutoring.

Zhang Pianpian: Why did you suddenly think to ask about this?

Zhang Yu: A friend of mine mentioned it. I’m short on cash, aren't I? Just looking for a way to make some money.

Zhang Pianpian: Mmm, taking first place in the martial arts track does give you a certain amount of capital.

Zhang Pianpian: Go to this address and give it a try. If you can do it, do it. If you can’t, just keep building up your strength.

Then, a video call from Zhang Pianpian came through.

After Zhang Yu accepted, he saw her draw a talisman with her fingertips, and a concealment talisman shot through the network and settled upon his head.

Zhang Pianpian: “Alright, this concealment talisman will prevent others from discerning your background for twelve hours, helping you hide your identity.”

“Beyond that, if you want to conceal your face and figure, you can also try using that Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi you’ve recently learned.”

Zhang Yu watched the process of Zhang Pianpian drawing the talisman with curiosity and asked, “This skill of drawing a talisman through the net—what faith level do you need to achieve that?”

“Don’t even think about it right now. Just focus on the task at hand.”

After hanging up, he looked at the address Zhang Pianpian had sent. It was a place nearly seventy kilometers from the center of Songyang City—the remote outskirts of an already remote suburb.

Mulling over Zhang Pianpian’s words, a thought stirred in Zhang Yu’s heart.

_Sis knows about the dark world of tutoring, but she doesn’t seem to think I’ll be able to land a gig?_

_Is it because she doesn’t know I already have several level 10 cultivation techniques, so she thinks I won’t be able to make it in the dark world of tutoring?_

Zhang Yu’s trust in Zhang Pianpian was, without a doubt, greater than his trust in the doll.

He glanced outside. The night was deep, and the glow of neon signs hung high in the sky. It was the perfect time to head out, and he even had a concealment talisman to mask his identity.

_But if I’m going into the dark world of tutoring, I really do need to hide who I am. Sis said I could try using the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi?_

At this thought, Zhang Yu’s eyes shifted.

_Does she mean I should control my muscles to alter my appearance?_

Just as Zhang Yu was pondering how to use the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi to change his appearance, the doll hanging from his neck exclaimed in surprise, “You have such a powerful woman looking out for you? To be able to draw a talisman through the network, her skill in talismans is quite high.”

Zhang Yu ignored the doll, instead attempting to shift the muscles in his face.

With his mastery of Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi at level 10, his control over his body’s musculature had already reached a peak he had never before imagined; he simply hadn’t realized he could use this ability to change his appearance.

With a slight effort, he saw his reflection in the mirror transform dramatically. From elegant and handsome, he became utterly ordinary. After extending control over all the muscles in his body, even his height seemed to shrink. He looked like a complete and total stranger.

…

More than half an hour later, the closer Zhang Yu got to the location, the worse the infrastructure on the roads became. When he was still more than ten kilometers away, even the bus stops disappeared.

Zhang Yu had no choice but to rely on his own two feet to run the rest of the way. Fortunately, with his current physical conditioning, he was neither slow nor easily tired.

But along this path, the buildings grew shorter and the roads rougher. The side alleys were pitch-black and silent, with barely a light to be seen.

Zhang Yu felt as if he had journeyed from a futuristic metropolis to a dilapidated county town.

Compared to this place, Zhang Yu felt his own rented room could be considered luxurious.

Seeing such a quiet night made him feel a little out of place.

_That’s right. The people who live around here are all mortals, so nighttime is naturally for sleeping._

Sleep. The word was gradually becoming a distant concept for Zhang Yu, and for a moment, he felt a wave of wistfulness.

_But it’s precisely because this place is poor enough that it lacks surveillance and management. The corporations are unwilling to invest much in construction here, which must be what gives the gangs room to survive._

He continued onward. Just as Zhang Yu felt his body begin to warm and a light sweat form, he finally arrived at the location on the address.

An imposing gate, cars frequently entering and exiting, a security booth by the entrance, and a sign that read ‘Songyang North Moon High-Tech Service Industry Park’… all of it was completely different from the dark, damp gang headquarters Zhang Yu had imagined.

Zhang Yu said, surprised, “This is the territory of a gang involved in illegal tutoring? It looks far too legitimate.”

The doll said, “They pay their taxes and are piously faithful. They are a legitimate gang, after all.”

Zhang Yu frowned, having never imagined the words ‘gang’ and ‘legitimate’ could be used together.

Zhang Yu asked doubtfully, “Shouldn’t gangs be all about fighting and killing, skulking in the shadows?”

The doll let out a soft laugh. “The ones you’re talking about are the low-level thugs at the very bottom, disposable tools to be used and thrown away. Success in this world is about money and connections. If all you know is how to fight and kill, you’ll end up dead on the street sooner or later.”

The doll seemed to know this world like the back of her hand.

“You see this service industry park? This is the Dark Learning Gang’s turf. They specialize in illegal tutoring, cracking and modifying cultivation techniques, distributing pirated arts, and all sorts of other business. The corporation backing them is the Deep Sea Education Group.”

Zhang Yu was surprised yet again. “The Deep Sea Education Group?”

He remembered that the tutoring center his predecessor had found was registered under the Deep Sea Education Group’s name.

Zhang Yu asked, confused, “I thought the Deep Sea Education Group was an educational conglomerate that develops its own cultivation techniques and runs tutoring centers. Why would they support the Dark Learning Gang?”

The doll laughed again. “Isn’t it obvious? They aren’t the only company in the education business. The Dark Learning Gang is the tool they use to crack their rivals’ cultivation techniques, assist with experiments on those techniques, and strike at hostile gangs… In short, it’s a tool for doing all their dirty work.”

As they spoke, Zhang Yu had already walked into the park. Following the address Zhang Pianpian had provided, he found the number plate of a small building.

Along the way, the park’s security guards were polite and the roadside scenery was pleasant. Zhang Yu couldn't see a single thing that suggested this was a gang’s territory.

Looking at the small building before him, Zhang Yu pushed the door open. After a moment’s thought, he followed the phrasing Zhang Pianpian had taught him and said to the receptionist, “I’m here to offer a class.”

The receptionist smiled. “Of course, sir. Please wait for a moment in room 105. Our sales representative will be with you shortly.”

Zhang Yu walked in the direction the receptionist indicated. As he passed several rooms, he heard the faint sounds of arguments from within.

“Damn it… To sell this one martial art, two of my brothers were fined into bankruptcy, and another was dismembered and sold off by a corporation, and you’re still trying to lowball me?”

“You dog-eyed bastard, getting fierce with me won’t do you any good. These are the gang’s rules. This is the price for offering a level-seven class.”

“Rules! Rules! When I went to smash the Golden Class Gang’s operations by myself, I took out sixteen of their underground tutoring centers single-handedly! Why didn’t you talk to me about rules then? Now that I’m old and can’t learn anymore, you want to talk to me about rules…”

Sensing that someone was approaching, the door to the room was shut, and Zhang Yu could no longer hear the commotion inside.

After entering room 105 and waiting for a short while, a well-mannered, middle-aged man walked in, closed the door, and asked politely, “How can I help you, sir?”

Just then, the doll’s voice echoed in Zhang Yu’s mind.

“Tell him I have a batch of classes to offer, and that he should inspect the goods first. You don’t understand the local gangs. Do as I say. Don’t let him take you for a rookie. Let me handle the price negotiations for you; I can definitely earn you more.”

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback, not expecting the doll to be able to transmit her voice directly into his mind.

But he felt there was nothing wrong with what the doll wanted him to say. He decided he would use the information the doll provided to guide his conversation with the man.

Zhang Yu lowered his voice and said, “I have a batch of classes to offer. You can inspect the goods first.”

With a tremor, streams of milky-white astral qi surged from Zhang Yu’s body, instantly transforming into a swirling mist that enveloped him.

It was the level 10 Limitless Cloud Hand.


# Chapter 90: Fast-Learning Martial Arts

When the middle-aged man saw Zhang Yu display a level 10 Limitless Cloud Hand, a trace of respect entered his eyes.

“Level 10 Limitless Cloud Hand… Such high-quality goods are a rare sight indeed. Impressive, most impressive.”

In the middle-aged man’s mind, anyone who could cultivate a combat art like Limitless Cloud Hand to level 10 had to be at the peak of Qi Refinement. It would require money, leisure, and the dedication to study such a practical martial art after graduating from high school.

After all, most people believed it was impossible for someone to neglect their Dao heart, mana, and physical body just to raise Limitless Cloud Hand to level 10.

Anyone with the time to raise Limitless Cloud Hand to level 10 would most likely have pushed their other attributes to the absolute limit of the Qi Refinement stage as well.

The man thought to himself, _He might be a martial arts teacher from one of the high schools, secretly moonlighting for some extra cash._

However, he had no intention of digging deeper. Prying into the secrets of others was the biggest taboo in this line of work.

The middle-aged man spoke again. “I’ll need to register your information, if you don’t mind. Just a few questions.”

Seeing Zhang Yu nod, the man asked, “Are you looking for part-time or full-time work?”

Zhang Yu: “Part-time.”

The middle-aged man: “And what is your teaching experience?”

The doll’s voice sounded in his head. “Tell him you have ten years of teaching experience. Trust me on this.”

Zhang Yu considered it for a moment. Since he was hiding his identity anyway, he said, “Ten years of teaching experience at a key high school.”

The middle-aged man nodded slightly, as this confirmed his initial guess. He made a note and continued, “Do you have any areas of specialty?”

Under the doll’s guidance, Zhang Yu was gradually getting the hang of how to answer.

“I specialize in teaching cultivation techniques. Besides the Limitless Cloud Hand, I have many other level 10 arts.”

The middle-aged man asked another question. “In your classroom, how do you typically improve student engagement and focus?”

Zhang Yu: “The most basic method is to make underperforming students kneel during class while the top students ridicule them. Different performance in the classroom is met with different treatment.”

The middle-aged man nodded in satisfaction and then asked, “Are you willing to accept clients with relatively low intelligence?”

Zhang Yu was taken aback by the question.

“Relatively low intelligence?”

The middle-aged man gave a helpless smile.

“We are, after all, targeting the lower end of the market. The students who buy our classes are generally average, with a combined score below 450 across the six subjects. Their intelligence isn't high, so teachers need to be exceptionally patient and speak in very simple terms. It's quite different from teaching at a key high school.”

_Good grief,_ Zhang Yu thought, resisting the urge to roll his eyes. _So in your view, students and graduates from regular high schools are just idiots?_

He nodded and said, “I’m very good at teaching slackers.”

The middle-aged man added, “Also, our clients here are quite poor, so teachers are tasked with promoting financial services. Would you be open to that?”

Zhang Yu frowned. “Financial services?”

The middle-aged man smiled. “Things like promoting tutoring loans, installment plans for course fees, that sort of thing…”

Seeing Zhang Yu’s silence, the man smiled again. “No matter. As long as your teaching quality is exceptional, it’s fine even if you don’t promote financial services.”

Then the middle-aged man asked, “During a tutoring session, if you are attacked by corporate security teams or other gangs, are you willing to participate in the fight? And if you fight, are you willing to kill?”

Zhang Yu fell silent at the question, thinking to himself that this was indeed the dark world of tutoring. A teacher had to consider combat and killing on top of their lessons.

To his slight relief, however, the man was at least considering his feelings by asking if he was willing. It showed a sliver of morality, at least.

The middle-aged man continued, “We understand your hesitation. After all, fighting and killing can be costly. But please rest assured, according to the rules of the Dark Learning Gang, we will reimburse you for any and all fines and compensation fees incurred from fighting or killing during a tutoring session.”

Zhang Yu retracted his feeling of relief. So they just thought the price wasn't right. Gang warfare was that mundane to these people?

Naturally, Zhang Yu couldn’t agree to such terms. Although he had several cultivation techniques at level 10, his mana and physical strength were still at the level of a first-year high school student. He wouldn't dare take part in any gang fights.

Hearing Zhang Yu’s refusal, the middle-aged man nodded in understanding. After another series of questions and answers, he smiled at Zhang Yu.

“I’ve recorded all the necessary details. However, what kind of classes we can arrange for you and how we price your courses will have to be decided after your trial lesson.”

The so-called trial lesson was an opportunity for Zhang Yu to teach a sample class, after which the Dark Learning Gang would determine his course assignments and pricing based on his teaching quality.

The middle-aged man added, “...Although your Limitless Cloud Hand is formidable, the market for pure combat arts isn’t as large as the market for health, academic, and work-related techniques.”

The man was concerned that this ‘suspected high school teacher’ might be limited by his experience teaching at a key high school and wouldn’t be able to accurately grasp the demands of the lower-end market.

So, the middle-aged man continued, “Of course, I’m not saying that Limitless Cloud Hand is bad. There will certainly be people willing to pay to learn it. It’s just that our clientele is often more interested in more foundational techniques…”

Hearing his words, Zhang Yu was suddenly reminded of the rankings he had seen when purchasing cultivation techniques online.

Zhang Yu spoke. “The Health-Preserving and Sickness-Dispelling Art, Excavator Palm, Crane Claw, Sports Car Legs… these have a larger market?”

The middle-aged man smiled faintly. “Indeed, the demand for tutoring in those types of techniques is the highest. Although the fee per student is lower, a single class can often accommodate dozens, or even hundreds, of students at once. In the end, they earn more than high-end, small-group courses like Limitless Cloud Hand.”

“Besides those, there are the basic high school cultivation techniques, such as Freehand Combat, Basic Swordsmanship, and Basic Breathing Exercises.”

Hearing this, Zhang Yu’s eyes flickered as a thought took shape in his mind.

_Excavator Palm and Crane Claw have the biggest market? Perhaps I can use the Feathered Tome’s specialization to raise these arts to level 10 in a short period and then teach them._

The middle-aged man continued, “Let’s schedule a time for the trial class, then. I still need to arrange for teachers to observe. Are you free in five days?”

After a quick mental calculation, Zhang Yu nodded. “No problem. Five days from now is fine.”

The middle-aged man asked again, “Besides Limitless Cloud Hand, what else do you plan to teach during the trial class? We’ll need to arrange for teachers who have studied in that area to observe and give you a rating.”

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _The Health-Preserving and Sickness-Dispelling Art is an expert-level technique. It’s not cheap, it involves the entire body with complex movements, and it likely won’t be fast to master._

_On the other hand, advanced-level techniques like Excavator Palm, Crane Claw, Sports Car Legs, and Elevator Leap are inexpensive and have simple forms. They should be much faster to learn, just like a martial art like the Dragonback Mountain Toppler Hand._

To be on the safe side, however, he mentioned fewer than he planned.

He said, “In addition to Limitless Cloud Hand, I can also teach Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs.”

This demonstrated he could teach both high-end and low-end classes. The middle-aged man smiled and nodded.

“We look forward to your performance in five days, then.”

“Oh, by the way, would it be convenient for you to leave a method of contact?”

After confirming that Zhang Yu was unwilling to leave his phone number, the man said, “In that case, could I trouble you to download a game called Kun Shen World? Add me as a friend, and we can discuss course details in the game from now on.”

…

On the way out of the park.

The doll couldn’t help but ask, “You’ve practiced Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs as well?”

She found it impossible to imagine that a student from a key high school would practice such blue-collar arts.

She had originally thought that Zhang Yu could leverage his level 10 Limitless Cloud Hand to sell some high-end, small-group classes.

She never expected that he would also plan to teach low-end, large-group courses like Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs.

Zhang Yu opened a shopping website on his phone and, while purchasing Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs, said casually, “I’ve never practiced them, but five days is enough time for me to learn.”

Zhang Yu knew that since he would be spending every moment with the doll from now on, certain things would be impossible to hide.

The doll frowned. “How is five days enough? And even if you do learn them, with all the teachers from the dark world of tutoring in the Dark Learning Gang, how can you possibly compete with them when you’ve only been learning for five days?”

“You should stop messing around with all this and just focus on teaching Limitless Cloud Hand.”

Zhang Yu naturally paid no mind to the doll’s skepticism. With the purchase of Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs, his account balance dropped by another 3,500, leaving him with a little over 12,000.

After returning to the unfinished building, Zhang Yu immediately began to practice his newly acquired cultivation techniques.

First up was Excavator Palm.

This palm art was a power-based technique that mimicked an excavator, allowing the user to condense a thread of bucket force to dig materials and level ground.

Because it was a purely work-oriented palm technique, containing no combat or body tempering elements, the moves were very simple, consisting of only three: the forward shovel, the reverse shovel, and the sweeping shovel.

Zhang Yu nodded to himself, thinking, _I should be able to run through a full set in just a few seconds. This ought to be easy to learn._

After briefly scanning the manual, he switched the Feathered Tome’s specialization to this cultivation technique.

He immediately saw his palms striking out through the air, sending forth waves of formless power that seemed to build momentum, only to lose control the next moment and dissipate into the air.

Seeing Zhang Yu standing there, stunned and without any effect after completing a full set of the Excavator Palm, the doll sighed.

“I told you that you were wasting your time. You think you can master this technique in such a short time and compete with teachers who have taught for years? How could you…”

But before she could finish, Zhang Yu, who had been frozen in place, moved again.

This time, as he struck, his palms created a whistling sound, as if a gigantic excavator bucket were actually scooping through the air.

The doll stared, dumbfounded, at the scene.

“Wait… he learned it just like that?”

“He learned it that quickly?”

“And from the looks of it… it’s as if he’s been practicing for a long, long time.”

“Is this the potential I unlocked in this kid? The ability to rapidly learn cultivation techniques?”

But what happened next shocked the doll even more.

In just over an hour, she watched in utter disbelief as Zhang Yu’s Excavator Palm progressed by leaps and bounds. He went from a complete novice who had never learned it before to an expert whose palm strikes flowed like water, looking as if he could level the entire unfinished building.

# Chapter 91: Dark Learning Gang, Trial Class

Inside the unfinished building.

Zhang Yu stood silently in the vast, empty hall, his mind repeatedly replaying the effects of the Excavator Palm after it reached level 10.

_With a single palm strike, my control over the bucket force has deepened. The area I can shovel has doubled, hasn't it?_

Zhang Yu struck out with his palm again. The bucket force whistled through the air as it slowly blasted forward.

_Although this Excavator Palm can unleash tremendous power, its wind-up is too long, and its movements are too slow and clumsy. It’s truly unsuitable for combat._

_If I’m not on a construction site, it’s not very useful._

He shook his head with a sense of helplessness. He knew these blue-collar techniques would do nothing to help his college entrance exam scores.

_It doesn't matter. Sharpening my axe won't slow down the woodcutting._

_As long as it helps me earn more money, wasting some time to cultivate these martial arts is acceptable._

But since he had already cultivated the Excavator Palm to level 10 today, Zhang Yu naturally wouldn’t continue practicing it.

And because the Feathered Tome was still on cooldown, he resumed his practice of the level 10 Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, striving to increase his physical strength.

…

In the blink of an eye, five days had passed.

During these five days, Zhang Yu had not only mastered Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs to level 10, but he had also purchased and cultivated Crane Claw and Elevator Leap to level 10 as well.

Factoring in his expenses for food, transportation, and other costs over the five days, Zhang Yu’s savings had steadily declined. Fortunately, he had taught Song Hailong twice more, which allowed him to keep his savings just above 15,000.

At this moment, after asking Zhang Pianpian for another concealment talisman and altering his physical form with Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, Zhang Yu set off for his trial lesson.

Unlike the last time, when he had to run the final stretch, this time Zhang Yu used the Sports Car Legs technique for his journey.

Mana roared within his body, emitting a low hum like a car engine.

Infused with mana, his feet moved at an incredible speed, his entire body dissolving into a series of afterimages as he sped away.

_Compared to Excavator Palm and Crane Claw, Sports Car Legs and Elevator Leap are far more useful._

He recalled how a level 10 Excavator Palm could shovel twice the amount of material and a level 10 Crane Claw could lift heavy objects with both hands simultaneously… and Zhang Yu felt a sense of speechlessness.

_Just like Excavator Palm, it has a long wind-up and slow movements. It’s not suited for combat, just another laborer's art designed for work._

In comparison, the cost-effectiveness of Sports Car Legs and Elevator Leap was much higher.

As a common technique among couriers, Sports Car Legs channeled mana into the legs to accelerate movement, allowing one to run like the wind. Without the need for a car or an electric scooter, it enabled couriers to navigate the city quickly and arrive at their destinations on time.

Elevator Leap, meanwhile, used mana to constrict the muscles, allowing the body to explode with the force of a coiled spring, generating incredible jumping power. This meant that when couriers faced buildings without elevators, they didn't have to despair. They could simply leap up to the target floor, arriving with the package in hand.

_Speaking of which, this is the first time I’ve ever cultivated a movement technique. This stuff really makes daily life much more convenient._

Thinking of the level 10 effects of these two techniques, Zhang Yu couldn’t help but smile slightly, marveling at their practicality.

A level 10 Sports Car Legs could protect the soles of his shoes with mana, reducing wear and tear and lowering the frequency of needing replacements.

A level 10 Elevator Leap could even convert a vertical high jump into a horizontal long jump, which had helped countless couriers leap over red lights and traffic jams to deliver their goods on time.

At that moment, mana surged from Zhang Yu’s dantian, infusing his legs and waist. With a sudden contraction of his muscles, he leaped into the air, clearing a distance of over twenty meters to soar over the red light ahead.

_With Sports Car Legs and Elevator Leap, I can probably reach my tutoring sessions in about thirty to forty minutes._

_And as my mana grows more abundant and my physical strength increases, my speed and jumping distance will become even greater. I’ll be even faster then…_

The doll hanging from Zhang Yu’s neck witnessed this, her mind still reeling with disbelief.

_Wait…_ the doll thought to herself. _Even if these four martial arts are simple, he raised all of them to level 10 in such a short amount of time?_

_Is this boy's potential really something I stimulated?_

_In that case, I'd fucking love to do it to myself. How in the world did he achieve this?_

Over these five days, apart from cultivating these four new martial arts, Zhang Yu had spent most of his time diligently practicing the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

Unfortunately, without the boost from the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill and with his focus divided, his physical strength had only risen to level 1.98 after five days.

_I really want a Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill. Cultivating without an alchemical enhancer feels like I’m practicing at a loss._

…

He arrived once again at the small building within the park.

The middle-aged man who had received Zhang Yu before was already waiting. Seeing him, he smiled.

“You’ve arrived.”

“Come to think of it, I still don’t know how I should address you, sir.”

Zhang Yu replied casually, “Just call me Ma Yunteng. And you? How should I address you?”

The man replied, “You can call me Black Crow. Now, please follow me. The other teachers are already waiting for you.”

Zhang Yu followed him through a hidden door and into an underground tutoring base. He saw that there were guards stationed almost every five steps, with posts every ten. Security seemed to be everywhere.

However, one could tell from the various tattoos on the guards—phrases like ‘Class Every Day,’ ‘Secret Study,’ and ‘Everyone Tutors’—that they were all members of the Dark Learning Gang.

What struck Zhang Yu as odd was the number ‘0’ displayed above each gang member’s head. He wondered what it could possibly mean.

Suddenly, a guard with ‘-122’ floating over his head ran past, the number continuously changing from -122 to -123, and then to -124.

Finally, Zhang Yu couldn’t hold back his curiosity.

“What do the numbers on their heads mean?”

Hearing the question, Black Crow smiled brightly.

“This is a post-monitoring system developed in cooperation with the righteous gods after the gang underwent corporatization. If you’re away from your post for longer than the allotted time, your pay gets deducted. He’s been docked so much… perhaps he has an upset stomach?”

Zhang Yu’s lip twitched. “Isn’t that a bit too strict?”

Black Crow smiled faintly. “These days, anyone with a bit of ambition is drowning in debt, aren't they? A small pay deduction from work is just a trial all young people must endure.”

Zhang Yu gave an awkward laugh. “Heh, being in this gang really is just like working a regular job.”

Black Crow’s eyes lit up. “Thank you for the compliment. The boss has always been committed to the formalization and corporatization of the Dark Learning Gang. Our future goal is to become a new corporation and expand into the city proper.”

He sighed and added, “After all, if not for the inability to find a good job, how many people would willingly join a gang? Once you’ve joined a gang, your resume is permanently stained. You’ll never have a chance to get into a major corporation again.”

_Good grief… so I get it now,_ Zhang Yu thought. _Gangs are for people who can’t find jobs? This place is a support group for the unemployed, isn't it?_

Black Crow gestured ahead. “The tutoring classrooms are up ahead. Restrooms are to the left and right. Further down the stairs, there are training halls, shower rooms, a cafeteria…”

Just as Black Crow was introducing the facilities, a noisy argument erupted from a nearby classroom entrance.

Zhang Yu turned to look and his eyes first fell upon a poster. It read: **Enroll in the White Dragon Teaching Class and enjoy the academic life of the number one high school all night long. By day, you may be an ordinary student at an ordinary school, but at night, you can become a White Dragon and feel the thrill of your grades soaring.**

Below the poster, a student was complaining, “The teacher is so gentle that underachievers don’t even have to kneel! What kind of White Dragon class is this? I paid money specifically to experience the teaching quality of a prestigious school! What you’re doing here is no different from what I experience at my regular high school during the day…”

Zhang Yu was shocked.

_There are people who pay money to experience the academic life of White Dragon High School?_

But in the next moment, he found his own shock laughable.

_Isn’t it obvious? With my understanding of the obsessed students and parents in Songyang City… if you could pay to experience White Dragon High School’s teaching style, even if it’s just an advertising gimmick, there would definitely be people lining up to hand over their money._

…

Meanwhile, in another classroom.

Several teachers were chatting while wreathed in smoke.

An old man with white hair and a tattoo on his arm that read ‘A Class a Day’ took a deep drag, then exhaled a cloud of smoke from a Dao heart buffer.

The Dao heart buffer, an important drug for enhancing one’s Dao heart, was widely circulated throughout Kunxu due to its highly addictive properties and was often processed into cigarettes, alcohol, beverages, and other forms for consumption.

The old man took a few more puffs before speaking.

“What’s this new teacher like? I heard he might be from a key high school.”

Across from him, a middle-aged woman with a scar on her face said coldly, “What kind of academic prodigies do the key high schools accept? Those students are already rich and smart. A teacher who’s used to teaching students like that—does he know how to teach slackers? Has he ever even encountered a failure who scores below 450?”

“Given the grades of most of our students, if you threw them into a key high school… they’d be considered school traitors. Can he even teach them properly?”

Another man, over three meters tall, was practicing his martial arts with rigid precision. His exaggerated muscles were covered in pinpricks, the tell-tale sign of a body tempering expert.

The towering man snorted. “A teacher from a key high school wants to teach Excavator Palm and Sports Car Legs? Has he ever worked on a construction site? Has he ever delivered takeout? Does he even have the ability to teach them? I mixed concrete on a construction site for eleven years, and you, Che Nu, have eight years of experience delivering food. Is it possible he knows these two martial arts better than we do?”

The old man, however, didn’t share their strong opinions. He smiled. “He is, after all, a master who managed to cultivate Limitless Cloud Hand to level 10. Let’s watch him first before we say anything more.”

A moment later, Black Crow entered with Zhang Yu and introduced him to the group.

“This is Ma Yunteng, Teacher Ma, who is here for the trial lesson today.”

Black Crow pointed to the old man. “This is Cai Tou, who has taught Limitless Cloud Hand.”

“This is Che Nu, level 10 in Sports Car Legs.”

“And this is Da Chan, level 10 in Excavator Palm.”

Zhang Yu understood immediately. The three of them were using nicknames, just like him. They were clearly hiding their identities, and it was possible that even their current appearances weren’t their real ones.

Zhang Yu nodded slightly. “I leave myself in your hands.”

The three-meter-tall Da Chan curled his lip. “Everyone’s time is precious. Let’s just get on with the class.”

Zhang Yu couldn’t agree more. He immediately activated the Formless Cloud-Astral Qi. In an instant, his entire body was shrouded in a swirling mist, giving him the appearance of an immortal.

“Then let me begin by speaking on the Limitless Cloud Hand.”
