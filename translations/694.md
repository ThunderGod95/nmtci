# Chapter 694: Kunxu's 19th Underground Layer - Nascent Soul Sacred Body

As Herald God pondered, 007 sent another message, inquiring about the arrangements for the cryo-sleepers on the Flying Boat.

Herald God: Proceed according to the original plan. Take good care of them. I'll hold you accountable for every single death.

The trio who had attacked the cryo-sleepers during the battle now astonishingly became their protectors.

At that moment, they were just like True Monarch Earth Soul, willing to defend the cryo-sleepers' lives with their own.

They piloted the Flying Boat to rendezvous with other hijacked cryo-sleepers.

Here, the cryo-sleepers would participate in the Righteous Qi Alliance's training, join the Heavenly Demon University's work, and use the powers of the Spirit Realm and Dark Spirit Realm to contact their friends and family, encouraging them to smuggle themselves to the Righteous Qi Alliance.

---

Meanwhile, news of the massive attack on Heavenly Demon University swept through the Spirit Realm like wildfire.

The abduction of over a million Junior College Students sparked widespread panic and outrage. The university's leadership immediately denied the claims, insisting that no more than tens of thousands had gone missing during the conflict.

The university's upper echelons were furious about the reported abduction of over a million Junior College Students.

Many clamored for a brutal retaliation against the Righteous Qi Alliance, demanding the seizure of even more territory and resources. However, such a move was clearly not feasible.

For most, the immediate priority remained mitigating the losses.

Even Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, who typically remained secluded in his laboratory, was forced to divert a fraction of his attention to the crisis.

He entered the Spirit Realm's conference hall and coldly addressed the assembled Nascent Soul True Monarchs: "You have disappointed me. Nascent Souls of Heavenly Demon University, defeated by a group of Rogue Souls?"

"Do you realize how much our stock prices have plummeted? How much the value of our currency has crashed? The staggering losses incurred by our major corporations?"

"Unless you provide all shareholders with a satisfactory explanation, you will collectively bear the consequences."

True Monarch Earth Soul was about to speak when another Nascent Soul True Monarch interjected: "It wasn't due to our lack of strength. The enemy deployed overwhelming forces — peak-tier Nascent Souls who had mastered Immortal Sect Techniques."

Another Nascent Soul cultivator chimed in, "There might even be a Soul Transformation cultivator disguised among them. If I hadn't sensed the danger early, I would have been captured and taken to the Righteous Qi Alliance."

"It's definitely a Nascent Soul cultivator from another university who defected to the Righteous Qi Alliance!"

"What Nascent Soul? I bet it's just some Soul Transformation cultivator from another university stirring up trouble."

Hearing the other Nascent Soul cultivators' remarks, True Monarch Earth Soul thought to himself, "Damn it... They're all exaggerating even more than me! A Soul Transformation cultivator trying to snatch a Junior College Student? Seriously?"

Noticing Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's gaze sweeping over him, True Monarch Earth Soul quickly added, "That's right! The Monsterfolk Nascent Soul cultivator I encountered might be a high-ranking leader from Netherworld University or Celestial Monsters University."

The Nascent Soul True Monarchs all uploaded their combat recordings.

Screenshots of battle footage flashed rapidly before them.

The moment Zhang Yu directly blocked True Monarch Earth Soul's attack drew particular attention, standing out amidst the intense Nascent Soul clashes.

"What a formidable Monkey Demon?!"

"Could this be a monkey from Celestial Monsters University?"

"We should demand accountability from Celestial Monsters University! They must have been infiltrated by the Righteous Qi Alliance."

Grand Void.

Spatial Technology Research Association.

Returning to his laboratory, Zhang Yu looked as if he had just taken a leisurely stroll, showing no signs of having been in a fierce battle.

His Bionic Eye flickered slightly as he browsed the Spirit Realm news.

Initially, reports flooded in from various universities about the Heavenly Demon University being attacked, suffering heavy losses, and causing widespread devastation.

But soon, a mysterious force seemed to emerge, and an invisible hand suppressed these reports one by one.

Immediately afterward, news about the Celestial Monsters University's monsterfolk being infiltrated became viral.

The next moment, a Monkey Demon's photo flashed across Zhang Yu's vision.

"Celestial Monsters University's high-ranking members suspected of joining the Righteous Qi Alliance? Massacre of 100,000 Junior College Students..."

"Warning: Righteous Qi Alliance scammers may impersonate missing Junior College Students to make contact..."

Zhang Yu froze, thinking, "When the hell did I kill 100,000 Junior College Students? Are they trying to pin this on me and Celestial Monsters University?"

Lady Fortune chuckled, "Celestial Monsters University only has one Soul Transformation cultivator. Who else would they bully?"

Zhang Yu watched as the Monkey Demon's wanted poster gained increasing traction, particularly fueling discussions about monsterfolk discrimination. This immediately sparked heated debates among various factions in the Spirit Realm.

During this period, Celestial Monsters University repeatedly issued announcements denying any connection to the Monkey Demon, suggesting it was an impersonation using some kind of technology. However, these attempts to suppress the controversy quickly failed.

As for the original Heavenly Demon University's discussions about cryo-sleepers and junior college students, they were completely drowned out by the uproar.

Just then, Yu Xinghan approached Zhang Yu to discuss ongoing engineering projects.

"By the way, have you seen the news?" Yu Xinghan asked. "The Monkey Demon news — he single-handedly attacked Heavenly Demon University and killed a hundred thousand junior college students! His power is truly earth-shattering."

Yu Xinghan marveled, "And that video of him withstanding the Heavenly Demon Reorganization Technique at full power from a Nascent Soul member... So formidable, truly formidable. Could such a Great Monster have joined the Righteous Qi Alliance?"

Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "Don't believe everything you read in the news," he said calmly. "This is just propaganda from Heavenly Demon University to cover up the truth."

Moments later, Zhang Yu returned to his office.

His office was more like a cultivation chamber, with various cultivation materials neatly arranged. It was far larger than his dormitory room at Myriad Laws University.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu had already logged into the Dark Spirit Realm.

Unlike the Spirit Realm, where heated discussions revolved around monsterfolk, Monkey Demons, and Celestial Monsters, the Dark Spirit Realm was rife with topics about Heavenly Demon University exploiting cryo-sleepers, illegally trading Corpse Components, and excessively shortening cryo-sleepers' lifespans.

All the debates, insults, and flame wars were focused squarely on Heavenly Demon University.

Even Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, whose name was taboo in the Spirit Realm, was relentlessly mocked and ridiculed in the Dark Spirit Realm, her image twisted into countless insulting memes.

Junior College Students from across the region flooded the forums with messages, declaring their intent to escape the Ten Greats' jurisdiction and smuggle themselves into the Righteous Qi Alliance.

Smuggling services sprang up to meet the demand.

Zhang Yu discovered that the Righteous Qi Alliance had been secretly supporting these smuggling operations all along. By controlling the skies, they guided Junior College Students from the Second Layer to the Third Layer.

After sequentially observing the situations in the Spirit Realm and the Dark Spirit Realm, Zhang Yu could not help but sigh with emotion. Although they existed in the same overall world, the focus and topics of discussion in the two places were completely different, as if they were two separate worlds.

Just then, a message arrived from the Herald God: Fortune God, you have a remarkably powerful subordinate.

A significant portion of an Evil God's power manifests through their believers. Zhang Yu's recent performance had clearly elevated Fortune God's standing and perceived strength in the eyes of other Evil Gods.

The presence of such a formidable monsterfolk subordinate particularly stirred the Evil Gods' imaginations, leading them to suspect that Fortune God had deeply infiltrated Celestial Monsters University.

Fortune God: What's my reward?

Herald God: Rest assured, I keep my word.

During this exchange, Fortune God felt his authority within the Righteous Qi Alliance rapidly increase. In an instant, he ascended from apprentice to disciple, then from disciple to steward, and finally from steward to Branch Master, climbing three ranks in one breath.

Simultaneously, a massive surge of Evil God Power flooded toward Lady Fortune, who frantically absorbed it.

Though Fortune God had long held the status of a Second-Tier Evil God, she had never possessed sufficient Evil God Power to fully unleash her potential.

Now filled with a massive influx of Evil God Power, Lady Fortune felt her power surge dramatically. She could now accomplish far more in both the Spirit Realm and the Dark Spirit Realm.

"Excellent," Lady Fortune said with satisfaction. "I like Evil Gods who pay handsomely and promptly."

Herald God: "As long as you complete the tasks I assign you, you'll find I've always been generous."

Herald God: "Do you have any comments about Celestial Monsters University?"

Fortune God: "No comment."

Unfazed by the Fortune God's reluctance to volunteer information, the Herald God simply smiled and replied, "My colleagues, the Alliance Leader, and I are all keenly interested in you."

Herald God: "We'd like to invite you to participate in a major event in the future."

Fortune God: "What event?"

Herald God: "The plan to detonate and fragment Kunxu's Fifth Layer."

Herald God: "Completing this task will delay the Heavenly Court's progress by at least another year."

Herald God: "If you perform exceptionally well, I can personally grant you ten of the hundreds of Small Worlds that will splinter off from the Fifth Layer."

Herald God: "When these Small Worlds reorganize into the 19th Underground Layer of Kunxu, you'll become the new Great Landlord, laying the foundation for your reign as an Evil God King."

In the Herald God's view, the temptation he offered was enough to make any Evil God work themselves to the bone for him.

After all, financial freedom, freedom in cultivation, and ultimately becoming a comfortable Evil God King — that was the ultimate dream of countless Evil Gods.

On the other side, Lady Fortune was indeed shaken by the Herald God's words. After ending their communication, she felt a pang of heartache.

"This pie in the sky is so delicious, but I can't have it... I can't have it!"

Lady Fortune knew that everything the Herald God had said had nothing to do with her.

Kidnapped by Zhang Yu, her only path forward was to charge toward the sect alongside him.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu was stunned by the information revealed in the Herald God's words: "The Fifth Layer can be transferred below? To become Kunxu's 19th Underground Layer?"

Lady Fortune sighed. "Theoretically, it's possible. After all, Kunxu's spatial structure is artificial. If it could be created in its current form, then altering the layer numbers... theoretically, it's indeed possible."

"In fact, as far as I know... the space in Kunxu's 18 underground layers has been silently expanding. But where this expansion comes from remains a mystery..."

The topic was too distant for Zhang Yu and Lady Fortune, so after a brief discussion, they shifted their focus to gathering intelligence. Zhang Yu realized that to prevent the Fifth Layer from being detonated, the Ten Great Universities and the Righteous Qi Alliance would inevitably engage in an unprecedented final battle there.

Zhang Yu's initial purpose in coming to the Dark Spirit Realm was to collect information from the Righteous Qi Alliance about Void Soil.

Now, leveraging Lady Fortune's authority as a Branch Master within the Righteous Qi Alliance, Zhang Yu gained access to the Intelligence Section and immediately saw a wealth of previously inaccessible data and information become available to him.

"Although there's no direct information on Void Soil reserves or storage locations..." Zhang Yu thought to himself as he reviewed the intelligence, "by analyzing battlefield reports, the Righteous Qi Alliance's current factory information, transportation networks, trade records... and piecing together these scattered clues, I can still roughly determine where Void Soil is likely produced and stored."

Zhang Yu understood that Kunxu's Immortal Dao industry chain followed logical patterns. Many factories were interconnected in upstream-downstream relationships, adhering strictly to the most rational, optimal, and profitable operational layouts.

Moreover, the Ten Great Universities already possessed considerable intelligence on the Third Layer's original layout. What they lacked was information on the Righteous Qi Alliance's operational methods within the Third Layer.

Zhang Yu understood that he didn't even need to analyze the data himself. By simply handing over this intelligence to the Ten Great Universities, their experts would naturally be able to make accurate deductions.

"So... who should I give it to?" Zhang Yu mused inwardly. "Who's most eager to seize the Righteous Qi Alliance's Void Soil right now?"

Having obtained a wealth of data and information from the Righteous Qi Alliance, Zhang Yu couldn't simply deliver it himself. Given his current status, such an act wouldn't earn him any merit; instead, it would likely arouse unnecessary suspicion.

Originally, Zhang Yu had planned to use his Divine Spiritual Root's stealth capabilities, combined with the Evil God Ritual's concealment techniques and the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture's shapeshifting abilities, to stage a theatrical "leak" of Righteous Qi Alliance intelligence on a battlefield, thereby allowing the Ten Great Universities to acquire the information.

However, with Lady Fortune's Evil God Power surging dramatically, she could now conceal her presence in the Spirit Realm and disseminate anonymous messages, simplifying Zhang Yu's next steps considerably.

---

Heavenly Demon University.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's gaze flickered as lines of information scrolled across his Bionic Eye.

"Someone sent intelligence about the Righteous Qi Alliance to the university's complaint mailbox?"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus knew that such intelligence would initially be dismissed as false rumors. The fact that it had reached his attention meant it had likely already been verified.

"The Righteous Qi Alliance's industrial chain layout? Hmm... Can we locate Void Soil?"

A flicker of battle intent flashed in Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's eyes.

Simultaneously, other Soul Transformation cultivators at Heavenly Demon University and the university's top administrators began sending him messages.

After the Righteous Qi Alliance abducted a million university students, Heavenly Demon University's leadership had been consumed by rage, determined to retaliate and reclaim their losses.

The current scarcity and exorbitant price of Void Soil only intensified their desire for profit.

The entire university transformed into a massive war machine, its gears grinding into motion.

But just as Heavenly Demon University was preparing, probing, and silently clenching its fist like a slumbering giant gathering strength, news arrived that Divine Monarch Great Devourer of Celestial Monsters University had single-handedly stormed the enemy's ranks.

---

Kunxu's Third Layer.

On the fierce battlefield, a colossal dragon shadow, as massive as a mountain, streaked across the sky, its body laden with production lines, factories, warehouses, laboratories...

This dragon shadow was none other than Divine Monarch Great Devourer of Celestial Monsters University.

Several Soul Transformation figures pursued her, engaging in a running battle. Dragon scales and blood erupted from her body in bursts, yet not a single piece of her spoils fell to the ground.

"Mine... mine... all mine..."

Divine Monarch Great Devourer gnashed her dragon teeth, refusing to relinquish her loot despite the relentless attacks.

Even the drops of dragon blood that fell to the ground transformed into monsterfolk, who immediately began plundering the surroundings and hauling their stolen goods back to the dragon's body.

Divine Monarch Treasure Flow, who was leading the pursuit, couldn't help but admire her tenacity. "No wonder she achieved Soul Transformation. Great Devourer's reproductive capacity must be the highest among the Ten Universities, and few can match her transportation skills."

"To counter this Mother Dragon's theft and plunder, we'd need at least three Soul Transformation cultivators to contain her."

"And if we ignore her..."

Divine Monarch Treasure Flow had no doubt that given enough time, she could completely strip the Righteous Qi Alliance bare.

---

Zhang Yu watched the news from the Spirit Realm.

First came the Divine Monarch Great Devourer's solo assault on enemy lines, followed by the Heavenly Demon University leading a massive army to launch a long-range attack on multiple Righteous Qi Alliance strongholds in the Third Layer.

The first batch of As-You-Wish Size Rings, both large and small, were deployed in actual combat by the Heavenly Demon University, significantly boosting their war efficiency.

After the Celestial Monsters and Heavenly Demon sects took action, the other major universities swiftly mobilized, initiating a large-scale plunder of Kunxu's Third Layer.

The course of the war was being heavily influenced by the technology and intelligence Zhang Yu provided.

As Zhang Yu observed, the price of Void Soil continued to plummet as the war progressed, falling... falling... and falling further.

The Spatial Technology Research Association naturally received a massive allocation of Void Soil for their experiments.

---

In the Spirit Realm, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's projection flickered as she glanced at True Monarch Thunder Pole, her junior brother. She frowned slightly and asked, "What is it?"

True Monarch Thunder Pole inquired, "About the Research Association... Do you think the amount of Void Soil allocated to Zhang Yu is excessive? Does he really need that much for his experiments?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole replied calmly, "Zhang Yu is already the top young talent at Myriad Laws University, a future leader, and possesses an Immortal Sect Technique. If we don't invest in him, who should we invest in? Besides, he's deeply devoted to the University."

True Monarch Thunder Pole had long grown accustomed to hearing Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, Divine Monarch Greenwood, and others praise Zhang Yu. Yet he couldn't shake the feeling that his senior sister was excessively indulgent toward this disciple.

Just then, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole continued, "Thunder Pole, Azure Void sent you to ask this, didn't he?"

"Tell him that Zhang Yu played a crucial role in his achieving Soul Transformation. He shouldn't forget that... Don't let petty gains make him stingy."

"And you — you're already hundreds of years old, yet you're still being used as a pawn. I truly don't know what to say about you..."

---

Meanwhile, having secured a substantial supply of Void Soil, Zhang Yu once again immersed himself wholeheartedly in his cultivation, focusing particularly on the Immortal Sect Daoist Art, the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier.

Zhang Yu believed that by raising this daoist art to Level 40, he would master a technique capable of fundamentally altering the course of the war.

Whether he sought to join a sect in the future or exert his desired influence on the world, this mastery was crucial.

"Back on Earth," Zhang Yu mused, "perhaps the way to change the world was like Brother Dao's approach — uniting the lower and middle classes to overthrow the elite, then fighting upward step by step. That's what they call 'the most righteous way to seize power,' the most orthodox method for transforming the world."

"But Kunxu is entirely different..." Zhang Yu sighed inwardly. "Whether it's the Immortal Dao or science, both demand pragmatism, adapting to circumstances as they arise."

"In Kunxu, where supreme power reigns and individual strength can shake the world, changing the world means climbing to the top, becoming the strongest force in the entire system, and reshaping it according to one's will."

"Change from the top down... this might be the most righteous, and certainly the most practical, method for transforming the world in Kunxu."

"The weak can't even glimpse the full scope of Kunxu, let alone know their true opponents..."

"I must join a sect, become stronger, wealthier, and master more Immortal Dao Technology..."

After experiencing one event after another, Zhang Yu unconsciously developed a deeper desire to change the world.

He no longer simply wanted to join a sect because of the Evil God Ritual's compulsion.

To climb higher, Zhang Yu needed more Immortal Dao resources, and the Spatial Technology Research Association presented a once-in-a-millennium opportunity.

"By leading the Research Association's development, controlling vast funding, and influencing countless industries, I can accelerate my cultivation progress."

Beyond the Level 40 Immortal Sect Technique, Zhang Yu understood the importance of his own hard power. Whether it was his basic stats, the levels of his cultivation arts and magical artifacts, he had much room for growth.

Time flowed steadily as Zhang Yu focused on his cultivation.

Before he knew it, a month had passed.

---

Zhang Yu's gaze shifted to the data displayed on his Feather Book.

Dao Heart: Level 35 (52.78%)
Magic Power: 33,936 units
Physical Strength: Level 35.66

Based on these three fundamental metrics, Zhang Yu knew that within two months of breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, he had already reached the Mid-Stage Nascent Soul realm.

In addition to the two mental cultivation techniques that had already reached Level 40, ten Body Refinement Techniques had also reached Level 40, contributing to the completion of his Nascent Soul Sacred Body.

Nascent Soul Sacred Body

Initial Stage - Nascent Soul Sacred Body (6/6): Doubles the distance the Nascent Soul can separate from the body. This effect persists even when switching to another Chain Method Diagram Set.

Advanced Stage - Nascent Soul Sacred Body (8/8): Doubles the enhancement effects of cultivation arts empowered by the Nascent Soul. This effect persists even when switching to another Chain Method Diagram Set.

Ultimate Stage - Nascent Soul Sacred Body (10/10): Doubles the cultivation efficiency and effectiveness of all Nascent Soul cultivation arts.

It was precisely these enhancements from the Nascent Soul Sacred Body that allowed Zhang Yu's cultivation progress to continue its explosive growth.

Furthermore, Zhang Yu's military-grade magical artifacts, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God and the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword, had been refined to Level 31, reaching the Nascent Soul standard.

"My research team lacks a Nascent Soul powerhouse to oversee things," Zhang Yu mused. "Yan Qianji and the others can only refine magical artifacts to Level 30 at best. If it weren't for True Monarch String Tone's assistance, we wouldn't have reached Level 31 at all."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Once my influence grows, I'll need to recruit some Nascent Soul experts to help."

As for the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, Zhang Yu knew that unless Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole personally took the time to refine it for him, he would have to wait until he could do it himself. After all, Myriad Laws University had only acquired this military-grade magical artifact recently, and few had studied it.

In the next moment, Zhang Yu spread his hands, and an invisible barrier unfolded between his palms.

The Level 21 Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier activated, creating a spatial barrier within Zhang Yu's grasp.

"As the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier levels up, the range of the spatial barrier expands, and the casting speed increases."

"But even a Level 40 Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier couldn't possibly create the sky-sealing formations currently blocking each layer."

Having advanced this Immortal Sect Technique to Level 21, Zhang Yu's mind was flooded with related knowledge and key points, as if he had been practicing it for years.

He speculated, "The Righteous Qi Alliance must be using formations to seal the sky."

"Some of them have likely been secretly practicing this Immortal Sect Daoist Art for a long time, researching its underlying technology."

Just then, a message from Magnetic Pole appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: I've reviewed your latest design blueprint.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: Well done.

Over the past month, Zhang Yu had mastered the basics of the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier. After reaching Level 11, he activated the powers of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology and the Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart, combining them with existing magical artifact blueprints to create a new design.

This design included a Spatial Storage artifact that utilized space-folding technology.

It also featured a magical artifact capable of temporarily generating a spatial shield, representing a further advancement in spatial barrier technology.

Whenever Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole reviewed Zhang Yu's design blueprints, she couldn't help but sigh, "That Zhang Yu always manages to create exactly what I've been wanting to design."

Since leading the Research Association, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had developed various products, including Flying Boats that utilized spatial technology and Spatial Locks to confine opponents.

Zhang Yu's designs, however, always felt like the projects she had been meaning to tackle but hadn't yet found the time for.

Especially in the realm of spatial technology, he consistently stayed one step ahead, providing her with invaluable inspiration.

"Is this due to the influence of the Immortal Sect Technique?" she mused inwardly. "Each advancement in the Immortal Sect's cultivation art grants him deeper insights into spatial technology."

At that moment, Zhang Yu saw the message from Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and immediately asked: Are we releasing them now?

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: Yes, everything's nearly ready. It's time to unveil some new products.
