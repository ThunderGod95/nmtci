# Chapter 602: You've Lost

Kuang Tianqing, locked in combat with Bai Zhenzhen, suddenly narrowed her eyes, sensing something had locked onto her.

A split second later, a black streak flashed across the sky, piercing Kuang Tianqing's body in an instant.

"A... flying sword?"

Evading the strike with the Heavenly Demon Void Technique, Kuang Tianqing's Bionic Eye scanned the fleeting black shadow, her brow furrowing. "Reinforcements from the Heavenly Sword sect?"

"Hmph, you think a single flying sword can stop me? How utterly naive."

Bai Zhenzhen surged toward Kuang Tianqing again.

As the two clashed, the flying sword darted back in, only to be grazed by Bai Zhenzhen's sword qi.

With a resounding crash, the flying sword shattered into countless fragments. Yet these shards didn't halt; instead, they continued their assault on Kuang Tianqing like a meteor shower.

Kuang Tianqing's brow arched. "The Ten Thousand Mile Meteor Sword... Wen Wuyai's military-grade flying sword?"

The shattered fragments of the flying sword relentlessly stabbed at Kuang Tianqing, repeatedly piercing her body. This forced her to constantly evade the relentless assault using the Heavenly Demon Void Technique.

"To defeat the Ten Thousand Mile Meteor Sword, you must either eliminate the flying sword master controlling it or completely vaporize the sword in one strike."

"Otherwise, even shattering it repeatedly will only cause the sword to splinter into an increasingly fine swarm of flying swords..."

However, Kuang Tianqing couldn't locate Wen Wuyai's position at the moment, making it impossible to eliminate the flying sword master.

While Kuang Tianqing possessed the ability to vaporize the Ten Thousand Mile Meteor Sword in one strike, such a high-intensity attack required her to gather her strength and seize the precise moment during the sword's high-speed flight.

However, Bai Zhenzhen was attacking her relentlessly, leaving her no opening to execute such a move.

Instead, Bai Zhenzhen's repeated shattering of the Ten Thousand Mile Meteor Sword only amplified its offensive power, forcing Kuang Tianqing to repeatedly activate the Heavenly Demon Void Technique to evade the attacks. This further reduced her chances of destroying the sword.

Faced with an opponent who was nowhere to be found, forcing her into constant passive defense, Kuang Tianqing couldn't help but feel a surge of frustration. "That Wen Wuyai..."

"Kuang Tianqing..." Wen Wuyai observed the battlefield, thinking to herself, "Long-range combat is my domain."

"Entering this domain, your defeat today is inevitable."

At the same time, Wen Wuyai messaged the school team group chat: "Hey, you two still not here yet?"

Heavenly Sword University's 3rd-ranked Feng Xingyao: "Coming, coming!"

Heavenly Sword University's 4th-ranked Yu Yunzhan: "If you'd give us more control over the Sky-Patrolling Flying Swords, we could be there faster."

Wen Wuyai ignored the last remark, her gaze fixed on Kuang Tianqing's position within the battlefield. She thought to herself, "The establishment of super-long-range strikes means Heavenly Sword can now concentrate our forces and provide mutual support at any time."

"Kuang Tianqing, what will you do now?"

On the battlefield, Kuang Tianqing watched two more flying swords streak across the sky, piercing the air like twin straight lines as they hurtled toward her. Her brow furrowed deeper.

"They're so fast."

"Then there's only one option..."

Just as a resolute glint flashed in Kuang Tianqing's eyes, signaling a decision, a brilliant golden Buddhist light erupted in the sky. A colossal golden figure, hundreds of meters tall, strode onto the battlefield, joining the fray.

Simultaneously, a resounding Buddhist chant echoed through the atmosphere.

The figure boomed, "Hey, look at these combatants! How badly injured are they?"

"What can we do about such severe wounds?"

"Bring them to the Shedding Flesh Pavilion!"

"Recycle your old Bionics and old fleshly bodies that you no longer use. The Shedding Flesh Pavilion offers on-the-spot recycling, immediate inspection, and instant payment..."

Kuang Tianqing's frown deepened. "Vajra University scum."

"Hmph, so Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen must have already called for reinforcements in their Four-School Group, then."

As Kuang Tianqing had predicted, the moment Zhang Yu encountered the strongest student from Heavenly Demon University, the top-ranked competitor in the Ten Greats League, he immediately marked his approximate location and sent it to the Four-School Group chat.

His plea for reinforcements was simple:

"We're ganging up on Kuang Tianqing! She's almost down!"

Naturally, few believed him, but students nearby couldn't help but be curious.

Jin Napan, the second-ranked student from Vajra University, arrived early to observe the battle.

However, he refrained from intervening, lacking confidence in securing any gains from the conflict.

It wasn't until reinforcements from Heavenly Sword University began arriving that Jin Napan finally emerged, letting out a loud shout.

His theatrical entrance, complete with a dramatic announcement, stemmed from his awareness that the entire arena was being live-streamed.

As the strongest student from Heavenly Demon University and a frontrunner for the Ten Greats League championship, Kuang Tianqing was naturally a prime target for live broadcasts.

"At this very moment, tens of millions of viewers are likely watching Kuang Tianqing's battle."

"The advertising effect at this moment must be phenomenal."

With the arrival of Vajra University's second-ranked student, Kuang Tianqing's battle intent rapidly receded, as if she had no further desire to continue.

She cast a cold glance at Zhang Yu before her figure shot away, vanishing from sight in an instant.

As Kuang Tianqing departed, the tense atmosphere in the air immediately began to dissipate.

However, Bai Zhenzhen, still enveloped in black sword qi, let out a furious roar and lunged after Kuang Tianqing.

Zhang Yu quickly intercepted her. "A-Zhen! Don't chase after her!"

As the black sword qi threatened to strike him, Zhang Yu said, "A-Zhen, it's me."

"I'm okay."

"Look at the video I recorded."

"Kuang Tianqing didn't devour me."

As he spoke, Zhang Yu stepped forward and slowly embraced Bai Zhenzhen.

"It's alright now, A-Zhen."

"It's alright."

After a long while, the black sword qi gradually dissipated, and a flicker of joy appeared on Bai Zhenzhen's face.

"Yu Zi, are you really alright?"

Zhang Yu looked at Bai Zhenzhen's smile and smiled back.

Just as the atmosphere began to relax, a figure suddenly burst from the earth, appearing behind them.

It was Kuang Tianqing, who had returned after retreating!

"Just as I suspected," she sneered. "The moment I withdrew, you'd deal with Bai Zhenzhen's problem."

"This is my best chance to attack you."

Kuang Tianqing glared coldly at the embracing pair and unleashed a palm strike aimed at Zhang Yu.

"Zhang Yu is severely injured — now's my chance to ambush him."

"Once I capture Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen will inevitably chase after me, leading her away from this place..."

But in the next instant, as if anticipating the attack, Zhang Yu whirled around and unleashed a palm strike imbued with the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. Simultaneously, the earth beneath their feet transformed into chains of a magical artifact, sweeping toward Kuang Tianqing.

The Heavenly Sun Radiance God erupted from behind, roaring with flames.

The flying swords that had retreated into the sky earlier returned to strike again.

Nearby, Jin Napan joined the assault, launching a deadly attack on Kuang Tianqing.

Kuang Tianqing, witnessing this scene, felt a jolt of alarm. Just as she was about to retreat, Zhang Yu charged directly into the palm strike she had launched at him.

"He's practically throwing himself into my hands?"

A surge of greed momentarily clouded Kuang Tianqing's judgment, preventing her from letting this "opportunity" pass.

But the instant her palm struck Zhang Yu, she felt as if she had slammed into the outer shell of a military-grade magical artifact.

"Huh?!"

Kuang Tianqing was stunned, never expecting that the severely wounded Zhang Yu could still possess such formidable defensive capabilities.

"Of course you wouldn't expect it", Zhang Yu thought grimly, sensing the surprise in her eyes. "With my Civil Engineering Holy Body, A-Zhen's earlier sword strike entangled me in relentless sword qi, constantly draining my physical body to its absolute minimum."

"Yet it is precisely in this state that my defensive capabilities reach their peak."

Attacks are reciprocal. Just as Kuang Tianqing's palm struck Zhang Yu, the violent collision of Magic Power and Gang Qi made her realize she was about to face Zhang Yu's counterattack.

Kuang Tianqing remained unfazed, confident that her cultivation level would prevent Zhang Yu from inflicting any real damage with a single strike.

A deafening explosion reverberated through the air.

Kuang Tianqing's expression suddenly twisted in shock.

Black sword qi erupted from Zhang Yu's hand, piercing straight into her chest.

A hairline crack appeared on her chest Bionic.

Though the fissure was microscopic and barely affected the Bionic's function, it marked the first genuine injury she had sustained that day.

"It's Bai Zhenzhen's sword qi," she realized. "He seized the opportunity to release a strand of it from his body."

"And... it struck precisely at a weak point in my Bionic, maximizing its effectiveness."

"Has this man been waiting for me here all along? Did he anticipate my ambush?"

Zhang Yu coldly regarded Kuang Tianqing, his gaze sweeping over the multiple weak points on her Bionic highlighted by the Treasure Appraisal Manual.

Though far from comprehensive, Zhang Yu had managed to identify several vulnerabilities in her military-grade Bionic during their earlier clash.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Kuang Tianqing, you're the epitome of a Kunxu native. How could you possibly pass up an opportunity for a sneak attack?"

Zhang Yu had not only anticipated Kuang Tianqing's high likelihood of ambushing him, but he had also just sent a message in the Four-School Group chat, alerting everyone present. This coordinated effort had led to the current encirclement.

As Kuang Tianqing met Zhang Yu's unwavering gaze, she felt his astonishing fighting spirit, sensed the reinforcements closing in from all sides, noticed the hairline cracks appearing on her Bionic, and detected the distant sounds of approaching reinforcements...

At that moment, trapped under the assault of six opponents, a genuine urge to retreat finally surfaced in her heart.

"If I continue fighting and get injured, I'll give Dao Qiankun an opening. My chances of winning first place in the Ten Greats League will diminish."

"Hmph, consider yourself lucky this time."

Before the encirclement could fully tighten, Kuang Tianqing sneered, transformed into a wisp of dark shadow, and withdrew.

"Immortal Scum, I take back my previous assessment."

Retreating rapidly, Kuang Tianqing glared coldly at Zhang Yu and said, "You're worthy to be my slave."

"Next time, I'll capture you myself."

Watching Kuang Tianqing's figure vanish in an instant, Zhang Yu laughed. "Kuang Tianqing, what are you still pretending for?"

"To refine Bai Zhenzhen into a flying sword, how much information about your daoist arts did you expose this time?"

"Not only did your plan fail, but I also damaged your Bionic."

"You've lost!"

In the live broadcast watched by tens of thousands of people, Zhang Yu shouted, "Kuang Tianqing! You've lost this battle!"

"You're the one running away now!"

"What are you pretending for?!"

Kuang Tianqing whipped around, her gaze piercing through Zhang Yu, who was now a shrinking black dot.

"Clinging to life... If Bai Zhenzhen weren't by your side, do you think you'd still be alive today?"

"Immortal Scum... within three days, before this team competition ends..."

"I will definitely capture you and refine you into my toy."

With those words, Kuang Tianqing never looked back, her figure completely disappearing from the crowd's sight.
