# Chapter 423: The Soaring Value of Jade Nectar Coins

This Military Certificate Examination was held in the wilderness, on a plain over a hundred kilometers from Myriad Laws University City.

Due to the strict secrecy surrounding the exam's content and location, Zhang Yu had relied entirely on his Bionic Eye's guidance to reach the site.

Upon arriving at the candidate waiting area, he found six other examinees already present, bringing the total to seven.

The Military Civil Engineering Certificate exam doesn't attract many candidates, Zhang Yu mused. After all, it requires a recommendation.

His arrival quickly drew the attention of the six other candidates. Their gazes held a hint of surprise.

Zhang Yu? A mere third-year student... What's he doing here? Su Yanyang thought, clearly believing Zhang Yu, who had just entered his third year, was unqualified to compete for the Military Certificate.

Xiao Yunji, standing nearby, glanced at Zhang Yu before dismissing him. The other students followed suit, evidently seeing him as no real competition.

Unfazed by their opinions, Zhang Yu found a seat and quietly focused on sensing the power within his body, preparing for the upcoming examination.

After the final exams, Zhang Yu devoted himself to rigorous cultivation, single-mindedly pushing himself to the limit. Finally, after enhancing his Magic Power and Physical Strength, he also elevated his Dao Heart to Level 20, the peak of Foundation Establishment!

Moreover, his Magic Power Quality had reached 197%, drawing ever closer to the Foundation Establishment limit of 200%!

Beyond these fundamental improvements, Zhang Yu's greatest progress lay in his cultivation arts.

The Treasure Appraisal Manual, Earth Manipulation Divine Transformation, and Primordial Magnetic Meridian Severing Hand had all reached their peak at Level 20!

The Azure Lotus Sword Embryo's retention effect on the Chain Formation Diagram had also improved. The University Holy Body and Civil Engineering Holy Body now retained 10% of their power, while the Martial Dao Holy Body retained 6%. Only the Outstanding Meridian Prolongation Flow remained at a shorter duration, retaining just 4%.

Sensing the boundless power surging within him, Zhang Yu gazed at the parameters of the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch, Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill, Earthly Fiend Bottle, Earth-Suppressing Seal, and Golden Thread Jade Wall displayed in his Bionic Eye, and an overwhelming confidence surged through him!

Moments later, all the examinees felt a tremor in their Bionic Eyes, as if a faint radiance were emanating from the distance.

They instinctively looked up toward the light and immediately recognized the eighth-ranked examinee, Ping Han!

Ping Han's chest pulsed with a red light, displaying the fluctuating number 13.25 — the current price of a Jade Nectar Coin!

Behind him, a graph floated, charting the coin's steadily rising value over the past six months.

Projected onto his back, arms, abdomen, and thighs were countless figures of men, women, and children — the avatars of the Jade Liquid Divine Monarch from Joyful Union University.

Beneath these projections, several students gazed enviously at Ping Han's state-of-the-art Bionic.

Su Yanyang was among the envious, but his envy burned with resentment.

His jealousy intensified when he spotted the three metallic crates hovering behind Ping Han, his heart twisting with envy.

The Hundred Treasures Box's intelligent magical artifact management system, Su Yanyang thought bitterly. Does he really need three just to store his artifacts?

Seeing Ping Han's teeth-to-toe armament, some students began to lose heart, convinced they couldn't possibly compete with him in this examination.

Just then, the number on Ping Han's chest flickered upward, rising from 13.25 to 13.26!

Ping Han chuckled, reading the group message displayed in his Bionic Eye.

"Did everyone see the news? The Jade Liquid Divine Monarch is holding a lottery for Dual Cultivation!"

"Just spend Jade Nectar Coins to enter, and if you win, you get to Dual Cultivate with the Jade Liquid Divine Monarch for a full day and night!"

"Teacher Pinghan, how long do you think the Jade Nectar Coin will keep rising?"

Ping Han: This is just the beginning.

Ping Han: I've said it countless times — the Jade Nectar Coin will definitely surpass 1,000 Spirit Coins in the future.

In recent days, Ping Han's group had been growing rapidly. The membership fees alone had earned him a substantial number of Spirit Coins!

Watching his former classmates — especially those who had advised him against trading coins or refused to lend him money for it — come crawling back to ask about the Jade Nectar Coin, their pride swallowed as they begged for his help, filled Ping Han with immense satisfaction.

He mused inwardly, "After years of painstaking cultivation in the Coin Dao, my time to finally rise above and soar has arrived!"

As Ping Han chatted with members of his guidance group, the 13.26 on his chest flickered to 13.27, then quickly jumped to 13.28!

Watching the Jade Nectar Coin price on Ping Han's chest climb relentlessly, Zhang Yu couldn't suppress the urge to buy some himself!

He quickly suppressed the impulse, repeatedly warning himself against rash action.

Meanwhile, Su Yanyang stared at Ping Han's chest, muttering inwardly, "Damn it... has it gone up again?"

"Good thing I bought some too!"

As he watched Ping Han's profits soar and the Jade Nectar Coin's value climb relentlessly, Su Yanyang meticulously researched every aspect of the cryptocurrency. He finally reached a conclusion:

"This isn't just market manipulation. The Jade Nectar Coin's rise is driven by a confluence of structural tailwinds — the start of a long-term bull run!"

After purchasing the coin and watching his account balance swell, Su Yanyang only regretted not investing sooner.

"Ah, my Dao Heart still isn't sensitive enough. I missed opportunities to accumulate even more Immortal Dao potential!"

As Su Yanyang silently lamented his missed chances, Xiao Yunji, standing nearby, frowned slightly and averted her gaze, refusing to let the numbers on Ping Han's chest disturb her composure.

Having seen so many of Ping Han's profit screenshots, Xiao Yunji had naturally considered investing in the Jade Nectar Coin herself.

But after consulting Director Lin and her family elders, she received unanimous disapproval.

As Xiao Yunji watched the Jade Nectar Coin's value skyrocket, a flicker of doubt arose in her mind. "Were Director Lin and the others too cautious? Did they make a mistake?"

"After all, the Jade Nectar Coin was created by a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch. How could Golden Core or Nascent Soul True Monarchs possibly comprehend its true potential?"

"No, the immediate priority is to pass the Military Certificate Examination!"

Xiao Yunji suppressed her wandering thoughts, resolving to focus entirely on securing the certificate.

Though Ping Han's strength had surged dramatically, Xiao Yunji remained confident in her chances of obtaining the Military Certificate. She had prepared for this for years — she couldn't possibly give up now!

Meanwhile, after finishing his conversation with the group chat, Ping Han's gaze fell upon Zhang Yu.

"What are you doing here?" Ping Han asked, surprised.

"Director Gao recommended me for this Military Certificate Examination," Zhang Yu replied calmly.

Ping Han paused, a strange glint in his eyes, but said nothing.

A surge of resentment welled up within him.

He remembered how he had painstakingly seized his immortal fortune, only to be thwarted by a mere lack of Spirit Coins from soaring to new heights.

He remembered kneeling before Director Gao, desperately begging for Spirit Coins, only to be denied and miss out on a lucrative cryptocurrency boom. In the eyes of many, he had become a failure.

Yet Zhang Yu, a mere junior, had been handed a recommendation for the Military Certificate Examination by Director Gao, a privilege he would surely squander. Ping Han's heart burned with resentment. "Gao Chongguang, you'll regret this!"

"I'll show you how wrong you were!"

Just then, thunder rumbled across the sky!

Everyone looked up to see a Flying Boat descending over the examination grounds.

---

Onboard the Flying Boat, Director Gao stood silently at the railing, his gaze sweeping over the examination grounds below. A mysterious light flickered in his eyes.

He was here today as a guest for Myriad Laws University's Military Certificate Examination, his presence lending authority to the event.

Many other distinguished guests were present, including experts and professors from the Civil Engineering Departments of other universities.

Having attended similar events before, Director Gao knew that the results of such a crucial examination couldn't be determined solely by Myriad Laws University's internal decisions.

In addition to the expert professors from various universities serving as witnesses, three Righteous Gods would oversee the fairness of the examination and provide professional judgment.

Furthermore, the results would be submitted to the Heavenly Court for approval. Only after receiving official recognition and being recorded by the Heavenly Court would the results be considered final.

As Director Gao surveyed the examination hall, Director Lin suddenly appeared behind him, a faint smile on his face. "Ping Han's been quite the star lately!"

Director Gao's gaze sharpened slightly. "What's your point?"

Director Lin sneered. "Your War Faction students ultimately rely on cryptocurrency trading and finance, don't they? Old Gao, don't you think you're being too rigid?"

Director Gao retorted dismissively, "That's none of your concern!"

Yet, when he thought of Ping Han, a hint of helplessness crept into Director Gao's heart.

Judging solely by this Military Certificate Examination, Ping Han, as a War Faction student, was clearly the most likely candidate to secure the certificate.

This should have been good news, signifying that after Mo Jingjin, the War Faction would gain another student capable of wielding the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, completely overshadowing the Peace and Neutral Factions in terms of student strength.

But precisely... Ping Han had achieved this through cryptocurrency trading.

Director Gao wasn't entirely opposed to Miraculous Coins; he himself held long-term investments in currencies created by Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs for profit.

However, Ping Han's actions, in his eyes, weren't investment at all — they were pure gambling!

Director Gao had witnessed countless instances of such sudden, gambling-fueled wealth in the past, and every single one had ended in utter ruin.

"Ping Han might very well win this year's Military Certificate," Director Gao thought, "but he'll likely go bankrupt shortly after mastering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power..."

He sighed inwardly, "Instead, he's driven the Peace and Neutral Factions' top contenders to the next Military Certificate Examination, where they'll have to compete against senior students and Zhang Yu, a fifth-year student!"

Just then, three figures emerged from the Flying Boat's cabin — the three judges for this year's Military Certificate Examination!
