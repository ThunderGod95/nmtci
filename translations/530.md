# Chapter 530: Hoping for a Master to Become a Dragon and Suppressing Chaos

With the recent economic crisis impacting all sectors, Zhang Yu had initially expected the experiments related to the Soul Transformation Bionic to face delays.

"Counting the days... Master's magical artifact Refining progress hasn't slowed down at all, as if unaffected by external factors."

Thinking this, Zhang Yu couldn't help but marvel at True Monarch Magnetic Pole's unwavering focus and the school's unwavering commitment to the Soul Transformation Bionic project.

"After all, this project is highly valued by the school's Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, right?"

"To remain unaffected during the Soul Transformation conflict, it seems only projects representing the interests of Soul Transformation cultivators could achieve such immunity."

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Zhang Yu eagerly began studying the effects of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology.

Through his active sensing, Zhang Yu gradually gained a deeper understanding of the Encyclopedia's true purpose.

He closed his eyes slightly, and the design blueprints for the Good Fortune Relic appeared in his mind.

"I want to... reduce the manufacturing cost of the Good Fortune Relic."

In an instant, sparks of inspiration seemed to ignite in Zhang Yu's mind, and his thoughts began racing at an unprecedented speed.

Countless fragments of knowledge he had once learned, magical artifacts he had observed, and blueprints he had studied flashed before him like a million lightning bolts, vanishing in an instant.

In the next moment, a brand-new blueprint for the Good Fortune Relic materialized in Zhang Yu's mind.

It was the result of his mind, acting on instinct, instantly connecting, integrating, and applying the vast accumulation of knowledge stored within him.

According to this new blueprint, the cost of the outdated Good Fortune Relic could be reduced by approximately 32%.

Although the old version of the Good Fortune Relic had long been obsolete in the market, this improvement still allowed Zhang Yu to sense the potential of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology.

"The Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology is an ability that allows one to continuously enhance their artifact refinement design skills through learning."

"It stores all the knowledge you've acquired — the things you've studied, the magical artifacts you've observed, the blueprints you've researched — as a foundation."

"When needed, it instantly connects all this information, allowing you to design improved blueprints for magical artifacts, optimizing their fundamental attributes such as weight, manufacturing cost, material strength, and Magic Power storage capacity."

"The more knowledge and blueprints I master, the more powerful the optimizations I can design."

"Especially when it comes to magical artifacts of the same type, the effects are even more pronounced."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "This is an ability that grows stronger with continuous learning and imitation."

At that moment, Zhang Yu felt an insatiable hunger for knowledge.

He also realized, "The more I copy, the stronger I become. So, a teacher with this ability... they probably study numerous similar magical artifacts before attempting to improve their own."

He recalled the Yang Artifact Bionic he had recently refined with his teacher and mused, "My teacher's recent collection must now contain a mountain of design blueprints for Yang Artifacts from various brands and schools."

But the next instant, Zhang Yu's mind reeled with dizziness, and his consciousness grew hazy.

"Are the side effects kicking in?"

Zhang Yu opened his Feather Book and saw his dao heart data fluctuating. It had dropped from Level 20 to Level 19 (86%).

He thought to himself, "Using the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology to instantly design magical artifact modifications, as if by instinct, burns through rationality, causing mental tremors and instability of will."

"The result is a decrease in my dao heart level."

"The more complex the design requirements for the modification, the greater the impact on my dao heart."

"However, this slight decline in my dao heart level should recover quickly, probably within a week."

Although his dao heart level would recover quickly, Zhang Yu now understood that he couldn't recklessly overuse the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology's capabilities.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu had already begun recording the design blueprints in his mind.

He had no personal use for the Good Fortune Relic, and this outdated version likely wouldn't be competitive against the newer models on the market.

It was like trying to optimize a Bionic Eye from ten years ago — no matter how refined, it couldn't match the capabilities of the current generation.

Still, since this relic was a product of his dao heart's efforts, Zhang Yu decided to preserve it.

But as he recorded the new design blueprints, he noticed something strange.

"Hmm?"

"Why can't I quite understand this?"

"Logically, since I've advanced the Good Fortune Relic to Level 20, I should have a deep understanding of all the knowledge and technologies it contains — Spirit Realm transmission technology, in-body sensing technology, and more."

Zhang Yu's mind raced, and every detail about the Good Fortune Relic flooded his consciousness, as if it had been refined countless times, hammered into his very being until he understood it completely.

Yet when he examined the new diagram before him, he found areas he couldn't comprehend.

This wasn't a matter of not knowing how to refine the Good Fortune Relic according to the new design; rather, he couldn't understand why these modifications had been made.

"Why is this happening?"

"It should be based on my thinking, drawing from the knowledge in my mind..."

Suddenly, Zhang Yu froze, a thought striking him: Could it be...? No, that's impossible!

In that moment, he remembered the Supreme Clarity Realm he shared with his sister, and the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo he had copied from Bai Zhenzhen.

Could it be that when I activated the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology to create this new diagram... I drew upon my Master's knowledge?

Zhang Yu stared at the diagram in shock, the more he studied it, the more convinced he became that his theory was correct.

"I just combined my knowledge with Master's... and created this new design!"

Zhang Yu grew increasingly excited at this realization. "No wonder! I knew that even though the Good Fortune Relic was an outdated model, reducing the cost by 32% with the new blueprint was still far beyond my expectations."

"Could this be because my design incorporated Teacher's accumulated expertise?"

"Excellent, excellent! True Monarch Magnetic Pole, you truly are a worthy Master!"

At that moment, Zhang Yu's desire for his Master to achieve greatness soared to unprecedented heights. He fervently wished she would study diligently, preferably mastering every magical artifact in existence.

"I can't rely solely on Master's efforts. I should give her a push and help her upgrade her Dao Seed."

"Not only do I need the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology, but if this could... motivate Master to strive for Soul Transformation, that would be even better."

Zhang Yu understood that achieving Soul Transformation himself would be far easier if his Master reached that stage first, making him a Soul Transformation disciple.

The next day, Zhang Yu visited True Monarch Magnetic Pole's laboratory again, seizing the opportunity to observe the conditions for upgrading her Dao Seed.

"Level 2 Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology... To upgrade further, she needs to refine ten artifact refinement products of Level 30 or higher simultaneously?"

Zhang Yu gasped when he saw the condition. "At my current level, this task will likely take a considerable amount of time to accomplish."

He knew that he had only managed to refine a Bionic alongside True Monarch Magnetic Pole earlier by taking advantage of the Soul Transformation Bionic's presence and acting as a reference material.

Finding ten more opportunities like that wouldn't be easy.

Nevertheless, Zhang Yu remained determined. He believed that with persistence, he would eventually complete the task.

He also grew increasingly eager to experience the effects of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology at Level 2.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole glanced at Zhang Yu, thinking, "Why is this kid giving me such a strange look?"

She turned her head and warned, "Stay low-key during this period. Spend less money, avoid drawing attention, and focus on your studies."

Zhang Yu seized the opportunity to ask, "Teacher, how long do you think this economic crisis will last?"

"Not too long," True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied. "The higher-ups won't let these old fools run wild."

"Even if a full-scale University War breaks out, this chaotic fighting isn't the kind of conflict they want."

"I estimate that once the losses start affecting the interests of those in power... someone will call for a halt."

"In the meantime, stay holed up in your dorm, wait for the storm to pass, and don't get involved in anything else."

On his way back to the dormitory, Zhang Yu received another message from Director Gao.

Director Gao: "Zhang Yu, I need to ask you for a favor."

Director Gao: "The construction site on the 670th floor has become chaotic recently and needs someone to keep order."

With the temporary suspension of construction projects, emergency maintenance of various Formations was also required. In Director Gao's view, Myriad Laws University had already stepped one foot into a state of war.

Under these circumstances, with most ordinary projects halted, many laborers found themselves out of work.

However, the Civil Engineering Department's top talents were assigned to critical positions, responsible for maintaining Formations, Spirit Veins, and defensive fortifications, making them busier than ever.

As a result, construction sites like the one on the 670th floor, lacking strong oversight, suddenly descended into chaos.

This was particularly true because many workers on the site were Foundation Establishment Students who had graduated years ago and only came to take on odd jobs due to recent unemployment. Relying on their seniority and experience, they frequently overstepped boundaries, leading to increased material losses, damaged surveillance equipment, and disappearances of Monsterfolk workers.

When Zhang Yu arrived at the construction site, he witnessed widespread mutual interference, work stoppages, and even workers competing for tasks.

Gazing at the construction site on the 670th floor, Zhang Yu felt a flicker of curiosity. "The construction of the new floors in University City hasn't stopped. Could it be because this project is also of concern to the Soul Transformation cultivators?"

Without further comment, Zhang Yu activated the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. A violent Earthly Fiend Gravity swept across the site, lifting cement, twisting steel, and completing a massive amount of construction work in an instant.

As Zhang Yu silently completed the work with his overwhelming power, the workers on the site gradually became awed by his divine might, becoming obedient and compliant. Under his suppression, order was gradually restored to the site.

During this process, Zhang Yu noticed Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang outside the construction site.

Having failed to secure work inside the site against the graduates, they now squatted quietly outside, their eyes fixed on the busy workers inside with a hint of envy.

Shi Yunxiang's cheeks were sunken, his fur was dry and brittle, and streaks of white had appeared in his hair. His face carried a constant wariness, punctuated by occasional flashes of panic, clearly indicating that he had been through difficult times recently.

Beside him, Ying Xin's Bionic showed clear signs of wear and tear, particularly her right arm, which hung limply at an unnatural angle, as if suffering from a malfunction. She resembled a lame stray dog.
