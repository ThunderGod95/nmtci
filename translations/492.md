# Chapter 492: Mountain-Moving Warrior

With the end of the final exams, Zhang Yu, as in previous years, secured first place in his class. His overall score also propelled him to 23rd place in the entire Civil Engineering Department.

This achievement qualified him for new scholarship loans. His combined ranking — first in his class and 23rd in the department — earned him over 20 Spirit Coins in low-interest scholarship loans.

Although Zhang Yu's income was substantial, his expenses were equally high.

The costs of manufacturing and maintaining magical artifacts, purchasing and practicing artifact crafting blueprints, and cultivating his Artifact Refinement Technique each required resources sufficient to hire multiple Civil Engineering students.

With the addition of these 20 Spirit Coins, Zhang Yu's account balance approached 60 Spirit Coins.

Beyond scholarship loans, high rankings naturally came with other benefits, such as weekly meal distributions and discounts on various school facilities. Zhang Yu had grown accustomed to these perks, even finding them somewhat stingy, though other students regarded them with envy.

Now that his account held more Spirit Coins, Zhang Yu naturally intended to use them to further enhance his Cultivation. After all, improving his Cultivation directly increased his earning potential.

"How can I strengthen my abilities and earn more money without investing?"

Fueled by his ambition to reach the pinnacle of the Immortal Dao, Zhang Yu once again immersed himself in the Artifact Refinement Laboratory.

For him, the immediate priority was to unlock new Military-Grade power. However, this path required him to transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department, a step he couldn't take yet.

Though he couldn't immediately access new Military-Grade power, in Kunxu... even if all his fundamental attributes had reached their limits for his current cultivation realm, as long as he had money... he could always find ways to further enhance his strength.

This was especially true for Zhang Yu, who aspired to master artifact crafting. With enough capital... he could continuously refine his artifact crafting skills while producing more magical artifacts to generate wealth, thereby perpetually increasing his earning potential and advancing his Immortal Dao cultivation.

For instance, on the 669th floor of University City, Ying Xin's grandfather was currently leading Zhao Tianxing, Che Yufei, and other company employees in operating Zhang Yu's magical artifacts for work.

Watching the Earthly Fiend Bottle continuously produce Coagulated Earth under his control, Zhao Tianxing remarked with satisfaction, "I never imagined a Junior College Student like me could be working on Myriad Laws University projects every day."

As he walked through the construction site on the 669th floor daily, especially when operating magical artifacts alongside other students, Zhao Tianxing felt like he had become a student of Myriad Laws University himself.

Leveraging his connections in the Civil Engineering Department and the magical artifacts he provided, Zhang Yu's company secured small construction projects within University City, even when he wasn't actively working.

After deducting employee salaries, taxes, Magic Power consumption for the artifacts, maintenance costs, and Tu Lishan's commission, Zhang Yu still managed to earn 0.1 to 0.2 Spirit Coins daily.

"It's not much... but I don't have to lift a finger!"

Whenever Zhang Yu thought about his employees earning money for him while he conducted experiments in the laboratory, his account balance steadily growing, he found these passively earned Spirit Coins even more satisfying than those he earned himself.

Lady Fortune nodded in agreement. "Home-cooked meals taste better, but money earned by employees tastes even sweeter. Passive income is far more valuable than active income from working a job."

Zhang Yu nodded repeatedly. "Exactly!"

Lady Fortune reminded him, "Thanks to my efforts, the company's profitability has improved recently..."

Zhang Yu replied, "Keep up the good work, President Fortune. Once the company grows, you'll definitely be rewarded. I hope you'll grow alongside the company."

Lady Fortune cursed inwardly, "You bastard... you're just refusing to give me a raise, aren't you?"

While Zhang Yu was shuttling daily between the construction site and the laboratory, Nine Heavens Liu from the Finance Department added him as a friend.

Nine Heavens Liu: Hello, Zhang Yu.

Nine Heavens Liu had added Zhang Yu through True Monarch Celestial Seal.

Looking at this Academic Overachiever ranked first in the Finance Department and second in the entire school, Zhang Yu couldn't help but feel a sense of gravity.

The last student he had seen with such a high ranking was Yan Qianji, who was first in the Artifact Refinement Department and third overall.

Zhang Yu: What do you need?

Nine Heavens Liu: I want to rent your body — just a portion. The exact amount would depend on the test results.

Zhang Yu: What do you mean?

Nine Heavens Liu: I know this sounds sudden, but I'm pressed for time preparing for this year's Ten Great Leagues and need to accelerate my Cultivation.

Nine Heavens Liu: True Monarch Magnetic Pole's Yin Artifact Experiment seems like an excellent opportunity.

Nine Heavens Liu: I want to rent a portion of your body to take your place in the experiment.

Zhang Yu immediately replied: Sorry, I'm not interested.

Zhang Yu knew he couldn't agree. After all, the experiment was his way of laundering his Cultivation. If Nine Heavens Liu took his place, his lies would be exposed at any moment.

Seeing Zhang Yu's immediate rejection, Nine Heavens Liu's eyes flickered with surprise. "Such a decisive refusal?"

Nine Heavens Liu: Aren't you even going to ask about the price?

Zhang Yu: Sorry, I'm really not interested.

Nine Heavens Liu: Zhang Yu, I think you should reconsider.

Nine Heavens Liu: The Yin Artifact Experiment controversy is growing. While being at the forefront has its advantages, the risks are substantial.

Nine Heavens Liu: Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's descent last time was just the beginning.

Nine Heavens Liu: I suggest you secure your gains now and leave with the money, rather than continuing to gamble.

Before Nine Heavens Liu could send further messages, Zhang Yu replied again: I'm really not interested. You don't need to say any more.

Sensing the hint of impatience in Zhang Yu's tone, Nine Heavens Liu paused, then chuckled softly. "Heh, this kid... he's quite greedy."

"Well, let's see how long you can hold onto that position."

"By the time you want to back out, the price might not be the same as it is now."

As Zhang Yu's Spirit Coins dwindled, his account balance dipped below 20.

The scale of Zhang Yu's Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill expanded once more. When mixed with Gang Qi, it further amplified the Gang Qi's power.

The Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual also continued to level up, reaching Level 20. This allowed the Artifact Refinement Prodigy of the Chain Method Diagram Set to complete the second Cultivation Art.

When Zhang Yu attempted to unleash the Gang Qi at the simulated construction site, golden flames erupted, enveloping his body like layers of golden armor.

In an instant, Zhang Yu's body was encased within a five-meter-tall Golden Armor Warrior.

This miniature giant resembled the giant Zhang Yu had previously crafted using the Minor Threefold Combination, but it was far more powerful and refined — essentially an upgraded version of the Formless Spirit General. Zhang Yu named it the Mountain-Moving Warrior.

The Mountain-Moving Warrior's body was formed from Body-Protecting Qi mixed with the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill, resembling a golden puppet radiating a metallic sheen.

Beneath the outermost layer of solid armor lay liquid armor, followed by gaseous armor infused with the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force. This three-state configuration — solid, liquid, and gaseous — provided astonishing defensive capabilities.

In addition to this, layers of dragon scales shimmered across the surface of the outermost golden armor, imbued with Dragon Vein Power after Zhang Yu had reforged it using the Level 20 Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual.

Under the influence of Dragon Vein Power, Zhang Yu's Gang Qi now not only channeled incoming attacks into the earth but also amplified the Formation's buffs and accelerated his Magic Power recovery within the Formation.

Compared to the Formless Spirit General, which had relied on the Minor Threefold Combination for propulsion, the Mountain-Moving Warrior could now be propelled by Zhang Yu's own Gang Qi combined with the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. No longer requiring external materials like mud, sand, or stone, its power, speed, and explosive force had become terrifyingly enhanced.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "According to intelligence reports, the Civil Engineering Department at Immortal Armaments University's most formidable asset is their Giant Military-Grade Puppet."

"My Mountain-Moving Warrior is perfectly suited to confront it head-on, preventing the Giant Puppet from breaching our defensive line."

Just then, True Monarch Magnetic Pole, standing beside Zhang Yu, asked, "Your Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual has truly reached Level 20?"

Zhang Yu quickly replied, "Yes, it has."

"Ever since that Yin Artifact Experiment, I've felt an inexplicable familiarity with the Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual," Zhang Yu added.

Zhang Yu: "Then, as I practiced, I felt myself getting faster and faster, as if I had already mastered it."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole observed the faint dragon scale patterns on Zhang Yu's Mountain-Moving Warrior before saying, "Let's test it."

The test results confirmed that Zhang Yu had indeed reached Level 20 in the Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual, leaving True Monarch Magnetic Pole in awe.

"It's only been half a month, hasn't it? Yet you've already advanced this Artifact Refinement Technique to Level 20?"

"Incredible, truly incredible."

"No wonder the two Divine Monarchs from Joyful Union University progressed through their cultivation so astonishingly quickly, yet remained so secretive about this technique."

"They've likely transferred the cultivation of countless others onto themselves using this method."

"Hmph, some of that cultivation might even be stolen."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power also successfully broke through to Level 20 during laboratory testing, leaving True Monarch Celestial Seal both astonished and delighted.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Good. The stronger you are, the greater your chances of success in tomorrow's competition at Immortal Armaments University."

"Fight well tomorrow, but be prepared to surrender at any moment. Old Gao and I will be watching your match through the Spirit Realm."

The next day.

Immortal Armaments University was located in a bottomless cavern, its entire campus stretching downward along the cavern walls, forming an immense underground city.

Wan Gouxuan, from the Civil Engineering Department, and several of his teammates gathered before their teacher.

The teacher presented them with a series of Bionics, saying, "Zhang Yu has confirmed his participation in the competition."

"Once the competition begins, find opportunities to take turns using these Bionics. Following the methods the Professor taught you, test his physical body and extract every possible material from him, from head to toe."

Wan Gouxuan nodded confidently. "Rest assured, Teacher. The Earth Surge God is in peak condition. I won't give Zhang Yu any chance — I'll just thoroughly fuck him over."

As Wan Gouxuan picked up the Bionic, the humiliation of having his medical insurance blown up by Mo Shangjin last year resurfaced in his mind. He thought to himself, "Mo Shangjin, I'll make your Junior Brother pay dearly for the humiliation you inflicted on me. I'll brand him with the indelible mark of his crushing defeat against Immortal Armaments University."

However, the mention of Mo Shangjin also brought forth Wan Gouxuan's underlying concerns, which he voiced aloud.

The Teacher reassured him, "Rest assured, if Mo Shangjin buys his way back into the competition, we'll naturally provide you with the means to enhance your combat capabilities."

"Your focus should be on seizing opportunities to end this swiftly. Don't give Zhang Yu even the slightest chance to surrender."
