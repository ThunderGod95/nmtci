# Chapter 433: An Involuntary Hum

Su Yanyang and another examinee crowded around Ping Han, peppering him with questions about his cryptocurrency trading strategies.

In their eyes, this senior, who had bided his time before ultimately securing the Military Certificate with Jade Nectar Coins, possessed a wealth of knowledge to learn from.

Ping Han patiently answered their questions, eventually successfully recruiting them into his paid coaching group.

During their conversation, Ping Han subtly inquired about their performance on the examination. Confirming that both had performed poorly and were now out of contention for the Military Certificate.

Next, Ping Han glanced at the dazed Xiao Yunji, thinking to himself, "Xiao Yunji has been acting like this ever since she asked me about the integrity of my formation core. She must have lost to me in that area!"

As for Zhang Yu, who lay nearby covered in blood and gore, Ping Han had never considered this third-year student a serious rival. Seeing Zhang Yu's severe injuries now only reinforced his conviction that the Military Certificate was beyond his reach.

Observing the situation of the other examinees, Ping Han felt 99.9% certain that the Military Certificate would be his.

Though he maintained a calm facade, Ping Han couldn't suppress a surge of excitement. A Military Certificate held immense significance for a student like him.

"With this certificate, I can finally cultivate the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power!"

Feeling the Seven Wonders of Civil Engineering, which he had cultivated for years, flowing within him, Ping Han experienced a profound sense of fulfillment.

"This isn't just about having a better chance at winning the Inter-University League. With the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, my prospects for graduate school and achieving the Golden Core stage will skyrocket. My path to immortality is now clear!"

At that moment, Ping Han felt boundless hope for his future journey on the Immortal Dao. He couldn't help but hum softly to himself.

However, he quickly reined in his excitement, repeatedly reminding himself to steady his Dao Heart and avoid any missteps at this crucial juncture.

"Achieving the Golden Core is merely the beginning. My path on the Immortal Dao stretches far ahead!"

With this thought, Ping Han smiled faintly at Xiao Yunji and said, "Xiao Yunji, one failed exam is nothing to worry about. Why don't you learn about Jade Nectar Coins? They'll greatly benefit your future cultivation!"

Xiao Yunji looked up at Ping Han, noticing that his previous arrogance and fanaticism, born from his cryptocurrency gains, had vanished.

Ping Han was in an excellent mood. He saw Xiao Yunji as a defeated opponent, no longer a threat but rather a stepping stone to his Immortal Dao potential.

Noticing a flicker of hesitation in Xiao Yunji's eyes, Ping Han continued nonchalantly, "How about I send you a file first? You can review it at your leisure, and if you're interested, we can discuss it further."

After sending the file to Xiao Yunji, Ping Han turned to Zhang Yu. "Junior Brother Zhang, would you like to learn more? It could transform you entirely and significantly improve your chances of passing the Military Certificate Examination!"

When Zhang Yu shook his head, Ping Han didn't mind. He figured Zhang Yu didn't have much money anyway and resumed answering Su Yanyang's questions.

While Ping Han and the others were conversing, Zhang Yu received a message from his class teacher, True Person Scorching Thunder:

True Person Scorching Thunder: Director Lin asked me to relay a message to you!

True Person Scorching Thunder: "If you're willing to become his disciple, he's willing to help you navigate the Finance Department and approve a 600 Spirit Coin loan!"

Seeing the number 600 Spirit Coins, Zhang Yu's heart pounded violently, nearly injuring his internal organs again!

600 Spirit Coins? With that much...

Just as Zhang Yu's mind began to wander, another instructor added him as a friend and messaged him: "Zhang Yu, True Monarch Sacred Mountain wishes to take you as his disciple. Are you interested?"

The instructor continued, "The terms are negotiable and will definitely be no less favorable than what others offer!"

True Monarch Sacred Mountain was the head of the Civil Engineering Department, the Nascent Soul True Monarch whom Tu Lishan referred to as the "Old Director"!

Watching the messages brought by Director Lin and the Old Director's messenger, Zhang Yu's earlier excitement over the 600 Spirit Coin loan gradually subsided.

It seems my performance on the Military Certificate Examination has caught their attention!

Even though the Heavenly Court hasn't announced the results yet, they're already convinced I'll pass with flying colors?

After calming down, Zhang Yu didn't rush to accept either Director Lin's or the Old Director's offers. Instead, he left the door open for further consideration and discussion.

As Zhang Yu's gaze casually swept over Ping Han and the others nearby, his mind was already charting his future path.

"Director Lin has the Finance Department backing him. A 600 Spirit Coin loan is a substantial offer, enough to skyrocket my cultivation speed!"

"But the Finance Department isn't for me. It requires connections, networks, and vast capital — not just talent and technical skills. And their methods of exploiting people are too ruthless. Offering me a 600 Spirit Coin loan right off the bat? Who knows how many traps await me!"

Though reluctant to turn down the 600 Spirit Coin loan, Zhang Yu knew he wasn't qualified for the Finance Department's path, even with his Military Certificate.

Then the image of True Monarch Sacred Mountain surfaced in his mind. "Even if the Neutral Faction's development path is viable, the Old Director himself is a walking disaster!"

Having spent considerable time in the Civil Engineering Department, and with the help of well-connected individuals like Tu Lishan and Tingting, Zhang Yu had gathered considerable intelligence.

For example, True Monarch Sacred Mountain was advanced in age and nearing the end of his lifespan, and had been desperately seeking ways to prolong his life for years.

The Old Director was already halfway into the Spirit Realm. If Zhang Yu became his disciple, would he have the time and resources to nurture him in exchange for future returns? He probably couldn't afford to wait for the benefits Zhang Yu might bring him.

He'd likely drain me of all my value the moment I joined, using it to extend his own life!

After a moment's thought, Zhang Yu realized that neither Director Lin nor the Old Director were good choices.

However, just because Zhang Yu didn't intend to pursue these paths didn't mean they were useless.

"Director Gao and True Monarch Magnetic Pole will probably contact me soon too, right? Keeping these options open will help raise my value."

Shortly after, Deng Bingding returned the examinees to Myriad Laws University's University City.

Before they left, Deng Bingding sent them a website link.

"The exam results have been reported to the Heavenly Court. They will complete the approval process within fifteen business days and publish the results."

This website would host the exam results.

Hearing this, Ping Han couldn't help but ask, "What's the fastest it can be?"

Deng Bingding glanced at Ping Han, a hint of pity in her eyes that he barely noticed. "The Heavenly Court is quite busy," she said calmly. "It'll take at least three to five business days."

Shortly after, the group dispersed. Deng Bingding took Zhang Yu to the hospital for a checkup.

"Zhang Yu," Deng Bingding remarked, "I never imagined you'd progress more in less than three years at Myriad Laws University than you did in all three years of high school!"

The two continued chatting amiably until they reached the hospital. After Zhang Yu had a doctor prescribe a bag of medication, he insisted on being discharged immediately.

With my recovery rate, this injury might be severe, but a few days of rest should be enough, he thought. There's no need to stay in the hospital for observation. Old Gao's been through enough — I should save him the money. This bag of medicine will do.

As Zhang Yu slowly walked down a street, he noticed all the shops were closed. The surrounding area was eerily deserted. Looking toward the street's entrances, he saw pedestrians deliberately avoiding the road, as if it were invisible.

As Zhang Yu stood there, bewildered, a figure draped in starlight materialized before him.

"Senior Sister Ye?" Zhang Yu exclaimed in surprise.

Ye Xingli stared at him with an odd expression, then silently produced True Monarch Magnetic Pole's Profound Heavenly Pearl.

In the next instant, a slender figure in ornate palace robes appeared — the very avatar True Monarch Magnetic Pole had previously used to communicate with Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu instantly understood. True Monarch Magnetic Pole's Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Formation had taken control of the street, suppressing all matter intertwined with the Spirit Realm and rendering it invisible to ordinary eyes.

"True Monarch?" Zhang Yu asked.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole telepathed: "How did you do on the Military Certificate Examination?"

After speaking with True Monarch Cloud Haven, True Monarch Magnetic Pole had realized Zhang Yu must have performed exceptionally well, possibly even securing the Military Certificate. This was why True Monarch Cloud Haven had inquired about the results.

Still, True Monarch Magnetic Pole decided to ask personally. Only Zhang Yu could provide the most accurate account of his experiences in the Examination Field.

Zhang Yu sent a message, briefly explaining the situation.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded slightly, replying with satisfaction, "Excellent, excellent! I thought you were just testing the waters, but this is a pleasant surprise!"

After speaking, she gently touched Zhang Yu's wound and sighed softly, "Such a severe injury... why didn't you stay in the hospital longer?"

Zhang Yu replied, "I'm physically strong. A few days of rest will be enough. No need to waste money on hospital bills. True Monarch, do you need anything?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "You're heading back to your dormitory, right? We can talk on the way."

With that, she reached out and pulled Zhang Yu into her arms. "You're quite heavy. Don't wander around on your own. I'll carry you back."

Ye Xingli, standing nearby, watched the scene with a face full of shock.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Zhang Yu had been communicating privately, so Ye Xingli had no idea what they had discussed.

As she watched the True Monarch carry Zhang Yu out, Ye Xingli blurted out in astonishment, "Master, there are people outside!"

With a wave of his sleeve, Magnetic Pole Monarch shielded Zhang Yu from view. "Don't worry," he said casually. "With my concealment, no one will notice."

Watching True Monarch Magnetic Pole carry Zhang Yu down the street, Ye Xingli followed behind, her heart churning like a stormy sea.

As she recalled past events, she realized something profound: this was the first time she had ever seen her Master — or rather, her Master's avatar — holding another person.

Has Master gone mad? she wondered. How could someone so composed, so aloof, so self-possessed, be carrying someone else's student back to their dormitory?

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu, cradled in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's arms, grew increasingly tense.

Despite knowing that the True Monarch's concealment should render him invisible to the bustling crowds, he still felt deeply awkward.

"True Monarch," Zhang Yu blurted out, "just tell me what you want!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole chuckled softly, gazing down at Zhang Yu. "Old Gao held you like this during the examination, didn't he? What do you think of him?"
