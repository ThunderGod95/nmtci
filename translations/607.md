# Chapter 607: The Soul Transformation Gamble

Latest Ad Bids:

1st Place: Dao Qiankun (Myriad Laws University) - 830 Spirit Coins/Session

2nd Place: Kuang Tianqing (Heavenly Demon University) - 750 Spirit Coins/Session

3rd Place: Yan Xiang (Netherworld University) - 630 Spirit Coins/Session

On the third day of the competition, True Monarch Tranquility, the school team instructor from Myriad Laws University, studied the latest advertising bid rankings and thought to himself, "The top three have all increased their bids. Kuang Tianqing, in particular, has been aggressively closing the gap with Dao Qiankun after two days of relentless performance."

True Monarch Tranquility scrolled down the list. "The top ten are generally trending upward. Bai Zhenzhen, who has been fighting alongside Dao Qiankun and seems to have made a breakthrough in her sword technique, has climbed from tenth to ninth place."

"However, from eleventh place onward, the prices are mostly declining."

"After all, as the competition progresses, viewership increasingly concentrates on the top contenders."

The students watched and analyzed the rankings. When True Monarch Tranquility's gaze swept across Zhang Yu's name, he noticed that the student had dropped from 38th to 45th place.

This didn't surprise True Monarch Tranquility.

"After all, apart from the first day's battle, Zhang Yu has been holed up at the construction site, showing no further remarkable performances. As a result, fewer and fewer people are paying attention to him."

"But this is precisely the right strategy."

"After all, Kuang Tianqing has already targeted him. His name is likely highlighted with vibrant colors and special effects within Kuang Tianqing's Bionic Eye."

"Venturing out would be far too dangerous. It's better to remain hidden in the stronghold."

"If he can stay hidden until the very end, until Kuang Tianqing has no opportunity to strike again, that would count as a kind of victory."

"However..."

As True Monarch Tranquility watched the live broadcast, he thought to himself, "Given how things are developing, I'm afraid he won't be able to hide for much longer."

Above the floating continent.

Inside the Spirit Realm conference hall.

The divine light representing the ten Soul Transformation Principals shimmered gently.

Throughout the competition, while the ten Soul Transformation Principals couldn't be physically present to watch every match, they maintained a constant presence through their Divine Sense, monitoring the Ten Greats League. They occasionally exchanged remarks and insights with other Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs in the conference hall.

Each time the Divine Monarchs conversed or exchanged ideas, each shift in their thoughts and intentions, and each new perspective on the unfolding events... like extensions of their minds, countless Soul Cultivators across the Spirit Realm would swarm to leave comments, post threads, and manipulate data, igniting waves of public opinion across the Spirit Realm.

Now, after two days of intense battles, the third day's battlefield had grown remarkably calm. It seemed the students from each school had retreated into hiding, refraining from initiating further combat.

However, under Dao Qiankun's leadership, the Four-School Alliance led by Myriad Laws had captured a total of twelve prisoners — four more than the Four-School Alliance led by Heavenly Demon.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution of Myriad Laws University couldn't help but remark, "So this is all the legacy transfer from eight Great Divine Monarchs amounts to."

Divine Monarch Unrestrained of Heavenly Demon University retorted coolly, "If that were truly the case, why did Dao Qiankun avoid battle?"

Divine Monarch Spirit Rhinoceros of Joyful Union University chuckled softly. "Celestial Evolution, I can't let that comment slide. Are you implying our Joyous Union's dual cultivation techniques are inferior?"

The Principal of Celestial Monsters University snorted. "Dao Qiankun and Kuang Tianqing are clearly both intentionally avoiding confrontation to preserve their strength and prevent others from reaping the benefits."

He sighed. "The Human Race still lacks the monsterfolk's courage to fight with their backs against the wall."

In an instant, the Soul Transformation Principals seemed to be triggered, each voicing their opinions from within the divine light.

Some praised the superiority of the monsterfolk, while others affirmed the advancements of the Human Race. Still others argued for the unity and equality of humans and monsters. However, the conversation quickly shifted back to the arena, with discussions about Dao Qiankun, praise for the Four Heavenly Demon Schools...

The Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs' discussion sent ripples through the Spirit Realm, sparking waves of public opinion.

Each Soul Transformation Divine Monarch tried to steer the narrative to their own advantage.

Regardless, Dao Qiankun and Kuang Tianqing, with their exceptional performances, popularity, wealth, and top-tier strength, had become the most popular competitors in the Ten Greats League, shining brighter than ever.

As the livestreamed arena showed Kuang Tianqing leading the Four Heavenly Demon Schools in gathering their forces and converging on the Four Myriad Laws Schools' stronghold, more and more people realized that a decisive battle was imminent.

The Ten Greats League's livestream viewership surged to unprecedented levels.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution said, "Old Unrestrained, how about we make a bet?"

Divine Monarch Unrestrained asked, "What do you want to bet on?"

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution replied, "Didn't Kuang Tianqing declare earlier that she would capture Zhang Yu within three days? I bet she can't do it."

Divine Monarch Unrestrained said coolly, "So you think Dao Qiankun's students can protect Zhang Yu?"

"Alright, I'll bet Kuang Tianqing can break through Dao Qiankun's group's protection and capture Zhang Yu alive."

"Let's open the betting on the Heavenly Ascent Road."

The Heavenly Ascent Road, one of the largest gambling platforms on the second layer of Kunxu, boasted the slogans "The Immortal Dao's Fastest Shortcut," "Wholesale Market for Fortuitous Encounters," and "Opportunity Manufacturing Machine." It claimed that every year, countless impoverished individuals who ascended the Heavenly Ascent Road became wealthy overnight and then surged forward on the path of the Immortal Dao.

In the next moment, the other Divine Monarchs joined in, each placing their bets on the Heavenly Ascent Road.

News of the Ten Greats Divine Monarchs' betting pool quickly spread throughout the Spirit Realm, even being disseminated through the official channels of various schools.

With the Ten Greats Divine Monarchs, the Ten Greats League, Kuang Tianqing, Dao Qiankun... each a current trending topic, the launch of this betting pool immediately ignited a frenzy, drawing countless participants.

Especially on the Heavenly Ascent Road, which the Divine Monarchs had promoted, besides the "Kuang Tianqing Captures Zhang Yu" wager, there were also betting options on school rankings, the number of captives taken by each school, individual capture counts, and more.

In addition to the betting on the Ten Greats League, the platform offered tens of thousands of other gambling options, ensuring that every client always had something to wager on.

With the Divine Monarchs promoting the Heavenly Ascent Road, it quickly attracted a massive influx of capital.

True Monarch Heavenly Star of Heavenly Sword University silently observed the scene, muttering to himself, "They're setting up the house again."

He understood that while Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution and Divine Monarch Unrestrained, as Principals of Myriad Laws University and Heavenly Demon University respectively, had significant conflicts of interest, this didn't prevent them from collaborating to set up the house and split the profits when the need arose.

True Monarch Heavenly Star sighed, "A bunch of lower-level cultivators, burdened by loans and drowning in debt, barely have the time or energy to follow the Ten Greats League properly, catching only occasional glimpses... yet they dream of participating in the Soul Transformation gambling pools?"

"For lower-level cultivators, gambling is absolutely forbidden."

"But for Soul Transformation cultivators, gambling is merely another form of investment."

As he spoke, his voice echoed from the divine light representing him.

"Count me in too."

Meanwhile, in the arena on the floating continent, with six hours remaining until the end of the first match, Zhang Yu was slowly regurgitating the digested materials from his prison cell underground. He had been continuously consuming, excreting, and processing materials for over fifty hours.

"We're leading in prisoner count, and the Four Heavenly Demon Schools haven't made a move yet. The battlefield appears calm, which seems like a good sign, but..."

Zhang Yu knew in his heart that Kuang Tianqing must be preparing something. Though their interactions had been brief, he could sense that she wasn't the type to give up easily.

Just then, Ye Xingli sent Zhang Yu a message: The Four Heavenly Demon Schools might launch a full-scale assault.

Ye Xingli: In the coming hours, remember to stay hidden and don't show yourself. Don't let Kuang Tianqing target you.

Startled by Ye Xingli's message, Zhang Yu immediately asked where she had obtained this information.

He learned that the front-line students from Myriad Laws, Vajra, Immortal Soldiers, and Heavenly Sword Universities had held a joint meeting. During the meeting, they shared the latest intelligence and concluded that Kuang Tianqing was gathering her forces for a final offensive.

Zhang Yu wasn't surprised he hadn't been invited to the meeting; after all, his presence within the alliance was still relatively low-profile.

However, Ye Xingli's warning confirmed his own suspicions.

"Kuang Tianqing is coming... I need to hurry and finish my preparations."

Three hours remained until the end of the first match.

North of the Four Myriad Laws Schools' stronghold, Kuang Tianqing stood on empty air, her figure concealed by a thick cloud of mist overhead.

Her gaze pierced through layers of barriers to fix on the towering fortress kilometers away, focusing on the figure of her greatest rival, Dao Qiankun.

Kuang Tianqing murmured softly, "Dao Qiankun, if you want a group battle, then let's have a group battle."

Behind her stood three figures: Yan Xiang, the top student from Netherworld University; Bai Gu, the first-ranked student from White Bone University; and He Huan, the leader from Joyous Union University.

Turning to Yan Xiang of Netherworld University, Kuang Tianqing instructed, "Begin."

"Send Dao Qiankun a greeting. Tell him... we've arrived."

As the ground trembled violently, countless Demon Beasts erupted from the earth.

The floating continent was not only seeded with various resources but also teeming with Demon Beasts, forming a vital link in the ecosystem.

Yet now, these Demon Beasts lay strewn about, their flesh torn asunder, bodies rigid, and reeking of death — not a trace of life remained in them.

They had all been transformed into Corpse Demons by Yan Xiang of Netherworld University: fearless, impervious to pain, devoid of sensation, retaining only rudimentary intelligence and combat instincts.

Clearly, Zhang Yu wasn't the only one exploiting the arena's resources to enhance his combat prowess over the past three days. Students from other universities were also leveraging the environment to temporarily amplify their battle strength.

A massive, dark wave of Corpse Demons erupted from the earth, surging toward the fortress like a raging flood.

Simultaneously, countless defensive structures surrounding the fortress activated, unleashing torrents of Thunderfire that erupted into the sky.

Students then began taking turns engaging the advancing Corpse Demons, suppressing their relentless assault.
