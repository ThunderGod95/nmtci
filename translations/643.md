# Chapter 643: Master, I've Realized It

Hearing Bai Zhenzhen's question, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions replied dismissively, "Zhang Yu might not even be able to defeat Tian Shengong, let alone Kuang Tianqing."

"Kuang Tianqing has secured the support of eight Soul Transformation elders from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools. When it comes to investment in this year's participating students, it's nearly impossible for other schools to surpass her."

"After all, it's highly unlikely we'll ever see eight Soul Transformation cultivators willing to back the same candidate and the same Immortal Sect Technique again."

"Moreover, for someone in the Foundation Establishment Realm to reach Kuang Tianqing's current level — even to catch up slightly — would require an astronomical amount of resources. Other students can't simply throw money at the problem and expect to close the gap."

"Besides, the three Soul Transformation cultivators from Myriad Laws University likely aren't even united. How could they possibly rally the Soul Transformation cultivators from other schools to support Zhang Yu?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions sighed, "So now, every Soul Transformation cultivator is thinking about what to do after Kuang Tianqing wins the championship. How can they use her as a pawn in their power struggles? By then, all sorts of coercion, bribery, threats, and manipulation will be unleashed... Who knows how many schemes will be deployed?"

Bai Zhenzhen nodded slightly, but couldn't help but ask, "But if I win first place, I'll have the chance to choose that Immortal Sect sword technique, which could compensate for the current shortcomings of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, right?"

Bai Zhenzhen still remembered what Divine Monarch Seven Emotions had once said about the founder of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, the Extreme Emotion Sword Immortal. This senior of the Heavenly Sword Sect had not only created the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao but also another cultivation art that could compensate for the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao's decline from Immortal Sect-level to military-grade.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions paused, surprised. "I didn't realize you were still thinking about this."

"I've said so much already."

"Even though the chances of defeating Kuang Tianqing are so slim."

"Even though the pressure you'd face after winning first place would be immense."

"You still want to fight her?"

Bai Zhenzhen nodded firmly. "Master, I've climbed the path of the Immortal Dao for so long, finally reaching this point. Now I have the chance to fight Kuang Tianqing at their peak level."

"How could I not try to defeat her?"

"I've finally found a chance to compensate for the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao's shortcomings. How could I not seize it?"

Bai Zhenzhen took a deep breath and said, "This might be the only chance in my life to obtain an Immortal Sect sword technique, right?"

After all, Bai Zhenzhen knew that the reward of freely selecting an Immortal Sect Technique from the Dao Repository Catalog was likely a one-time occurrence. Even if Kuang Tianqing were no longer a formidable opponent in the future, even if she secured first place, she wouldn't be able to choose her own Immortal Sect Technique.

As she finished speaking, Bai Zhenzhen smiled again. "And if I win the championship, Master, you'll definitely protect me, right?"

Though he doubted his disciple could defeat Kuang Tianqing, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions replied calmly, "If you truly secure first place and earn the chance to select an Immortal Sect Technique, I will naturally protect you with all my might."

"After all, my greatest wish in this life is to one day restore the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao to Immortal Sect-level."

At this point, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions paused slightly before continuing, "Since you wish to contend with Kuang Tianqing, the next seven days will be even more crucial."

"During these seven days, the possibility of significantly increasing your cultivation is slim, but it's not impossible to further enhance your combat prowess."

"Just as swordsmen of old would purify their minds and bodies through fasting, incense burning, and ritual bathing before battle, allowing them to unleash their full power with each strike."

"Over the next seven days, you too can accumulate your Sword Intent through a series of preparations, pushing the power of your next strike beyond its limits."

Bai Zhenzhen's eyes flickered. "Can I really do that?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions replied, "The Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, and indeed all techniques of the Extreme Emotion Sword Immortal lineage, operate on this principle: the state of one's spirit can influence the material world."

"Having cultivated the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao to your current level, you should understand... only those with deep emotions can wield the emotionless sword."

"Your attempt to stimulate your potential through memories and the Illusionary Realm isn't inherently wrong."

"But the reason you can achieve this lies in the emotional connection between you and Zhang Yu."

"You must draw strength from your emotions, from your feelings of being moved. Use emotion to drive emotionlessness."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded. "I understand, Master. You mean that eating shit stimulates the taste buds because we usually eat so much sugar. If we ate shit every day, it wouldn't have the same effect. So we need to eat more sugar to make the shit taste even stronger."

After a moment of silence, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said, "If that's how you choose to interpret it, I have nothing more to say."

Bai Zhenzhen had already begun to ponder. "Drawing strength from emotions, from being moved..."

She couldn't help but recall countless memories with Zhang Yu, every detail of their shared experiences from their first year of high school to the present.

For some reason, the scene that ultimately lingered in her mind was the day Zhang Yu first took her to the dark tutoring base.

Bai Zhenzhen still vividly remembered the joy of her first successful trial lesson and the high salary she earned. She remembered riding on Zhang Yu's back, discussing their housing rental woes together. She remembered facing the rising sun with Zhang Yu, filled with anticipation for the future.

Most vividly, she remembered the panic she felt when her Spiritual Root first entered Zhang Yu's body, and the confusion during their first exchange of Spiritual Roots...

Lost in thought, Bai Zhenzhen instinctively touched her abdomen, feeling the Feather Spirit Root pulsing rhythmically within her Dantian.

The Feather Spirit Root and the True Spirit Root were proof of her friendship with Zhang Yu.

"I gave Yu Zi my most precious possession, and Yu Zi gave me his most precious possession without reservation."

"If we could ever reveal this publicly, it would be earth-shattering news that would move all of Kunxu."

A hint of pride flickered across Bai Zhenzhen's face as she thought to herself, "Forget all of Kunxu — how many practitioners of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao throughout history have ever experienced such profound emotion? Such genuine affection?"

Sensing the shift in Bai Zhenzhen's mood, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions continued, "It seems you've found the right approach."

"But human emotions and mental states are constantly in flux."

"That's why our predecessors developed various methods to stabilize one's state of mind, allowing the body to retain these feelings and sensations for longer periods."

Bai Zhenzhen said, "I understand. The incense burning, bathing, and fasting you mentioned earlier are examples of such methods."

"Through a series of actions, one strengthens their spirit and harmonizes their physical and mental states."

"So, what method is best suited for me?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions sighed. "Long ago, making vows was more effective. But according to current research, the most suitable method for practitioners of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao now is to transfer Spirit Coins with a note stating 'voluntary gift.'"

Though a hint of distaste lingered in her voice, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions continued, "In this era, gifting Spirit Coins represents pure, selfless emotion. The larger the transfer, the deeper the emotional investment. This effectively solidifies emotions and harmonizes the practitioner's mind and body."

Bai Zhenzhen's eyes flickered. "That makes sense," she murmured. "The more Spirit Coins transferred, the greater the emotional impact, and the more deeply the emotion is etched into one's heart."

"Master... was limiting my daily transfer amount for this reason?"

"Then... can you lift my transfer restrictions now?"

Moments later, Bai Zhenzhen transferred the remaining 50-odd Spirit Coins in her account to Zhang Yu, adding the required note.

But after completing the transfer, Bai Zhenzhen shook her head. "To participate in the Ten Greats League, I upgraded to a military-grade Bionic and a military-grade flying sword, not to mention other miscellaneous expenses. I've already spent most of my money."

"Transferring just 50 Spirit Coins won't be enough to solidify my emotions."

"Compared to my account balance, most of my assets are on my person."

"But if I sell everything I have and transfer the Spirit Coins, I'll greatly weaken myself. How can I possibly fight Kuang Tianqing then?"

A sudden resolve flashed in Bai Zhenzhen's eyes as she summoned a document within her Bionic Eye — her will.

She murmured, "This battle against Kuang Tianqing... without risking my life and betting most of my assets... victory is impossible."

Bai Zhenzhen's mind flashed back to the first team battle, where Zhang Yu had risked his life in a fierce clash with Kuang Tianqing.

"If I die in this fight, I probably won't even have enough Spirit Coins to revive myself."

"So, my upper body, according to the investment shares, should be entrusted to you, Master."

"But my lower body... I want to leave it to Zhang Yu."

Watching this scene, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said, "Good disciple, I sense your all-or-nothing determination."

"Both your emotional state and your resolve for this battle have gradually improved to an optimal level."

"Now, your chances of victory against Kuang Tianqing are no longer zero."

Bai Zhenzhen laughed heartily. "What are my odds now?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions replied, "Ten percent."

---

Inside the Spirit Hall, Zhang Yu suddenly received a transfer notification from Bai Zhenzhen.

Staring at the transferred sum of over fifty Spirit Coins, Zhang Yu couldn't help but feel slightly puzzled. "What's wrong with A-Zhen?"

He sent a message asking her what was going on. She replied: The cultivation method for the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao...

After hearing Bai Zhenzhen's explanation, Zhang Yu had to admit that the transfer seemed justified.

Bai Zhenzhen then began to discuss the matter of her will.

Bai Zhenzhen: Yu Zi, this year's Ten Greats League is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Bai Zhenzhen: And Kuang Tianqing is the opponent I most want to defeat in my entire life.

Bai Zhenzhen: I'll pour every ounce of my strength into this upcoming battle.

Bai Zhenzhen: But if I'm killed in action and become a Soul Cultivator, the lower half of my body will be yours to handle. Remember to take possession of it immediately.
