# Chapter 779: Invitation to Join the Team

November.

Inside the office area of the Edict Pavilion on the Kunxu Eleventh Layer.

Zhang Yu sat in his office, starting his work as usual.

But as his gaze swept across the dimmed names on his contact list, he thought to himself, "I wonder how Senior Sister and the others did on their exams?"

Nearly a year had passed since Zhang Yu joined the sect.

Not long ago, Ye Xingli, Le Mulan, Wen Wuya, and Li Xuelian had all embarked on their journey back to the Lower Realm to take the Sect Examination.

Zhang Yu had already discussed the follow-up arrangements with them. If they failed the exam, they would return to continue their outsourcing work.

If they successfully entered the sect, they would bring other classmates up to do outsourcing.

"If all four of them pass, they can bring four more classmates up."

"Yu Xinghan and I can each bring one more person up for outsourcing, making a total of eight."

"That way, next year, another eight classmates will gain experience in the sect before returning to the Lower Realm for the exam."

"If they all pass too, then the next time... we can bring a total of sixteen more classmates up for outsourcing. Then sixteen becomes thirty-two, thirty-two becomes sixty-four..."

Just then, Lady Fortune, who was nearby, interrupted Zhang Yu's daydream. "Are you trying to move the entire Myriad Laws University up here? Next, you'll be bringing up the vocational college students from the Myriad Laws Affiliated College and promoting them to 'Sect Specialized Students'?"

Zhang Yu chuckled. "I wish I could, but... I'm not capable of that yet."

Of course, Zhang Yu knew that such exponential growth was an idealistic fantasy.

The reality was that he wasn't even sure how many of the four — Ye Xingli, Le Mulan, and the others — who had returned for the Sect Examination would ultimately succeed.

"Thanks to the unique conditions of the Sect Layer, their foundational stats are already close to or at the peak of the Golden Core Realm."

"They've used all the Immortal Coins they earned to buy exclusive products from the Sect Layer to strengthen themselves."

"Senior Sister's Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart has also been upgraded to the 3rd-tier with my help..."

By collaborating with Ye Xingli on the Golden Core Stage magical artifact design blueprints, Zhang Yu had successfully helped her Dao Seed evolve.

A 3rd-tier Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart allowed them to merge three design blueprints at once.

Meanwhile, Le Mulan, Yu Xinghan, and Bai Zhenzhen had all received Zhang Yu's Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art a year ago in the Lower Realm while absorbing the Sect Examination Memories.

"Over the past year, Le Mulan can now create eight clones, drastically increasing her learning and cultivation efficiency," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "And after several sessions of my assistance and guidance, she can use her Profound Cold Meridian to freeze her Sect Examination Clone, effectively gaining independent control over it."

"They... should be able to pass the examination, right?"

Due to the Myriad Laws Sect's recent push to develop dual cultivation techniques, every sect disciple had to meet certain dual cultivation data requirements. Failure to do so would attract the attention of the Dual Cultivation Support Department.

According to Zhang Yu's information, this mysterious and terrifying department was filled with countless experts who specialized in capturing individuals with zero dual cultivation sessions over a certain period.

"Once you're targeted by them... who knows what cruel tortures await!"

Thus, Zhang Yu periodically pulled Le Mulan aside to fake their dual cultivation data using Dharma-Warding Talismans, simultaneously aiding her cultivation.

He had originally intended to help Yu Xinghan in a similar manner, but at the time, Yu Xinghan had simply smiled faintly and said with fearless confidence:

"I've already consulted Teacher Starfire about the specifics of the Dual Cultivation Support Department."

"I have to admit," Yu Xinghan sighed, "that place... truly does target my weaknesses."

"But on the path of the Immortal Dao, one must advance or fall behind."

"Everyone fears being targeted by the Support Department. I, however, will do the opposite. I'll test the danger myself and see just how terrifying this 'Demon's Den' truly is, tempering my already forged dao heart."

Zhang Yu didn't know what Yu Xinghan experienced in the Support Department afterward, only that his spirit seemed to have grown even more resilient, the fighting spirit in his eyes burning brighter. He had even become a regular visitor to the department.

"Should I test myself too? Go through a trial in the Support Department?"

Just then, Immortal Slayer continued their conversation about Ye Xingli, Le Mulan, and the others returning for the Sect Examination.

"Zhang Yu, you should understand that not all our companions can follow us to our final destination."

"Along this journey, some will inevitably fall behind, some will be left behind, and some might even become your enemies in the future."

"Perhaps," Zhang Yu replied with a faint smile. "But at least for now, I still hope... to leave no one behind if I can help it."

Seven or eight years ago, back in high school or university, Lady Fortune would have probably already started arguing with Zhang Yu, urging him to abandon such outdated thinking.

But now, Lady Fortune realized her own perspective had subtly shifted without her noticing.

"I used to not understand Zhang Yu's insistence on bringing his 'hometown folks' along everywhere he went," she thought to herself.

"But looking at his achievements over the past few years, this approach isn't without its merits."

"Especially within the sect, bringing more of our own people up will be a great help later when establishing laws or supporting the Dao Lineage..."

Besides the changes in his companions, Zhang Yu himself had made significant progress since becoming the leader of Martial Dao Group One.

With more free time for cultivation each day, Zhang Yu relentlessly pushed his basic cultivation art, raising his Nascent Soul Sacred Body to level (27/25).

Previously, at level (16/16), the Nascent Soul Sacred Body provided a 60% boost. Now, that bonus had stacked up to a staggering 140%.

Currently, Zhang Yu only needed to circulate the basic cultivation art with his Monsterfolk Clones about a hundred times to push it to level 40.

This allowed Zhang Yu to cultivate his basic cultivation art faster and faster each day, spending less and less time on it.

As a result, in addition to his primary duties, he began taking on some part-time jobs.

Within the Myriad Laws Sect, Sect Staff were permitted to accept part-time tasks issued by other departments or Sect Enterprises, in addition to their main responsibilities.

These part-time jobs primarily offered Immortal Coins and were a crucial channel for countless cultivators to earn extra income.

Some high-quality tasks were even snatched up on the day they were posted, attracting a large number of competitors.

The tasks had various requirements for the applicant's Cultivation Realm, skills, and track record, meaning one couldn't simply take any job they wanted.

When Zhang Yu first joined the sect as a newcomer, the tasks he could accept often paid only a few dozen Immortal Coins.

He had to continuously complete tasks and earn positive reviews to qualify for higher-quality, better-paying jobs.

Now, with his status as Acting Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One and a substantial track record of achievements, Zhang Yu had a much wider range of tasks to choose from.

He could now take on jobs like designing cultivation art testing environments or providing guidance on cultivation art design, offering valuable advice on how to pass the review process.

The income from his part-time jobs, combined with his salary and the bonuses transferred from Martial Dao Group Three, caused Zhang Yu's earnings to soar. He had even upgraded to an Immortal Spiritual Root.

Back when he was choosing one, Zhang Yu had hesitated.

The Immortal Spiritual Roots available at the Sect Layer had undergone generations of development, enhanced by various Immortal Dao Technologies. The sheer variety was enough to leave him dazzled.

There were long, thick Immortal Spiritual Roots that came with eighteen Spirit Veins built-in.

There were others with astonishing storage capacity, capable of holding over a hundred thousand liters of matter.

There were even some that could be used for production, refining large quantities of Immortal Pills daily.

But the more heaven-defying the Immortal Spiritual Root's effects, the more expensive it was.

Some rare types even required reservations years in advance.

"Fortunately, my own Feather Spirit Root is already powerful enough. Buying an Immortal Spiritual Root is just for show anyway."

After some consideration, Zhang Yu bought the cheapest, most basic model of Immortal Spiritual Root.

This one had no special functions; its sole purpose was to refine spiritual energy and enhance Magic Power, though its efficiency was over a hundred times greater than that of a Heavenly Spiritual Root.

And so, by buying the cheapest Immortal Spiritual Root and being as frugal as possible with his daily cultivation and living expenses, Zhang Yu's savings finally broke through 25,000 Immortal Coins and 440 Dao Merit.

"I'll keep saving," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "Once I have over 100,000 Immortal Coins... I'll see if any Immortal Sect Techniques go on sale."

While he was quietly saving money, Zhang Yu suddenly noticed a sharp increase in the workload for his group.

It was as if a flood of martial dao techniques had been released all at once, sent directly to the Review Department for approval.

As he reviewed these techniques, Zhang Yu clearly saw that they seemed to be interconnected, layer by layer...

"It's like... they were all developed by the same project team."

Subsequent events proved Zhang Yu's suspicions correct.

"Immortal Sect Techniques?"

Zhang Yu looked at Qu Yizhi before him and asked curiously, "Where did you hear that?"

As the long-standing Group Leader of Martial Dao Group Three, Qu Yizhi clearly had his own information channels within the Edict Pavilion. He replied, "I heard it's already circulating among the higher-ups. It won't be long before we all know."

"After all, reviewing an Immortal Sect Technique is always led by the higher-ups. They'll establish a Special Task Force and then pull elites from the lower ranks to join it."

Seeing the lingering doubt in Zhang Yu's eyes, Qu Yizhi quickly added, "True Monarch Zhang, you've reviewed quite a few techniques recently, haven't you? Don't you think many of them share the same origin?"

"As they say, 'When a whale falls, ten thousand things are born.'"

"The creation of a new Immortal Sect Technique often leads to the development of numerous Immortal Dao Technologies, countless cultivation arts, and a wide range of products."

"The applicants usually submit all these things together to build a copyright moat, preventing others from taking advantage of their work."

"The techniques we've been reviewing lately are likely derivative arts from that Immortal Sect Technique."

Zhang Yu understood, nodding slightly before asking, "Do you know what technique it is?"

Qu Yizhi shook his head and sighed. "Not a clue."

He lamented, "Speaking of which, there are only a handful of top-tier laboratories within the sect capable of creating Immortal Sect Techniques. But this one didn't come from any of them. There wasn't a single whisper about it before it appeared."

"You know, developing any cultivation art requires massive, sustained investment."

"That's why various Immortal Sect Techniques are often heavily promoted even during development, to attract resource injections."

"If you're considering sales, you need even more widespread promotion, with advertisements plastered everywhere..."

Qu Yizhi's face was now filled with curiosity. "But this technique's origins are completely mysterious. We don't even know who funded it, and I haven't seen a single advertisement. It's as if it just popped out of a rock."

As Zhang Yu listened, an idea began to form in his mind. He wanted to participate in the review of this Immortal Sect Martial Dao.

"If I add the review of an Immortal Sect Technique to my resume, it would surely boost my future promotion prospects, wouldn't it?"

With this thought, Zhang Yu asked, "Group Leader Qu, do you know how one can join this Special Task Force and participate in the review of this Immortal Sect Technique?"

Hearing this, Qu Yizhi smiled faintly and sighed inwardly. "Who wouldn't want to join?"

He then said aloud, "An Immortal Sect-level technique would be reviewed under the leadership of at least a Vice Pavilion Master. The specific personnel would naturally be selected by them."

"Recommendations can be submitted directly to higher authorities without going through department leaders. Given your performance, True Monarch Zhang, I think you have a good chance of being selected."

Qu Yizhi left one thing unsaid: their immediate superior, Lu Hengzhang, the Deputy Minister of the Review Department in charge of Martial Dao... If he decided to block Zhang Yu, Zhang Yu's chances of joining the team would plummet.

Zhang Yu had also considered this. He decided to find Gu Qingya and ask for his help in getting recommended for the team.

A short while later, when Zhang Yu found Gu Qingya and stated his intention, the response he received was even more surprising.

"I can recommend you, but there's no guarantee you'll be chosen."

Gu Qingya continued, "The Pavilion Master has decided to personally oversee this Immortal Sect Martial Dao project. Elites will be selected from all departments to participate in the screening. In fact, experts will even be brought in from other Pavilions to join the project."

"The Pavilion Master is personally overseeing it?" Zhang Yu was stunned. As a Seventh Rank Cultivator, the Edict Pavilion Master was a Great Power at the Void Refinement realm or above. He hadn't been involved in the Edict Pavilion's daily affairs for many years.

Gu Qingya continued, "I originally thought this Immortal Sect Technique would, at most, be overseen by a Vice Pavilion Master. I never expected the Pavilion Master himself to be drawn into it."

"While the Pavilion Master will likely just lend his name and not get personally involved, it still shows how highly this Immortal Sect Technique is regarded."

"Not to mention bringing in experts from other Pavilions... The forces behind such a joint project are likely even more profound and unfathomable."

At this point, Gu Qingya looked at Zhang Yu and asked, "A project of this magnitude is a great opportunity, but it will inevitably carry risks. Are you sure you want to participate?"

Zhang Yu nodded firmly. The higher the stakes, the more he felt this was his chance.

He knew that to climb the sect's hierarchy, he had to seize every opportunity.

"Even if this mission doesn't help me get promoted, learning an Immortal Sect Technique would still be a huge gain."

Zhang Yu's main worry now was that Lu Hengzhang would interfere and prevent him from joining the Special Task Force.

After Zhang Yu voiced his concerns, Gu Qingya immediately reassured him, promising to keep an eye on Lu Hengzhang for him.

What Zhang Yu hadn't expected was that shortly after he left Gu Qingya's office, Lu Hengzhang contacted him directly through the Dharma Realm.

Lu Hengzhang's Dharma Realm Projection materialized before him. There was no feigned politeness, no hint of a smile. The Lu Hengzhang before him seemed to disdain any pretense in Zhang Yu's presence, or perhaps he felt pretense was no longer necessary. His gaze, filled with intense contempt, disgust, and hostility, locked onto Zhang Yu.

"Here."

With a flick of his finger, Lu Hengzhang sent a notification hovering in front of Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu's eyes narrowed. It was an invitation to the Special Task Force.

"An invitation to the Project Team? Gu Qingya couldn't have acted this quickly..."

As this thought crossed Zhang Yu's mind, he saw Lu Hengzhang's name in the recommender field.

"This... Lu Hengzhang did this? He recommended me?"

Zhang Yu looked at Lu Hengzhang warily and asked, "Vice Minister Lu, what is the meaning of this?"

Lu Hengzhang replied coolly, "What? You don't want to go?"

"Gu Qingya may be higher-ranked than me, but as the Minister of the Review Department, he can't participate in the Special Task Force's work."

"But as the Deputy Minister in Charge of Martial Dao, I will be leading a team to join the Special Task Force."

"The higher-ups asked me to recommend some people, so I decided to recommend you."

"If you don't want to go, just reject the Special Task Force's request..."

With that, Lu Hengzhang's Dharma Realm Projection flickered and vanished from Zhang Yu's sight.

Recalling Zhang Yu's grave expression, Lu Hengzhang sneered inwardly. "So what if you're wary and cautious? You Lower Beasts who crawled up from the Lower Realm are nothing but wild dogs that won't let go once you've sunk your teeth into meat."

"Faced with a chance to climb higher, even if it means risking your life... you won't give it up."

"That's your inherent flaw, your destiny to be forever controlled by us."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu had already crossed the Dharma Realm and finished communicating with Gu Qingya.

"If I reject the Expert Group's invitation this time... even if Gu Qingya helps me apply again, I probably won't get into the Special Task Force."

"This guy..." Zhang Yu stared at Lu Hengzhang's name on the invitation, thinking, "Is he deliberately trying to pull me into the group?"

Although he knew Lu Hengzhang had malicious intentions, Zhang Yu decided to join anyway.

He thought to himself, "As long as it's just reviewing cultivation arts, I have nothing to fear."

And so, under Lu Hengzhang's disdainful gaze, he received the notification that Zhang Yu had accepted the invitation.

Lu Hengzhang sent a message, reminding him: "You'll join the group in one week. Before then... remember to cultivate the Formless Martial Art to Martial Twelve. That's the minimum requirement for working in the Project Team."

Lu Hengzhang knew that a single Martial Eleven technique cost 100,000 Immortal Coins, and two would total 200,000. For a Sect Staff member who had worked for many years, this was a sum they could scrape together by gritting their teeth.

But for someone like Zhang Yu, who had been in the sect for less than a year, it was an astronomical amount.

"He'll probably have to borrow money from everyone he knows, won't he?"

To Lu Hengzhang, this was inevitable. He knew that cultivators like Zhang Yu, who had clawed their way up from below, would never give up a chance to climb higher, even if it meant shouldering massive debt or losing everything they owned.

Lu Hengzhang could already picture Zhang Yu desperately seeking loans everywhere.

The thought of Zhang Yu being burdened with a high-interest debt brought a faint smile to Lu Hengzhang's lips.

"A debt like this might still be within your means for now."

"But once you experience failure in the Special Task Force, this debt will gradually become the final straw that breaks you."

As for succeeding in the Special Task Force?

Lu Hengzhang, who already knew some of the inside story, understood...

"Impossible."

"This Immortal Sect Technique is already doomed to be abandoned."

"And some people in the Special Task Force are destined to become cannon fodder."
