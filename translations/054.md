# Chapter 54: Zhang Yu's Choice

6:00 AM.

The sky was still a dim gray when Zhao Tianxing arrived near the school.

This was far earlier than his usual commute, for the simple reason that the monthly exam scores were being released this morning.

Since last night, Zhao Tianxing had been unable to quiet his mind enough to study or cultivate. Today, he simply came to school early, wanting to see his score the moment it was posted.

"This Daoist arts exam was a little tough; I wonder if I'll even manage to score a 60."

"Ugh, that Dao heart exam was brutal, too. I had to use the Bliss Powder twenty-three times. I have no idea what my score will be..."

Unlike students such as Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, who were indifferent to their scores after a test, Zhao Tianxing was the type to go around comparing answers with everyone.

If someone else’s answer matched his, he would feel a secret thrill of satisfaction; if their answers differed, he would often ask a few more people.

And for an exam like the Dao heart test this time, he would ask others how many times they had pressed the button, how many times they had administered the Bliss Powder.

If he heard someone had pressed it more times than he had, he would offer a few words of comfort, but inwardly, he would be delighted.

If he heard they had pressed it fewer times, his face would remain a mask of indifference, but his heart would sink, and a pang of anguish would strike him.

At this moment, still over two hundred meters away, he could see a crowd of students already gathered at the school gate, all of them clearly just like him, having arrived early to wait for the results.

There were students who felt they had improved and were eager to see their new rankings.

There were students who felt their grades slipping and worried they would be moved to a different class.

And, of course, there were pure score junkies who just wanted to know exactly how they had performed this time.

Zhao Tianxing watched Qian Shen standing at the very front, waiting while practicing his cultivation, knowing that he was always the first to arrive whenever the monthly exam results were posted.

Glancing at the still-closed school gates, Zhao Tianxing found a corner to sit down in, flipped open a book, and began to review.

After a few minutes, with a soft creak, the gates of Songyang High School swung open.

The students waiting at the entrance immediately pressed forward, surging into the campus like a school of sardines caught in a net.

When Zhao Tianxing reached the classroom, he saw that Qian Shen was already standing at the door.

Qian Shen was currently staring at the results sheet posted on the door, and a wave of relief suddenly washed over him.

Although his total score had dropped significantly this time due to a lower combat exam score, at least…

_Phew... at least Zhang Yu's score matches his strength. The monthly exam evaluation system at Songyang High School is, for the moment, bug-free._

Meanwhile, Zhao Tianxing glanced at the students around him, thinking to himself, _Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen aren't here yet?_

_Well, it makes sense. With their level of strength, they already knew the outcome without looking._

A wave of envy washed over Zhao Tianxing at the thought. It would be nice to one day have that kind of confidence and composure, to not be in a rush to see his results.

Zhao Tianxing quickly moved closer and began scanning the list from top to bottom for his name.

First Place, Zhang Yu, 653 points.

Second Place, Bai Zhenzhen, 652 points.

Seeing their rankings, Zhao Tianxing sighed to himself, _Aside from Daoist arts, their scores in every other subject must have been near perfect._

Of course, Zhao Tianxing knew this didn’t mean they could relax. As time went on, the difficulty and standards of the monthly exams would only increase, requiring constant progress just to maintain their scores.

Many second and third-year students saw their grades decline precisely because their own progress couldn't keep pace with the rising standards of the assessment.

But Zhao Tianxing felt that with the talent Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen possessed, maintaining their scores shouldn't be much of a problem.

At this thought, envy stirred in his heart once more.

_If only I had their talent._

Continuing down the list, he finally found his own name, and his heart leaped with joy.

Eighth Place, Zhao Tianxing, 594 points.

A short while later, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen entered the classroom, one after the other.

Zhao Tianxing noticed they both gave the rankings a cursory glance, seemingly paying them no real mind.

Watching them, Zhao Tianxing thought that Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu looked incredibly cool in that moment.

In contrast, he had been consumed with anxiety since last night, only to rush here first thing in the morning to check the results.

_Ugh, I'm so pathetic._

But as the day went on, Zhao Tianxing noticed that Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen seemed troubled by something.

He couldn't imagine it; one was first in their year, the other second... what could they possibly have to worry about?

Just then, a dark figure flashed past the window.

A loud crash echoed from the first floor.

Another student had snapped.

...

After school that day.

When Zhang Yu went to the school's quiet room again, intending to use his weekly privilege for free use of a spiritual root.

He saw Wei Xin swipe his student card, then look up in confusion. 

"Huh? Why isn't it working? Student Zhang Yu, please wait a moment, I'll go and ask..."

Zhang Yu casually took his card back. "No need to ask. I probably just made a mistake."

Even without asking, Zhang Yu knew this was undoubtedly the student council's doing again.

Later, on his way home, Zhang Yu felt an almost comical anger as he read a message on his phone.

It was from Lei Jun, his martial arts teacher, the one who guided him in combat practice.

"Zhang Yu, the school feels your physical strength still needs tempering. The plan is to have you consolidate for a year and participate in the martial arts tournament next year."

Zhang Yu silently exhaled.

The mana competition, the athletics competition, the martial arts tournament... It was obvious the student council intended to strip him of every chance to compete, barring him from this path entirely.

Other benefits, like the free use of a spiritual root, would also be cut off one by one.

If this continued, it seemed Zhang Yu would be reduced to taking temp jobs after class again.

_I'm still too weak..._

While waiting for the bus, he seized the moment to practice the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art, but the more he practiced, the more discordant it felt.

He was acutely aware that he lacked the mentality of fighting against all obstacles, a mindset that was fundamentally at odds with the state of mind required by this heart art.

Zhang Yu felt a fire smoldering in his heart with nowhere to vent.

Walking through the alley that led to his apartment, Zhang Yu thought, _What if I go to Li Xuelian? If she sees my current level in the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art, would True Monarch Xinghuo consider taking me as a disciple?_

_Can I bring True Monarch Xinghuo into this and create more room to negotiate?_

But the thought that True Monarch Xinghuo was likely just another person who wanted him to sign an indenture agreement made Zhang Yu sigh again.

He looked up at the sky, feeling as though all of Songyang City was one giant dining table, and he and Bai Zhenzhen were two dishes served on that table, waiting to be chosen by wealthy patrons.

_Should I run?_

_Flee to another city? Work odd jobs while I cultivate and lie low for a decade or so before re-emerging?_

_But what about Zhen? Would she be willing to run away?_

_Ugh, and this stupid ritual is forcing me to get into a university. She probably wouldn't agree..._

Opening the door to his apartment, Zhang Yu was taken aback and froze on the spot.

A slender girl in a White Dragon High School uniform was sitting in his chair.

Her long hair was pulled back into a ponytail, and her fair hands gently caressed the scabbard of a longsword resting on her lap.

Zhang Yu spoke with some difficulty. "S-Sis?"

This student from White Dragon High School was none other than the original Zhang Yu's sister—Zhang Pianpian.

What he hadn't expected was that she was a student at White Dragon High School, a detail completely absent from his inherited memories.

The large number '1' embroidered on her chest was especially shocking; it meant that Zhang Pianpian was ranked first in her year at White Dragon High School.

_My sister managed to achieve that? How did she do it? Why did the original Zhang Yu know nothing about this?_

Zhang Pianpian regarded him coldly and said in a flat voice, "Go see Zhou Chechen and sign the contract."

Zhang Yu instinctively frowned. "You're here to get me to sign?"

"I'm doing this for your own good," Zhang Pianpian said coolly. "If you keep resisting, they'll crush you."

Thinking of the ritual afflicting him, Zhang Yu replied in an equally flat tone, "Making me sign is the same as killing me."

Their gazes clashed. Seeing Zhang Yu's unyielding stance, Zhang Pianpian seemed to sense a grim resolve in his eyes, an acceptance of death.

She nodded slightly. "I didn't expect you to become like this."

"I thought you were better suited for a quiet, ordinary life."

"Since you're unwilling to sign with Songyang High School, then come with me. I'll take you to White Dragon High School."

Zhang Yu was momentarily stunned. Though a thousand questions flooded his mind, he asked the one he felt was most crucial.

"Can I still take the exam for the Ten Greats?"

Zhang Pianpian smiled. "Of course."

"The you of today finally has some of the spirit needed to strive for the Immortal Dao. Since that's the case, I'm willing to give you a chance to test for the Ten Greats."

Though this was his first time meeting his body's original sister, the Zhang Pianpian before him felt like a complete stranger, worlds apart from the person in his memories.

_Is this really Zhang Yu's sister? Are they the same person?_

_Did money and scores change her so completely?_

But Zhang Yu knew this wasn't the time to dwell on that, so he asked what he considered the second most important question.

Zhang Yu said, "Can I bring someone else with me?"

Seeing Zhang Pianpian tilt her head and look at him with curiosity, Zhang Yu continued, "Can I bring Bai Zhenzhen to White Dragon High School?"

Zhang Pianpian looked bewildered. "Why?"

Zhang Yu replied, "She's my sworn brother. I want to help her."

He thought to himself, _If I leave Zhen to face the student council alone, those bastards will be even more ruthless._

Zhang Pianpian asked, completely lost, "Sworn brother? Is Bai Zhenzhen a relative of ours?"

At first, Zhang Yu thought she was mocking him, but seeing her genuinely serious expression, he tried to explain.

"I mean that we're exceptionally close. When I was at my poorest, during the darkest time of my life, she gave me 500 yuan and bought me a meal."

Still looking confused, Zhang Pianpian asked, "Can't you just transfer 500 back to her now?"

"No," Zhang Yu said.

"What about 5,000?"

"This isn't about the amount of money."

He felt even more unsettled. The Zhang Pianpian before him was so unlike the sister from his memories.

Seeing Zhang Yu's insistence, Zhang Pianpian mulled it over for a moment before saying, "White Dragon High School has a limited number of spots. I can bring one person at most."

Zhang Yu's heart sank.

But then Zhang Pianpian continued, "However, if you can pass an assessment."

"Both of you can be protected."

Zhang Yu asked at once, "What kind of assessment?"

"Divine Assistant, or divine ministry outsourcing, as it's also known," Zhang Pianpian said flatly. "As long as you hold a position within a divine ministry, then at least until I enter university, no one would dare to touch either of you, even if you stay at Songyang High School."

"I can be your sponsor for the assessment."

"But you must understand, if you come with me to White Dragon High School, you'll be protected until graduation."

"If you only rely on this Divine Assistant position, however, they won't be so constrained after I go to university."

"And there is only half a year left until I graduate and leave for university."

"Are you sure you want to take this risk?"
