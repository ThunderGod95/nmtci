# Chapter 554: Issuance of Military Artifact Refining Engineering Certificate (Class A)

Inside the experimental floor of the Artifact Refinement Department, where numerous students and rented laboratories were located, True Person Refining Fire hesitated as he arrived.

"With all these special effects, I wonder how many Bionic Eyes can handle the sudden surge of spiritual energy," he muttered. "It'll be all flashing and lag — how will anyone see anything?"

Having spent years working at the grassroots level and understanding the students' actual conditions, True Person Refining Fire shook his head repeatedly. "Those higher-ups... they're completely out of touch with reality. How can Foundation Establishment or Qi Refining cultivators withstand such intense Spirit Realm fluctuations?"

Yet he knew he couldn't alter the orders from his superiors.

But if widespread Bionic Eye malfunctions and flickering occurred, not only would the announcement of the Military Certificate fail to be accurately disseminated, but any resulting accidents or losses would likely be blamed on him.

"We can't cause any accidents."

"But we still need to make a high-profile announcement while accurately conveying the message."

"There's only one way to do this — the old way."

After a moment's thought, True Person Refining Fire had no choice but to contact someone he knew in the Talisman Department and ask for a Veil Talisman.

"Sigh, I wonder if this Veil Talisman will be reimbursable."

Shaking his head, True Person Refining Fire activated the talisman. Invisible divine power instantly radiated outward from the activation point, spreading through the Spirit Realm in all directions.

Then, with a downward press of his finger, he commanded:

"Brightness: reduced!"

"Resolution: reduced!"

"Ray tracing: disabled!"

"Visual detail: minimum!"

As the Veil Talisman activated abruptly, True Person Refining Fire observed the Bionic Eye's performance and finally nodded slightly. "Now we can issue the Military Certificates."

In the laboratory, Jin Jun and his assistants were working tirelessly to refine the Heavenly Sun Radiance God prototype machine. He had completely put the matter concerning Zhang Yu out of his mind.

At that moment, Jin Jun's entire focus was on the prototype machine before him. He had poured all his energy and mental strength into this project.

Suddenly, he noticed a line of text flashing across his Bionic Eye:

"Important announcement imminent! Please cease all work and await further instructions."

As Jin Jun pondered the nature of the announcement, the world within his Bionic Eye first dimmed, then the entire visual field began to fade at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Simultaneously, everything around them became blurred and simplified, as if the world had been rendered into a mosaic of pixelated squares.

In an instant, everyone felt as though they had been transported to another dark and hazy realm.

Seeing the panic rising among his colleagues, Jin Jun waved his hand and said, "Don't be alarmed. This is the school issuing an important announcement. To ease the strain on our Bionic Eyes, they've automatically adjusted our visual settings."

The next moment, dazzling bursts of light erupted before their eyes.

Immortal Light soared skyward, illuminating the darkness like stars and flooding everyone's vision with brilliance.

Immortal Light radiated in all directions, swirling with celestial mists, as if countless deities and Buddhas had descended to earth, showering the world with divine applause.

In the next instant, colossal characters, towering and earth-shattering, exploded into existence before the crowd, filling the heavens and the earth.

Each character pulsed with boundless mysteries, shimmering with countless special effects that caused some students' bionic eyes to flicker slightly.

"Congratulations to Myriad Laws University, Artifact Refinement Department, Zhang Yu! In the process of refining the Heavenly Sun Radiance God prototype machine, he not only demonstrated remarkable progress, completing Levels 1 through 15 within two months, but also achieved exceptional craftsmanship, surpassing inter-university standards in all performance metrics, and ingeniously minimized production costs..."

"We hereby award him the Military Artifact Refining Engineering Certificate (Class A). We hope Student Zhang Yu will continue to strive for excellence and make further breakthroughs in the art of artifact refinement."

Upon seeing this announcement, teachers in other laboratories immediately cursed inwardly: "Damn it... making such a grand spectacle for a mere Military Certificate? Anyone would think he'd won one of the Ten Greats championships!"

Jin Jun, however, stared wide-eyed at the words, his gaze filled with disbelief.

"It's true... Level 15? He actually reached Level 15?"

In that instant, Jin Jun, who had been completely focused on his work, felt as if all his strength had been drained away. He lost all interest in the task before him.

It wasn't just Jin Jun; most of the people in the laboratory were in a daze, as if they had never imagined that their Project Team had already been defeated without them even realizing it.

Su Yunni, though mentally prepared, wore a blank expression. Bitterly, she thought, "We poured so much time and effort into this, only to lose like this in the end?"

A moment later, Jin Jun stared at the grand announcement, as if struck by a sudden realization.

"With such a fanfare, everyone will know Zhang Yu obtained the Military Certificate."

"Before long, everyone will know I, Jin Jun, was defeated by him — defeated by that guy who transferred from the Civil Engineering Department less than a year ago..."

"Zhang Yu has become famous now, but he's standing on my head to do it."

At this thought, Jin Jun's Magic Power surged violently within him, his muscles twitched, and his vital energy pulsed intensely throughout his body.

He could already see his reputation in artifact refinement plummeting, future funding shrinking, loan limits decreasing, and even the number of investors dwindling.

In the other laboratory, Zhang Yu was swiping his fingers, sketching and writing within his Bionic Eye.

Having reported the prototype machine and participated in the evaluation, Zhang Yu was now highly confident in securing the Military Certificate. He hadn't been worried these past few days.

However, obtaining the military-grade Heavenly Sun Radiance God was merely the beginning for him.

"It's early February now, with roughly six and a half months until the Ten Greats League in September."

"To win the Ten Greats League championship, I need to master at least four military-grade powers."

"That means, aside from the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power and the soon-to-be-acquired Heavenly Sun Radiance God, I must obtain two more military-grade powers within the remaining half-year."

"But even with four military-grade powers, I'd only barely match Dao Qiankun, Nine Heavens Liu, and Yan Qianji's level from last year."

"To surpass them this year..."

Zhang Yu recorded in his Bionic Eye: "Ideally, I should master five military-grade powers."

"Three more in the remaining half-year... is that even possible?"

Zhang Yu didn't know. He could only try his best.

"Next, I'll focus on the Design Competition to secure a military-grade artifact refinement technique."

"By then, the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor should be nearly deciphered. I'll apply to Teacher for permission to refine it."

"I'll also see if I can glean any insights related to the Great Sage's Heir set."

"Next, I'll choose..."

Zhang Yu mentally listed the available military-grade techniques. "If I get three more, I'll probably spend over 500 Spirit Coins in the next six months."

"My finances are getting a bit tight..."

"Hmm, once I get the Military Certificate, I'll immediately refine the Heavenly Sun Radiance God to unlock its military-grade performance."

As for what he'd do with the Level 20 military-grade puppet once it was complete?

Zhang Yu naturally planned to use it to make money. Why would he take it to war?

He couldn't bear to risk a puppet that had cost him hundreds of Spirit Coins in materials and effort. He'd rather risk his own life.

Just as Zhang Yu was deep in thought, the world suddenly darkened.

The next moment, the sky and earth shifted, and the notification of his Military Certificate slowly materialized before his eyes.

Zhang Yu showed no surprise at this sight. After all, he had anticipated it. What he hadn't expected was that a mere Military Certificate notification would cause such a dramatic spectacle.

True Person Refining Fire's projection materialized before Zhang Yu, saying, "Student Zhang Yu, I never imagined you'd obtain the Military Certificate in less than a year after transferring departments."

"Truly worthy of being a disciple favored by True Monarch Magnetic Pole."

After exchanging pleasantries, Zhang Yu accepted the Military Certificate from True Person Refining Fire, causing his ranking to skyrocket instantly.

First, his class ranking surged to first place. Then, his department ranking climbed rapidly, reaching 13th place.

As if breaking free from a cocoon, the department ranking shattered under an invisible force, revealing a new category: "Overall University Ranking."

Myriad Laws University, Undergraduate Stage, Overall University Ranking: 44th!

Simultaneously, three options popped up in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye: one toggling between department and overall university rankings, and the other two displaying only the overall university ranking or only the department ranking.

Zhang Yu pondered for a moment. If he had achieved this ranking through the Security Department or Transportation Department, he might have chosen to display only the overall university ranking.

But he never forgot his roots. He immediately decided to display both the Artifact Refinement Department ranking and the overall university ranking.

Watching his ranking appear, True Person Refining Fire smiled and congratulated him again. "Congratulations, Student Zhang Yu! After obtaining your Military Certificate, you've broken into the top 50 in the entire school. From now on, your school ranking will be publicly displayed, setting you apart from ordinary students."

"Even the Patrol Team will need to notify the Department Head before they can detain you."

Looking at his school ranking overhead, Zhang Yu couldn't suppress his excitement.

At the same time, countless messages flooded his Bionic Eye.

First was a friend request from a student in the Finance Department.

Huai Zhixia: Student Zhang Yu, our company has noticed the change in your academic performance and decided to revise our policies. We now offer a special loan program...

Reading the message, Zhang Yu smiled wryly. "Typical Finance Department," he thought. "They sensed my sudden surge in earning potential and are already trying to lift the restrictions and profit off me?"

Artifact Refinement Department Teaching Secretary: Student Zhang Yu, the Artifact Refinement Department offers professional laboratory rentals and discounted materials to students who have mastered military-grade artifact refinement techniques...

Ye Xingli: Junior Brother, this is the Artifact Refinement Department's military-grade student group. I've added you. [Group Link]

Yan Qianji: [Group Link] Junior Brother, this is the group for the top 50 students in the school. Join us!
