# Chapter 590: Immortal Dao Potential Skyrockets

Jin Jun: Senior Brother, who won?

Bei Wufeng: I lost. [Covers face]

Jin Jun: You lost?

Jin Jun: You lost to Zhang Yu? How is that possible?

Bei Wufeng: There was no way around it. He offered too much.

Bei Wufeng: I was defeated by his Spirit Coins.

Jin Jun's heart jolted upon seeing Bei Wufeng's message, his face etched with disbelief.

Jin Jun knew something of Bei Wufeng's financial resources. How many Spirit Coins would it take to make him give up his spot on the school team for the Ten Greats League?

"300 Spirit Coins? 600 Spirit Coins? Or... 1000 Spirit Coins?"

The more Jin Jun pondered, the more alarmed he became. "Zhang Yu is actually this wealthy? He defeated Senior Brother Wufeng with money?"

If Zhang Yu had defeated Bei Wufeng in a Sword Duel, Jin Jun wouldn't have been nearly as shocked. The sheer financial power Zhang Yu had displayed — enough to buy a victory over Bei Wufeng — struck him as far more terrifying and unfathomable.

"Where did Zhang Yu get so much money? Did True Monarch Magnetic Pole give it to him? If my Master had such ambition, my achievements would be far greater than they are now."

After inwardly lamenting his own Master's inferiority, Jin Jun grew envious of his Senior Brother.

"A price that even Senior Brother would accept... If they offered me that, I'd definitely give up my spot on the school team too. There's no way I could win first place anyway, so earning more Spirit Coins would be much more practical."

Jin Jun then recalled his previous competition with Zhang Yu.

"If you're so rich, why didn't you say so earlier?"

Jin Jun fumed inwardly. "Give me the money! I could have lost too! I could have conceded!"

Realizing he had lost both the competition and the money, Jin Jun felt like he had suffered a double defeat.

Feng Tingting: Senior, what brings you here to check on me?

Bei Wufeng: Tingting, the Civil Engineering Department has a bright future ahead. You need to seize this opportunity.

Bei Wufeng: Looking back, the director's decision to transfer you to Civil Engineering was a far-sighted move.

Feng Tingting: Huh?

Bei Wufeng: With the deepening conflict between the Ten Greats and the escalating Vocational College War, aren't Civil Engineering projects becoming increasingly numerous?

Bei Wufeng: Why would the Finance Department support the introduction of resources from Celestial Monsters University? It's all about grabbing a share of the economic growth in the Civil Engineering Domain.

Bei Wufeng: Our Artifact Refinement Department is backing Civil Engineering's competitive efforts for the same reason — to snatch a larger market share.

Feng Tingting: Senior, you must be busy with the school team. I never imagined you'd have time to pay attention to such major events.

Bei Wufeng: I've already withdrawn from the school team.

Feng Tingting: Ah?!

Feng Tingting: You quit? Who took your place?

Bei Wufeng: Zhang Yu is representing us in the Ten Greats League now.

Feng Tingting: Zhang Yu?!

Bei Wufeng: What choice did I have? He's just too wealthy.

Feng Tingting: Senior, are you saying he bought his way onto the school team?

Bei Wufeng: Nonsense! That's not what I meant.

Bei Wufeng: Don't go spreading rumors like that.

Ye Xingli: Junior Brother, rumors are spreading everywhere that you bought your spot on Bei Wufeng's school team.

Ye Xingli: Is it true?

Zhang Yu: That's complete nonsense.

Zhang Yu: If something like that were true, I would have asked you first, Senior Sister.

Ye Xingli smiled and nodded. "Good to know," she replied.

Ye Xingli: As long as you're willing to pay, Senior Sister will take on any business.

After ending the call with Ye Xingli, Zhang Yu casually glanced through the university student groups. Sure enough, he found plenty of people spreading the rumor, with figures ranging from 500 Spirit Coins to 1,000, and even some wild claims of 2,000. The stories grew more absurd with each retelling.

Some students were even repeatedly tagging Zhang Yu, demanding confirmation.

But honestly... Zhang Yu found being praised for his wealth far more satisfying than being praised for winning the Sword Duel against Bei Wufeng. Even the number of people seeking his artifact refinement services had increased.

After all, if Zhang Yu was already so rich and still offered artifact refinement services, why would he bother trying to scam us out of a few coins? He's loaded! He must care about his reputation, so the quality must be guaranteed!

After forwarding all the orders to his assistants in the laboratory, Zhang Yu once again immersed himself in cultivating the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon.

Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon: Level 12 (3/120)

In the Civil Engineering Department's office, Director Gao was discussing the situation at the construction site with True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Director Gao: It seems that many of the monsterfolk sent by Celestial Monsters University are infected with the Dual Rest Virus.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Hmph, everyone assumed the Dual Rest Virus spread because of the last attack on University City, which left behind various demonic cultists.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: But it turns out the virus brought by these monsterfolk is far more widespread.

Director Gao: Now that the Finance Department is willing to let us inspect their monsterfolk, the situation should be easier to control.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Inspections should have been mandatory from the start.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Do they think they can get away with this without handing over a few heads? The blood they've shed so far isn't nearly enough.

After further discussion, Director Gao suddenly asked: Did you bribe Zhang Yu onto the school team?

Clearly, Director Gao had also heard the rumors about Zhang Yu buying his way onto the team.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: How could I possibly do something like that?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Did you give him money?

Director Gao: I didn't.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Then my understanding is correct — it's all fake news. Probably just Bei Wufeng dragging Zhang Yu into this to salvage his reputation in artifact refinement.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: I bet he got some benefits from this.

Director Gao: I still remember when Zhang Yu first enrolled. He was just a nobody from the First Layer.

Director Gao: Who could have imagined he'd reach this point in just four short years?

As True Monarch Magnetic Pole read Director Gao's words, she fell into deep thought.

She recalled how Zhang Yu had repeatedly defied everyone's expectations.

From winning first place in the Civil Engineering Competition to transferring to the Artifact Refinement Department, defeating Jin Jun, triumphing over Bei Wufeng, and joining the school team... Each step had overturned countless people's perceptions of him.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: I never thought he'd make the school team so early.

Director Gao: Now that our disciple has reached this stage, we masters can't just stand by and watch, can we?

Director Gao: Since he's already on the school team, why not give him another push and see how far he can go?

Logic told True Monarch Magnetic Pole that Zhang Yu's path ahead would only grow more challenging. Even with additional investment, the returns would likely diminish.

Yet, for some reason, images of Zhang Yu flashed through her mind, and she remembered the words he had once spoken to her.

"I have a dream: to one day join a sect."

"I want to participate in the Military Competition of the Ten Greats League! And win an Immortal Sect-level Technique!"

"If I can win an Immortal Sect-level Technique, my chances of joining a sect will surely increase, right?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole seemed to see that pair of incredibly determined eyes floating before her again.

She sighed inwardly. "Aiming for the highest standard yields only mediocrity; aiming for mediocrity results in inferiority. To set a sect as one's goal... this ambition and desire must be one of the reasons Zhang Yu has come so far today."

"Even if Zhang Yu never joins a sect in the end, his achievements will surpass those of most university students."

A moment later, True Monarch Magnetic Pole frowned slightly. "Why am I daydreaming again?"

"Lately, I keep thinking about things related to that guy while I'm working."

After glancing at Director Gao's reply, True Monarch Magnetic Pole considered it and replied: Then let's give him another push.

Director Gao: The Civil Engineering Department can arrange a 100 Spirit Coin loan for him.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: I'll secure another 200 Spirit Coin loan for him.

Soon after, True Monarch Tranquility added Zhang Yu to the Contest Group.

Zhang Yu glanced at the group and saw that it consisted of ten members: three from the Artifact Refinement Department, three from the Finance Department, three from the Dao Techniques Department, and one student from the Talisman Department.

True Monarch Tranquility then began communicating with Zhang Yu again.

True Monarch Tranquility: Based on your circumstances, the school is currently willing to offer you the following cultivation paths:

Zhang Yu's heart skipped a beat, and he immediately focused on the message.

He knew that the school's cultivation policy for school team members was tailored to their individual circumstances, guiding them toward different paths to wealth.

After all, wealth was the best indicator of Immortal Dao Potential. The more wealth one could accumulate, the more resources they could command, the more Immortal Dao resources they could acquire, and the further they could advance on the Immortal Dao path.

True Monarch Tranquility: First, the simplest and most flexible option: the school will provide you with a low-interest loan.

True Monarch Tranquility: Second, considering your talent in artifact refinement design, the school will arrange channels for you to take on design commissions and sell the copyrights to your blueprints.

True Monarch Tranquility: The third option, considering your skills in civil engineering, artifact refinement, and flying sword communication, I can arrange communication projects for you. You'll earn money while learning.

Looking at the options provided by True Monarch Tranquility, Zhang Yu hesitated for a moment before asking for more details.

After gathering more information, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Selling design copyrights would be the most profitable, but the process takes too long."

He remembered the design copyright he had sold to the Myriad Paths Group last time, and he still hadn't received any royalties.

"Civil engineering projects involving array formations and communication would require too much of my time and energy."

With only two months left until the Ten Greats League, Zhang Yu was focused on pushing himself to become stronger and felt he had no time for such distractions.

"After considering everything..."

Zhang Yu's gaze finally settled on the low-interest loan.

"As expected, the most suitable path to the Immortal Dao for young people in Kunxu... still requires borrowing money."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "The Ten Greats League is just around the corner. If I win this competition, I'll have everything!"

"Now that the final sprint is here, I need to double down."

Immortal Dao Potential! Show yourself!

Zhang Yu replied, "Teacher, I'd like a low-interest loan."

True Monarch Tranquility: "Granted."

Soon after, the school's 350 Spirit Coin low-interest loan arrived in his account. Combined with Zhang Yu's own savings and loans from True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Director Gao, his balance surged to over 700 Spirit Coins.

This was enough wealth to trigger Heaven-and-Earth Phenomena and the awe-inspiring immortal music and light upon display.

Having taken on a staggering debt of 650 Spirit Coins, Zhang Yu now faced monthly repayments of over ten Spirit Coins for the next five years.

With such vast resources at his disposal, Zhang Yu waved his hand and began acquiring massive quantities of Calamity Qi from all directions, instantly spending over 200 Spirit Coins.

In the following days, his cultivation progressed at an astonishing pace, rapidly advancing the level of his Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon.

By the end of July, the cultivation art had smoothly reached Level 20.

Just over a month remained until the Ten Greats League.
