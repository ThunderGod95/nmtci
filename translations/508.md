# Chapter 508: My Master Is Useless; I Can't Protect You

Every time True Monarch Magnetic Pole touched him, Zhang Yu's body would involuntarily tremble, as if he were a piece of meat on a cutting board, being scrutinized by the other party.

This feeling intensified after participating in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's experiments and repeatedly undergoing her tests.

However, upon hearing her question, he suppressed his emotions and replied, "I rejected the Finance Department's invitation."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "The Finance Department's offer was exceptional, arguably the best any department could provide."

"Rejecting it so decisively... won't you regret it later?"

Zhang Yu replied firmly, "I know the Finance Department isn't right for me. The path of artifact refinement is the true path I should follow."

Director Gao's gaze darkened upon hearing this, his expression complex.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole, however, smiled slightly, as if observing a superior material, an ideal experimental subject. Stroking Zhang Yu's arm, she said, "Whether you're suited for artifact crafting is debatable, but you're certainly well-suited as artifact crafting material."

"Aren't you afraid that after transferring to the Artifact Refinement Department, I might use you for artifact crafting in the future?"

"Whether it's harnessing the power of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to enhance the Earthly Fiend Gravity within magical artifacts using your body as material..."

"Or deciphering the mysteries of the Soul Transformation Bionic and using your body's components to forge Yang Artifacts..."

"Both seem like excellent options."

Zhang Yu's body trembled slightly as he gritted his teeth and said, "Teacher, as long as I can join the Artifact Refinement Department, I'm willing to take these risks."

Director Gao, standing nearby, watched this scene with a sudden glint in his eyes, his breathing growing noticeably heavier.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole chuckled, pinching Zhang Yu's small hand. "These hands have been manipulating the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, enduring the tempering of Earthly Fiend Gravity day and night. They're becoming increasingly suitable for modification."

"Speaking of which, why are you so eager to join the Artifact Refinement Department?"

Zhang Yu looked earnestly at True Monarch Magnetic Pole, his gaze unwavering, and said, each word deliberate, "Teacher, you know I have a dream: to one day join the Sect."

"As long as I can join the Sect, I'm willing to take any risk."

"And compared to the Finance Department, the Artifact Refinement Department is the path most suited for me."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "Zhang Yu, your chances of joining the Sect are extremely slim, practically nonexistent. Even so, are you willing to risk everything?"

Zhang Yu replied, "I am."

Director Gao, who was watching this exchange, felt a jolt. He murmured to himself, "Join the Sect? Zhang Yu actually has such ambitions? Why didn't he ever tell me...?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed. "If you aspire to join the Sect, the Civil Engineering Department certainly can't support your ambitions. But why didn't you join the Artifact Refinement Department directly?"

Zhang Yu explained helplessly, "Because I'm poor. If I had joined the Artifact Refinement Department directly, I wouldn't have been able to afford to complete all the artifact crafting courses and conduct the independent experiments."

"A teacher I met in high school advised me to first join the Civil Engineering Department, earn money, and then find a way to transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department later."

Director Gao's mouth hung open. He now had to admit that the Civil Engineering Department truly couldn't support Zhang Yu's ambitions.

If he had heard Zhang Yu's desire to join the Sect... what would he have said?

Apart from advising Zhang Yu to give up, there seemed to be no other possibility.

If there was even the slightest chance of possibility in the Artifact Refinement Department, then in the Civil Engineering Department, it was utterly, absolutely, and completely impossible.

Given Zhang Yu's poverty, joining the Artifact Refinement Department directly would be a death sentence.

The only path before him was to earn money and then transfer departments.

Even with that, the difficulty was extraordinary.

Recalling Zhang Yu's struggles over the past three years, Director Gao couldn't help but sigh softly.

At the same time, True Monarch Magnetic Pole continued, "What are your plans and thoughts about joining the Sect? And what do you intend to do after joining the Artifact Refinement Department?"

Zhang Yu replied, "I want to participate in the Military Competition of the Ten Great Leagues and win an Immortal Sect-level Technique. If I can win such a technique, wouldn't my chances of joining the Sect increase?"

Seeing Zhang Yu's unwavering determination, Director Gao sighed inwardly again.

Participating in the Ten Great Military Competitions, striving for overall first place, and obtaining an Immortal Sect Technique... This was something utterly impossible for the Civil Engineering Department to achieve, and something he, as Director, couldn't assist with in the slightest.

In fact, if Zhang Yu were to voice such ambitions within the Civil Engineering Department, he would only be dismissed as delusional.

Watching Zhang Yu progress step by step, Director Gao had to admit that the young man was utterly serious and focused on achieving his goal, even though it still seemed impossibly distant.

In terms of future prospects, the Civil Engineering Department offered no fertile ground for Zhang Yu's ambitions.

In terms of benefits, Zhang Yu would gain far more by joining the Artifact Refinement Department. According to their contract, this move would also bring greater profits to Director Gao in the future.

In terms of support, Director Gao could no longer help Zhang Yu advance; in fact, he might now be holding him back.

Seeing Zhang Yu's unwavering determination and ambition, Director Gao realized he had no reason to keep him. Letting go seemed the most rational and correct choice.

Meanwhile, messages flooded in from professors, experts, leaders, and teachers within the Civil Engineering Department.

Director Lin: Old Gao, the Finance Department has already made their move. Get Zhang Yu to apologize immediately, or this could escalate into a major crisis!

Old Director (Soul Cultivator): Old Gao, what's the situation? I heard the Finance Department has already taken action.

Director Gao couldn't resist replying: I'll call you "Old Director" out of respect. But if I didn't respect you, you'd be dead right now.

With that, he blocked the Old Director.

Yet even after venting his anger, Director Gao couldn't shake off the bitterness in his heart.

"In the end... it's all because I'm too incompetent."

"Voluntarily letting go is better than a direct confrontation with Zhang Yu."

"Magnetic Pole... you knew I'd do this, didn't you?"

Director Gao sighed inwardly at this realization.

Watching True Monarch Magnetic Pole manipulate Zhang Yu like an experimental subject, Director Gao couldn't resist sending a message: "Be gentle. You're nearing Soul Transformation, while Zhang Yu is only at Foundation Establishment."

Director Gao: "Zhang Yu's physical body is the result of years of meticulous cultivation — constant medication, carefully arranged training sessions, and gradual refinement. It's now at the golden standard for the Foundation Establishment Stage."

Director Gao: "You must help him forge it into a growth-type Bionic."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Don't worry, Old Gao. For your sake, I'll take good care of him."

Simultaneously, Director Gao clicked on Zhang Yu's profile and began drafting a message in his mind.

Glancing at Zhang Yu and True Monarch Magnetic Pole before him, he sent: "Zhang Yu, the Finance Department is making their move. Your Master is powerless to protect you."

Director Gao: "I've arranged for True Monarch Magnetic Pole to transfer you to the Artifact Refinement Department."

Director Gao: "Once you're there, study diligently and never forget your goals."

Standing before True Monarch Magnetic Pole, Zhang Yu's body suddenly stiffened. "True Monarch," he said, "did Teacher Gao ask me to transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed. "Old Gao is a magnanimous man. He's doing this for your future. Remember to repay him well someday."

Zhang Yu replied, "Teacher Gao's kindness to me is like a second birth. He'll always be my teacher. I'll definitely repay him handsomely in the future."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Spare me the platitudes. Just fulfill your contract properly, help Old Gao earn more money, and let him live a few more years. That's all that matters."

Watching this scene, Old Gao's figure flickered, and his Spirit Realm Projection silently dissipated.

When he awoke in his Civil Engineering Department office, he found a message from Tu Lishan:

Tu Lishan: "Director, some students mentioned Zhang Yu seems to have been getting close to True Monarch Magnetic Pole lately."

Tu Lishan: "Before the Civil Engineering Finals, I even heard Zhang Yu say he was transferring to the Artifact Refinement Department."

Tu Lishan: "Is there any truth to this?"

Director Gao: "I told Zhang Yu to say that to boost morale before the competition."

Director Gao: "This was an arrangement between True Monarch Magnetic Pole and me. We plan to have Zhang Yu study in the Artifact Refinement Department. Keep this to yourself."

---

After Director Gao left, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's eyes flashed as she toyed with Zhang Yu's hand. "You've already completed the first three years of the Artifact Refinement Department's curriculum and have made significant progress in the later courses as well."

"But if you want to win a place in the Ten Great Leagues, that's still far from enough."

Although Zhang Yu possessed remarkable talent and now benefited from the Soul Transformation Bionic, which greatly accelerated his cultivation speed, True Monarch Magnetic Pole still doubted his chances of joining a Sect.

Of course, she wouldn't discourage Zhang Yu's enthusiasm. Letting him strive toward this goal and push himself harder seemed harmless enough.

The same applied to the Ten Great Leagues.

"Securing access to an Immortal Sect-level Technique is something everyone has already agreed to block."

"But there's no need to tell Zhang Yu that yet."

"Let him burn with his current fighting spirit, using this as his motivation to push himself. Even if he hits a wall later, it won't matter."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled faintly, looking at Zhang Yu. "To participate in the Ten Great Leagues, relying solely on the military-grade cultivation technique you possess won't be enough."

Zhang Yu nodded. "Teacher, I understand. That's why my first goal after transferring to the Artifact Refinement Department is to acquire Military-Grade power."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded. "The Artifact Refinement Department's Military-Grade power includes the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation, Void Calamity Transformation Diagram, and Heavenly Sun Radiance God from the magical artifact lineage, as well as the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor you brought from the Civil Engineering Department, which can also be counted."

"In addition, there are the cultivation arts Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon and Grand Void Divine Artifact Strategy."

"Have you considered which of these you want to pursue?"

Zhang Yu felt a surge of excitement, wishing he could learn them all.

Hearing True Monarch Magnetic Pole's words, he shook his head repeatedly and asked, "Teacher, I don't know which of these would be most suitable for me. I'm also unclear about the process for obtaining Military-Grade power. Do I need to wait for the Military Certificate exam?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied calmly, "Rest assured, our Artifact Refinement Department isn't like the Civil Engineering Department, where you have to wait two years for a chance to take the Military Certificate exam. In the Artifact Refinement Department, if you meet the requirements, you can obtain the certificate without taking the exam."
