# Chapter 428: Who Can Defeat Me?

The moment Su Yanyang saw the Jade Liquid Divine Monarch's announcement, his heart pounded as if it would burst.

"The Jade Nectar Coin is about to surge!"

"It's going to skyrocket!"

He immediately logged into the platform, determined to buy as much as possible. But no matter how many times he raised his bids, he couldn't secure a single coin, forced to watch helplessly as the price soared.

By the time he finally managed to acquire a small amount, half of his Underground Tomb had already been breached by the Yellow Turban Warriors.

Panic-stricken, he hastily activated his Grand Formation and combined its power with the Minor Threefold Combination to desperately fend off the invaders.

"Damn it!"

Su Yanyang's heart ached as he thought of the profits he'd missed by selling his Jade Nectar Coins too early.

"Who's spreading these rumors?"

"And why during the Military Certificate Examination? Is this a targeted attack?"

---

Meanwhile, in another examination arena:

As the Jade Nectar Coin's price continued to surge, the Soul Cultivators under Ping Han's command cheered wildly, their magical artifacts unleashing even fiercer attacks.

Ping Han, however, appeared increasingly calm and enigmatic.

Focusing his Magic Power, he tapped into the Spirit Realm Network and instantly pledged another portion of his Jade Nectar Coins.

His magical artifact membership was upgraded again, his Soul Cultivators' Calculation Pool resources expanded further, and his Dharma Bionic rapidly downloaded multiple Level 20 Cultivation Arts from the Spirit Realm.

At that moment, as the value of the Jade Nectar Coin fluctuated, Ping Han harnessed the momentum of heaven and earth, his power surging once more!

Facing the relentless onslaught of Yellow Turban Warriors, he raised one palm to support the sky and pressed the other against the ground. With a thunderous roar, Magic Power erupted from his body like molten lava from the earth's core!

Two years, he roared inwardly. Who knows what I've endured these past two years?

In these two years, I've witnessed the ebb and flow of fortunes, navigated the turbulent seas of the coin market, and faced nine bankruptcies without faltering!

Finally, I've forged this indomitable Dao Heart, unshaken even if the heavens were to collapse. I've gained eyes that pierce through the grand currents of heaven and earth, and I now wield earth-shattering power.

Now, a single thought from a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch can shake the very foundations of heaven and earth!

But this tremor doesn't harm me; instead, I harness it to ascend to greater heights!

Today, in this Military Certificate Examination, who can defeat me? Who even deserves to?

With another thunderous roar, Ping Han shattered rows upon rows of Yellow Turban Warriors!

On the Flying Boat, the judges and guests watched in awe as the fabric of reality seemed to unravel. Countless Spirit Coins, imbued with the raw power of the Immortal Dao, cascaded from the heavens like a torrential tide. Guided by Ping Han's shifting palms and tearing Magic Power, they surged into his body, his will sweeping across the battlefield!

True Monarch Cloud Haven watched Ping Han's performance, his admiration growing stronger. "His combat prowess has broken through again!"

"This young man truly has the potential to become a top-tier cultivator. He might even take another step forward on the Immortal Dao!"

True Monarch Celestial Elephant beside him was also visibly moved. "He faced the shifting tides of battle head-on, refusing to be overwhelmed. Instead, he harnessed the momentum to unleash even greater power. Ping Han is truly a remarkable talent!"

Fifth-Rank Righteous God Gengchen Yi commented, "Absolute force overcomes all techniques. With Ping Han's current combat strength, he's already unmatched on this battlefield!"

On the other side, Director Gao watched the scene, a question rising in his mind.

"Did I misjudge Ping Han? After these two years of tempering, he's no longer impulsive. Has his Dao Heart remained untainted by the allure of worldly power?"

Meanwhile, the Yellow Turban Warriors' assault grew fiercer and more relentless, soon culminating in their most ferocious and overwhelming wave.

Giant Yellow Turban Warriors, resembling colossal deities, strode forward with earth-shaking steps.

Some stood ten meters tall, clad in full armor, like mobile mountains.

Others were slender, wreathed in raging winds, darting forward at several times the speed of sound.

Still others crawled on all fours like beasts, their bodies bristling with high-speed vibrating Primordial Magnetic Channels.

Some Yellow Turban Warriors were clad in Ironclad Divine Thunder, spewing forth fiery dragon tornadoes from their mouths. These powerful warriors, akin to Foundation Establishment cultivators, swarmed towards the formation core, subtly forming battle formations and exhibiting coordinated intelligence.

Watching this spectacle, the examinees began to realize that these Yellow Turban Warriors were no longer mere puppets, but a true army — a Yellow Turban Army!

Faced with this relentless assault, Su Yanyang, already severely weakened, was forced into a desperate retreat. The underground palace he had constructed crumbled piece by piece as spiritual energy pathways were severed and divine thunder bombarded the central formation.

Glancing at the final five minutes on the clock, Su Yanyang gritted his teeth. "I have to hold on! I can endure until the very end!"

Meanwhile, Xiao Yunji, confronting the most ferocious wave of attacks, finally unleashed her full power. Her three heads shifted, her six arms contracted, and her body elongated, vaguely resembling a dragon's form.

Was Xiao Yunji attempting to transform into a dragon using her Transformation Dharma Armor? Would she sweep away the Yellow Turban Warriors with the majesty, ferocity, and power of a dragon?

No. In Xiao Yunji's eyes, dragons were nothing more than food — mere livestock in a farming pen!

How could anything compare to the ferocious power of the ultra-high-speed trains developed through the advanced technology of the Immortal Dao, capable of traversing the Eight Desolations and navigating the Four Seas?

Xiao Yunji's body underwent a series of transformations, morphing into a train over ten meters long — a high-speed locomotive that surpassed even dragons in speed, power, momentum, and durability!

The train hovered above the Primordial Magnetic Channel, then accelerated explosively, hurtling along the channel and crushing Yellow Turban Warriors into speed bumps in its wake.

On the Flying Boat, the assembled guests showered Xiao Yunji's transformation with lavish praise.

"No wonder Xiao Yunji's Dharma Bionic synchronization rate has always been so low!"

"It's a completely non-humanoid Dharma Bionic, devoid of even a trace of animalistic traits!"

"Losing the sensory awareness of an animal body gradually erodes one's humanity. Forget synchronization rates — if one's spiritual cultivation isn't strong enough, even the Dao Heart could regress!"

True Monarch Cloud Haven remarked, "All those modifications and Dharma Bionic enhancements... they were all for this moment of soaring glory!"

True Monarch Celestial Elephant sighed, "Alas, human effort has its limits. Even abandoning human form and humanity itself cannot overcome the timing and circumstances. Nothing can stop Ping Han's current momentum!"

Meanwhile, Geng Chenyi, standing nearby, chuckled, "Look at that, you two! There's another unexpected development!"

---

Zhang Yu, his body swollen with power, devoured the shattered remains of Yellow Turban Warriors. After digesting them, he spat out refined construction materials.

Rolling Gang Qi transported these materials throughout the earth giant's body, where Formless Warriors gradually forged them into the giant's skeletal framework.

As the skeletal structure took shape within the earth giant, its durability increased, and the internal power flow began to resemble that of a human body.

Zhang Yu understood that the challenges in this Military Certificate Examination would escalate with each wave. He needed to accelerate his progress and rapidly develop his capabilities to survive.

He refined materials, built the framework, and the earth giant's form grew increasingly massive. Its movements slowed, but the power it contained became terrifying.

He even used the ashes of the Ying Family within the giant's body, employing blood sacrifice techniques to enhance its strength.

Zhang Yu was constructing this earth giant as a mobile fortress.

As Great-Grandfather Yingxin gazed upon the ashes of his family, a warm current surged through his heart.

"Father, we're fighting side-by-side once more."

"The ashes of family truly warm the heart!"

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu continuously enhanced the earth giant's strength, he was crafting something beyond its skeletal structure.

When the final, most devastating assault arrived, Zhang Yu seized the armor plates forged from the remains of Yellow Turban Warriors and directly equipped the earth giant with them.

In an instant, the thirty-meter-tall earth giant transformed into a divine general clad in iron armor.

Zhang Yu decided this creation could no longer be called an earth giant, nor was "Formless Power Earth" fitting. He resolved to name it the Formless Spirit General.

Boom!

An Ironclad Divine Thunder projectile, fired by a distant Yellow Turban Warrior, hurtled toward the Formless Spirit General's chest with terrifying penetrating force.

Had this been the earth giant Zhang Yu had casually created earlier using the Minor Threefold Combination, it would likely have shattered into pieces, obliterated by a single blast.

But now, with an earth-shattering roar, the armor on the Formless Spirit General's chest glowed with scorched marks, only slightly dented.

Fueled by Gang Qi coursing through its skeletal frame, the Formless Spirit General stood firm, rooted to the earth.

This astonishing defensive power meant Zhang Yu no longer needed to constantly draw mud and sand to repair the General's body.

It also meant he could fully dedicate his Minor Threefold Combination to driving the General's movements and maintaining its structural integrity.

This wasn't just an increase in raw power; it was a refinement of both control and structural precision.

The Formless Spirit General's form shuddered as the body beneath its armor grew increasingly refined.

Thanks to Zhang Yu's Martial Dao Micro-Control and the enhancement from his Martial Dao Holy Body, the originally coarse mud and sand now clung to the skeleton, transforming into lifelike flesh and muscle.

Combined with the surging Formless Cloud Gang, the General, under Zhang Yu's command, became a living entity — an infinitely magnified version of himself.

Boom.

Stride forward, shoulder lowered, elbow dropped, palm thrust out.

The mud-formed muscles twisted and vibrated violently like steel cables, unleashing a torrent of power.

With a palm strike infused with surging Gang Qi, the fifteen-meter-tall Yellow Turban Warrior before them shattered into dust.

In that instant, Zhang Yu channeled the Formless Spirit General to unleash a single strike of the Dragon-Elephant Mountain-Crushing Palm!

Roar!

The Formless Spirit General roared, condensing a violent surge of Gang Qi in its mouth.

Simultaneously, within the Formless Spirit General's dantian, multiple Wildfire Platforms ignited, unleashing Thunderfire to bombard Zhang Yu's Formless Cloud Gang!

Beyond the skeletal structure and armor, Zhang Yu had also constructed defensive fortifications within the Formless Spirit General's body.

Now, the Wildfire Platforms erupted with Thunderfire. Transferred through the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force, the Thunderfire surged from the Formless Spirit General's mouth, sweeping across the battlefield like a thick, blazing line toward the Yellow Turban Army a hundred meters away!

On the Flying Boat.

Director Gao watched the scene, a smile creeping onto his lips. As expected of the Civil Engineering Department's prodigy, he thought. He's pushed his construction skills to their absolute limit!

This wasn't just technical prowess; it was ingenious design. Zhang Yu had fused his powers into a unified force, achieving an effect far greater than the sum of its parts!

Nearby, True Monarch Cloud Haven mused inwardly, Civil Engineering techniques applied to the Martial Dao... but ultimately, it's the mindset of artifact crafting. This boy's very essence has indeed transformed into the shape of a Magnetic Pole!
