# Chapter 195: The Examination is Paused?

As the Magic Power Meridian Injection was pushed into his body, Zhang Yu could feel his magic power, which already circulated nonstop 24 hours a day, begin to operate even more fiercely.

Under the violent absorption of the Great Sun Qi Sea, the surrounding spiritual energy surged toward him like a hundred rivers flowing into the ocean, finally transforming into wisps of magic power within his dantian.

"A pity, what a pity I don't have a spiritual root; if I had a spiritual root, and was also situated in a spirit vein… I could probably push my magic power to the 100-unit limit of Qi Refinement today, right?"

At the same time, Zhang Yu could feel the meridians in his body begin to twitch slightly, and his heart began to accelerate, his breathing growing more rapid.

_Is this the side effect of the Magic Power Meridian Injection? It's different from the Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor; it seems to place a greater burden on the respiratory and circulatory systems._

_As expected, different types of alchemical enhancers place burdens on different parts of the body._

_So, if I want a higher score, if I want to cultivate more comprehensively during this buffet process, I should take more of the different types of enhancers to make full use of the endurance of different areas of my body..._

_Enhancers that act on the Dao heart, magic power, and physical strength, respectively, can all be taken to both distribute the side effects and comprehensively increase my power._

Although he felt another layer of burden on his body, Zhang Yu did not stop, instead continuing to twist his body to cultivate the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, constantly increasing his physical strength.

He was well aware that an opportunity for a free, buffet-style injection session like today was far too rare.

"The total buffet time is only one hour."

"I must seize every moment of this hour to cultivate and waste as little of the medicinal efficacy in my body as possible..."

Thus, under the effects of the Great Sun Qi Sea and Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, the efficacy of the Magic Power Meridian Injection and Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor was thoroughly utilized, continuously boosting Zhang Yu's cultivation efficiency and accelerating the growth of his magic power and physical strength.

Beside him, Ye Lingxiao watched Zhang Yu inject the Magic Power Meridian Injection and, not to be outdone, followed with an injection of his own.

Feeling the medicinal power enter his body, his blood, meridians, and magic power all felt as if they were about to boil over, and Ye Lingxiao knew that in a short period, his tolerance for the Magic Power Meridian Injection had reached its temporary limit.

He struggled to control the violent convulsions of his muscles, thinking to himself, _Next, if I'm to take another enhancer, I'll have to choose either the Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule or the Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor._

_Once I digest some of this medicinal power in my body..._

And so, for the next few minutes, Ye Lingxiao continued to circulate the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen to digest the medicinal power while contemplating which enhancer to take next.

But before he could make a final decision, he saw Zhang Yu on the other side, after a round of digestion, grab another Magic Power Meridian Injection and plunge it into his body.

Ye Lingxiao's eyelid twitched as he watched this scene. _This guy..._

Faced with Zhang Yu taking the lead once again, this prodigy from the Immortal Capital who had been number one in everything since childhood and had to dominate every exam, naturally could not admit defeat.

He took a deep breath, grabbed a nearby Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule, and swallowed it.

In that instant, he felt all the negative emotions in his heart being suppressed, and even the pain from the side effects within his body was immediately alleviated by more than half.

Sensing this, Ye Lingxiao was delighted. _Indeed, this Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule can effectively alleviate my nervousness and reduce the mental impact of the drug's side effects._

_Taking this enhancer first will allow me to perform better in the subsequent examination._

_But what is this drug's adverse reaction?_

_I don't feel anything? Could it be that this drug has no adverse reactions? But it's unlikely for a drug like this to have no adverse reactions..._

A few minutes later, as Zhang Yu injected himself with another Magic Power Meridian Injection and also took a Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor tablet, Ye Lingxiao promptly accompanied him with two more Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsules.

After more than half an hour of exam time, both of their scores had reached a staggering 9,000 points.

Zhang Yu's magic power and physical body had also improved during this process, reaching 97.6 magic power and a physical strength of level 9.90, respectively, bringing him one step closer to the limits of Qi Refinement.

Watching their high scores, the other examinees nearby, whether it was Yu Xinghan or Meng Tao, felt their hearts pound with alarm.

Although they weren't the ones consuming so many ferocious enhancers, just the thought of the terrifying medicinal power currently contained within Zhang Yu's and Ye Lingxiao's bodies sent a shock through them.

Meng Tao thought, _Only a little more than half the time has passed, and they've already had six rounds of divine medicine? Are these two guys' metabolic rates that much stronger than mine? If today's drug-taking competition were a shit-eating contest, seeing these two would be like a dung beetle seeing a septic tank; the difference is simply like that between the clouds and the mud..._

Yu Xinghan stared deeply at Zhang Yu. _This kid… he's actually keeping pace with a top-tier young master from the Immortal Capital? It seems he was also hiding his strength when he was selling seeds at the Red Pagoda. If this guy was selling his wares while taking enhancers, his output would definitely far surpass mine._

Just then, Zhang Yu grabbed a Dragon-Elephant Preparation and injected it into his body.

Ye Lingxiao's gaze sharpened at this sight, a glint seeming to flash within his eyes.

"Dragon-Elephant Preparation? Trying to surpass me temporarily with a Dragon-Elephant Preparation?"

Watching this scene, Ye Lingxiao felt as if he were at an auction, watching a rival with no funds left try to outbid him with a mere 100-coin raise.

"Has this guy reached his limit?"

"And even now, he hasn't taken a Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule. Is he afraid of its unknown side effects?"

"If that's the case, then this examination is mine for the taking!"

Ye Lingxiao picked up a Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule, a trace of determination flashing in his eyes.

Although he still didn't know what the adverse reaction of the Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule was, he could perceive that his body had not yet reached its limit.

"First place is always mine, and it can only be mine."

To stand at the pinnacle, to forever monopolize the top spot, to always seize first place—this was not just the principle Ye Lingxiao had been taught since childhood, but the ancestral creed passed down through generations of the Ye clan.

"In this Kunxu, if you are not number one, then whether you are a prestigious family or a genius, the day of elimination will eventually come."

Thinking of how the Ye clan had striven for generations, step by step approaching the goal of becoming the strongest powerhouse on the first layer of Kunxu, Ye Lingxiao felt a surge of emotion in his heart.

He especially thought of how, after this Foundation Establishment examination, the clan would use his post-Foundation Establishment self to promote the Perfect Bloodline, which would also lead to news of the high school Foundation Establishment examination becoming known to more and more people.

This was both an ambition and a display of confidence.

It was simply because the Ye clan, and the other major Immortal Capital families they had allied with, believed that the average wealth and power of the Immortal Capital's great families had now far surpassed the other local forces on Kunxu's first layer, and no other local force could threaten them.

The Foundation Establishment examination no longer needed to be concealed. On the contrary, the recipients of the Foundation Establishment qualification certificates each year could be used for publicity, to bolster the expansion of their corporate businesses, and to facilitate their infiltration into other cities.

Thinking of the Ye clan's plan to break out of the Immortal Capital and begin expanding across the entire first layer of Kunxu, Ye Lingxiao felt a soaring pride born from generations of struggle.

"As a prodigy of the Ye clan, how could I lose to an outsider here?"

Ye Lingxiao opened his mouth and swallowed another Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu had been observing Ye Lingxiao's reaction after taking the Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule.

The reason he hadn't taken this drug yet was precisely because of its still-unclear adverse reactions.

But Zhang Yu hadn't completely given up on taking it; instead, he wanted to observe Ye Lingxiao's reaction to the drug before deciding whether he should take it himself.

"With my High School Sacred Body, my ability to metabolize drugs will surely surpass Ye Lingxiao's."

"As long as Ye Lingxiao can handle it, I can definitely handle it too."

And under Zhang Yu's observation, Ye Lingxiao's muscles were currently bulging and engorged with blood, his face was purplish, and a small lump had even risen on the top of his head.

"Seems manageable. I should be able to withstand it too."

After waiting for a few minutes and seeing that Ye Lingxiao had no major issues apart from the lump on his head getting a bit more swollen, Zhang Yu decided to try the Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule himself.

As Ye Lingxiao watched Zhang Yu pick up a Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule, he let out a cold snort and said, "Still not giving up?"

He was heard muttering, "I'll catch up to you soon. Once I take this Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor, you won't be able to catch me."

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback; looking at the drug in the other's hand, he said, "Aren't you holding a Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule?"

Ye Lingxiao gave a slight smile, "Take another Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule? The side effects of this drug are indeed fierce; I can't possibly take another one. But the side effects of this drug are actually nothing. After I take this Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule, I will completely suppress you!"

Hearing Ye Lingxiao's words, Zhang Yu was instantly stunned. Was that even coherent? Was there a problem with his own understanding, or was there a problem with the other guy?

"Could this be the side effect of the Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule?"

"It couldn't be a drop in intelligence, could it?"

Beside them, Yu Xinghan, Meng Tao, and the others had all heard Ye Lingxiao's nonsensical speech and looked at him with similar surprise.

It was at this moment that Huang Zichou suddenly called a halt to the examination.

Huang Zichou announced, "Examinee Number 23 (Ye Lingxiao) is currently experiencing some physical issues. There will be a two-minute pause..."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _Are they going to treat Ye Lingxiao? These righteous gods still have some conscience, looking out for the health and safety of the examinees..._

Huang Zichou continued, "Next, all examinees will sign a contract with me to maintain confidentiality regarding Examinee Number 23's reaction after taking the Dao-Dissolving Sustained-Release Capsule. In the future, you are not to disclose any negative information about this product...."

_What the hell..._ Zhang Yu cursed internally. _The examination is being paused to maintain secrecy about the side effects of this company's drug?_
