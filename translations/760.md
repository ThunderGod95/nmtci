# Chapter 760: Arriving at the Sect

"After I leave, you must continue to pay the interest on the Yu Bonds. Absolutely do not delay payments or try to manipulate them for profit."

"The interest from every single Yu Bond has become a necessity for countless people to survive."

"I don't expect you to raise salaries after I'm gone, but do not lower them..."

Glancing at the final message he had sent to the company's management, Zhang Yu sighed softly. He had no idea what would become of the company after he entered the sect.

Especially without his direct control, yet still within the sphere of influence of sect disciples like Yun Zhiguang, the future felt even more unpredictable.

Aboard the Flying Boat, Zhang Yu looked up, his gaze fixed on the distant tower piercing through the clouds on the horizon. He knew that was the so-called Dharma Realm Transmission Point.

Currently, these transmission points were being constructed all over the various campuses of Myriad Laws University, preparing for the future construction of the Dharma Realm.

The Spatial Technology Zhang Yu had previously promoted had become a powerful pillar supporting the Dharma Realm's construction, significantly accelerating its progress.

It wasn't just Myriad Laws University. The other institutions — Netherworld University, Immortal Armaments University, Heavenly Demon University — were all launching post-University War reconstruction plans, undergoing transformations under the guidance of the sects.

Zhang Yu could almost see a more frenzied, more Kunxu-like, and ultimately more repulsive version of the Ten Universities slowly emerging.

But if he wanted to influence this future, Zhang Yu understood that his only option now was to endure. Endure, climb higher, become stronger, and accumulate more wealth...

"Yu Zi," Bai Zhenzhen walked over to Zhang Yu's side, her curiosity piqued. "What are you looking at?"

Zhang Yu shook his head. "Nothing."

He turned to Ning Xiaoyan beside him and handed her a Myriad Laws Sect Repository. "A-Zhen, I heard the weather at the Heavenly Sword Sect is quite cold. I made some extra socks for you to take with you."

"Cold? What cold? I'm at the Nascent Soul Realm. How could I possibly be afraid of the cold?"

Though she found Zhang Yu's words baffling, Bai Zhenzhen was still pleased with the gift.

She channeled her Magic Power into the Great Void Cloud Repository, and the contents stored within immediately appeared in her Bionic Eye.

Staring at the seven pairs of silk stocking magical artifacts, each a different color, Bai Zhenzhen exclaimed in surprise, "When did you make these?"

Zhang Yu replied, "A-Zhen, do you remember our first year of high school, when we first went to the Immortal Capital?"

Bai Zhenzhen's gaze shifted slightly, a hint of nostalgia in her voice. "I remember. I remember when we first arrived, we wandered around the station, unable to afford anything. We even saw a pair of silk stocking-shaped external Spiritual Roots worth fifty million..."

Zhang Yu's thoughts seemed to drift back to that day as well... They were eighteen then, standing in the Immortal Capital station like insignificant nobodies, staring at the fifty-million-credit stockings and thinking they'd probably never be able to afford something like that in their entire lives.

"Back then, I promised you that once I had money, I'd buy you seven pairs in different colors, one for each day of the week."

Zhang Yu looked at Bai Zhenzhen and said, "Now, those stockings are no longer worthy of you. So, I took some time recently to refine these seven pairs for you."

However, time was still tight for Zhang Yu, so these seven pairs of stockings were only at the Golden Core level. The main function he had designed for them was cleaning; their abilities to assist in cultivation and combat were very limited.

But Bai Zhenzhen didn't care about these limitations. For her, the fact that Zhang Yu had personally refined them was all that mattered. The sentiment behind the gift was what she truly valued.

As her Extreme Emotion Sword Qi surged within her, Bai Zhenzhen exclaimed with delight, "Yu Zi! This is the best Immortal Dao resource for me! From now on, whenever I hold your stockings and remember that my best friend gave them to me, my Sword Dao cultivation efficiency will definitely soar."

"Why don't you wear them again?" Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhang Yu and said, "Stockings personally refined and worn by you, that's what will give me the real kick! The effect on my Sword Dao cultivation will be even better!"

"What the hell..." Zhang Yu sighed inwardly. "What do you mean, my stockings? And how exactly are you planning to use them? You Kunxu people... I'll never understand you."

The next moment, the Flying Boat accelerated sharply, piercing through layer after layer of the firmament before the Heavenly Eye. Soon, they arrived at the 10th Layer of Kunxu.

Watching the Flying Boat continue to ascend, a flicker of nervousness suddenly appeared in Zhang Yu's heart. "Finally... we're heading to the sect."

Just then, Zhang Yu felt a gentle squeeze on his hand. Bai Zhenzhen, beside him, had taken his hand in hers.

Their eyes met, a flicker of determination passing between them. From high school and the Foundation Establishment Exam to university, the Ten Greats League, the University War, and now the sect — they would face it all together.

Besides Bai Zhenzhen, Yu Xinghan, Ye Xingli, Le Mulan, True Monarch Starfire, Li Xuelian, Wen Wuya, and Kuang Tianqing also stood nearby.

Wen Wuya had reverted to her standard young girl appearance.

Unlike Zhang Yu and the others, Kuang Tianqing had brought no one with him to the sect.

Meanwhile, Yu Xinghan, also looking a bit nervous, spoke up to ease the tension. "Next, we'll break through the barrier between the 10th and 11th Layers and enter the 11th Layer, right?"

True Monarch Starfire explained, "The structure between the 10th and 11th Layers isn't a barrier; it's a spatial teleportation array."

"If you think of the construction of Kunxu, the first ten layers were just barren lands forcibly stacked together, flattened into pancake-like layers. The 11th to 20th Layers, however, are composed of countless carefully selected Treasure Lands."

"To ensure that the environments of these Treasure Lands don't interfere with each other, each one has been sealed off using Spatial Technology, becoming a closed space that requires teleportation to enter."

Zhang Yu nodded in understanding, mentally rephrasing the explanation in his own terms. "So, if each of the first ten layers is like an open-world game where you can fly across the entire map, then the regions within each of the 11th to 20th Layers are like separate, smaller maps. Moving from one to another requires a loading screen, or in this case, teleportation."

"These Small Worlds are like meticulously carved cubes, pieced together to form the Sect Layers from the 11th to the 20th."

The "Sect Layers" was the common shorthand for Layers 11 through 20.

"And at the very center of each Sect Layer lies its largest and most expansive world, where most sect members spend the majority of their time."

"This place is called... Central Apex Heaven."

As light and shadow flickered before their eyes, a brand-new world abruptly materialized before them.

Kunxu, 11th Layer, Central Apex Heaven, Myriad Laws District.

Countless wooden pavilions intertwined and connected, rising like snow-capped divine peaks that stretched endlessly toward the sky.

A thousand meters? Ten thousand? A hundred thousand?

The true answer gradually formed in Zhang Yu's mind: "The central region of each Sect Layer is called Central Apex Heaven. From there, you can travel to all the other regions and Small Worlds on that layer."

"In fact, the Central Apex Heavens of the 11th to 20th Layers... are essentially interconnected."

"And from the Central Apex Heaven of the 11th Layer to that of the 20th Layer, the total height is 100,000 kilometers."

"In other words..."

Zhang Yu gazed at the pavilions that seemed to stretch endlessly. He realized that this cluster of seemingly wooden structures extended all the way from the 11th Layer to the 20th, spanning a staggering height of 100,000 kilometers.

But having thoroughly studied the sect's knowledge base, Zhang Yu also understood that each 10,000-kilometer interval marked the boundary of a new layer. Those without the proper authorization could not pass through.

Just like them now. Within this Central Apex Heaven, they could fly no higher than 10,000 kilometers. The 12th Layer above remained inaccessible.

Staring at the architectural marvel that spanned 100,000 kilometers in height, Zhang Yu couldn't help but sigh inwardly. "So this is why they're not recruiting Civil Engineering majors anymore. They've pretty much built everything that can be built, haven't they?"

At the same time, an image of Myriad Laws University's University City on the 2nd Layer surfaced in his mind. He thought, "The University City seems to have been modeled after this style of continuous upward construction."

Simultaneously, everyone who arrived on the 11th Layer of Kunxu felt a drastic change in the spiritual energy. The efficiency of their cultivation arts surged, and even their minds raced faster. Their comprehension of their own techniques and their insights into the Immortal Dao all improved significantly.

Zhang Yu understood that this wasn't just due to the explosive increase in spiritual energy concentration...

"From the 11th to the 20th Layer, not only does the spiritual energy grow increasingly dense, but a trace of immortal aura gradually permeates the very fabric of heaven and earth."

"The radiance of the sun and moon in the air contains wisps of Dao Wisdom, which can enlighten the mind and enhance comprehension."

"In other words, the higher you go, the faster your Magic Power, Dao heart, and physical body will cultivate. The efficiency of comprehending cultivation arts and studying or developing Immortal Dao Technology will also increase exponentially."

"Furthermore, the unique Immortal Dao elements found only on these upper layers are essential for advancing to future Cultivation Realms."

Meanwhile, Yu Xinghan exclaimed in awe, "The air in the sect is so invigorating! Do the people up here really cultivate in this environment all the time?"

He found it hard to imagine. If he had always trained in such conditions, his cultivation would have advanced by leaps and bounds.

Ye Xingli asked worriedly, "Why isn't there a fee notification?"

Le Mulan also frowned, voluntarily stopping her breathing and cultivation. "It's not going to be incredibly expensive, is it?" she asked.

Wen Wuya frantically searched her memories of the Sect Examination knowledge, but she couldn't recall anything about the cost of environmental spiritual energy.

Before heading to the sect, they had already learned that the most common currency on the sect layers was called Immortal Coins.

This currency was anchored to immortal aura and personally minted by Immortals. It could be used across the networked territories of various sects on the sect layers.

It was also a currency strictly forbidden from circulating in the Lower Realm.

The problem for Zhang Yu and the others now was... their combined total of Immortal Coins was zero.

Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, "Right now, with zero cash... we might be at our most vulnerable. A single minor accident could plunge us into debt."

Just as everyone was growing anxious, True Monarch Starfire sighed, "This is all free. Use it as you please, absorb as much as you want. It costs nothing."

Hearing this, everyone was stunned. They couldn't believe that such a superior cultivation environment could actually be free.

Yu Xinghan couldn't help but marvel inwardly, "So this is a sect? A free environment, yet it already surpasses the best cultivation chambers below."

While everyone was lost in thought, the Flying Boat suddenly accelerated and arrived before a floating island.

The Newcomer Training School on the island was their destination. All newly recruited Sect Staff of the Myriad Laws Sect and their outsourced personnel would undergo a two-week, closed-door training program here.

Zhang Yu, Yu Xinghan, and True Monarch Starfire led Ye Xingli, Le Mulan, and Li Xuelian off the Flying Boat.

Zhang Yu turned back to Bai Zhenzhen, who was still on the boat, and waved. "A-Zhen, be careful."

Bai Zhenzhen replied, "You too, Yu Zi."

On the other side, Kuang Tianqing and Wen Wuya exchanged a glance with Zhang Yu, nodding in mutual understanding.

As the Flying Boat departed for its next destination, Bai Zhenzhen and the others gradually faded from Zhang Yu's sight.

When Zhang Yu's group reached the entrance of the training school, they saw lines of text projected from within the school, hovering in the air.

"Work four hours a day."

"Reduce ineffective overtime, focus on innovative work!"

"Charge forward without fear, the sect has your back."

Staring at these lines of text, Yu Xinghan grew increasingly astonished. "Is this really the Myriad Laws Sect's training school? Not some Demonic Sect base?"

"This is too evil," Ye Xingli couldn't help but add. "Has the training school been attacked? Why would they display slogans like these?"

Beside them, True Monarch Starfire sighed again. "These... are the sect's slogans. They're just a bit old now. There probably aren't many places that still project these."

Hearing this, the group exchanged glances. Yu Xinghan thought to himself, "The sect members... in such a superior environment, do they live such leisurely, decadent lives?"

As they spoke, beams of light scanned over their bodies, verifying their identities.

Immediately after, a notice was projected into the air in front of each of them.

Connection failed... Connection failed...

After several consecutive failures, a humanoid projection descended directly from the Spirit Realm.

"Why can't you even connect to the Dharma Realm?"

The newcomer frowned as he looked at Zhang Yu's group of six. "From the lower layers? So you're the ones who passed the exams from down there? No wonder..."

"I am one of the teachers in charge of this training. First, connect to the Dharma Realm, then install the Myriad Laws Steward."

"Without these two things, you won't be able to participate in the training at all."

As the teacher finished speaking, a notification appeared before everyone: "Enable Dharma Realm Connection?"

Looking at the "Yes" and "No" options below the notification, Zhang Yu knew he had no choice.

Nearly all areas within the sect's layer belonging to the Myriad Laws Sect were now covered by the Dharma Realm. To work, study, or cultivate within the sect, connecting to the Dharma Realm was the only option.

Fortunately, Zhang Yu had already activated the Dharma-Warding Talisman, allowing him to exploit loopholes in the Dharma Realm to hide his own data.

With a light tap on the "Yes" option, a progress bar instantly appeared and rapidly filled from 1% to 100%.

In that instant, Zhang Yu felt the world before him suddenly burst into life. The previously empty space in front of the training school's entrance was now filled with a dazzling array of colorful displays.

"Myriad Laws Newcomer Loan," "Heavenly Court Reserve Cultivation," "Buying Second-hand Cultivation"... All sorts of advertisements flashed before him, some Zhang Yu understood, others he didn't.

At the same time, beside the training teacher's Spirit Realm Projection, an almost identical figure appeared. Zhang Yu knew this was the Dharma Realm Projection.

He was suddenly reminded of the first time he used his Bionic Eye to see the Second Layer Spirit Realm.

The way the originally bare and gray University City had instantly transformed into a dazzling spectacle was strikingly similar to the scene before him now.

Just then, the training teacher tapped a finger, and another notification appeared before Zhang Yu.

"Install Myriad Laws Steward?"

Zhang Yu again chose "Yes."

"Is the installation complete?" the teacher asked, looking at the group. "Once it's done, use the Myriad Laws Steward to run your first self-check, then send me the report."

As the installation progress bar filled, a series of options appeared before Zhang Yu.

"Meridian Access Request."

"The Myriad Laws Steward requires access to your body's meridians for functions such as body scans, identity verification, cultivation art downloads, and remote guidance."

Zhang Yu sighed and silently selected "Allow."

Next came requests for Vital Energy Access, Organ Access, Magic Power Circulation Access... one after another, the prompts appeared before him.

Having diligently studied for the Sect Examination, Zhang Yu understood that these were necessary steps after connecting to the Dharma Realm. Only by granting these permissions could he use the Dharma Realm's various services and functions and work smoothly within the Myriad Laws Sect.

Refusing would be like refusing to use the Bionic Eye and the Spirit Realm in the lower layers, it would make progress impossible.

With each "Allow" he granted, Zhang Yu felt as if he were surrendering parts of his body, piece by piece, gradually losing complete control over himself.
