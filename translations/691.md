# Chapter 691: Evil God Register

With the establishment of the Spatial Technology Research Association led by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, attention surged not only from the Ten Great Universities but also from within the Righteous Qi Alliance.

Streams of Evil God consciousness converged deep within the Dark Spirit Realm, exchanging views on the matter.

Joy God remarked, "The World-Piercing Cone has been repaired, and a new Spatial Magical Artifact has been created. Clearly, Magnetic Pole has made significant breakthroughs in Spatial Technology research recently."

"If we let this continue unchecked, it will inevitably delay our conquest of the second to fifth layers."

One Evil God suggested, "Intensify our attacks to put more pressure on them and slow down their research progress."

Another Evil God added, "And what about Myriad Laws University? Eliminating Magnetic Pole would be ideal."

"That's too difficult," another Evil God countered. "Magnetic Pole is already immensely powerful, meticulous, and cautious. We haven't even managed to steal her Yin Artifact yet. How could we possibly assassinate her?"

"Then we must infiltrate the Research Association," one Evil God proposed. "We need to monitor her research progress at all times. If we can steal or decipher their technology, the war will turn even more in our favor..."

As the Evil Gods discussed how to infiltrate the Research Association and deal with Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, the Auspicious God, whose body was composed of swirling, colorful light, held a different view.

"Why aren't we targeting Zhang Yu?" the Auspicious God said. "In just a few months, Magnetic Pole has made such remarkable progress in Spatial Technology. I suspect Zhang Yu has been secretly sharing knowledge from Kunlun in the Palm with her."

"I've said it countless times: Zhang Yu is the key. If you had listened to me and captured him earlier, we wouldn't be facing so many complications now."

"We should have moved decisively to capture Zhang Yu long ago."

"But each of you insisted I refrain from rash action..."

Hearing the Auspicious God's words, the Joy God's thousand eyes narrowed slightly, sensing the accusation was directed at him — a pointed reminder of his previous rejection of the Auspicious God's plan to target Zhang Yu.

The Joy God replied, "Perhaps Zhang Yu was crucial, and perhaps we could have acted differently then. But now it's clearly too late."

"If Zhang Yu truly leaked the knowledge from Kunlun in the Palm to Magnetic Pole, then even if we capture him now, we won't be able to stop her."

"In any case, Zhang Yu is no longer the key. We should focus our attention on Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole. She's the one leading the advancement of spatial technology across the Ten Universities."

Another Evil God chimed in, "Auspicious God, you already launched a capture operation before, didn't you? You should know that Zhang Yu is Magnetic Pole's disciple. He can summon her at any moment. Capturing him is practically the same as capturing Magnetic Pole herself — the risks far outweigh the potential benefits."

As his colleagues' gazes shifted back to Magnetic Pole, Auspicious God sighed, "A bunch of insects."

Just then, the Herald God, who was chairing the meeting, sent Auspicious God a message: "You can continue monitoring Zhang Yu's activities."

"Bringing him back to the Fifth Layer isn't our top priority right now, but it's Fu Xiantian's request, and something we'll have to do eventually."

Spatial Technology Research Association.

Yan Qianji's mind drifted back to his recent conversation with True Monarch String Tone.

Just moments ago, Yan Qianji had attended an interview for Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's experimental team.

However, the competition was fierce, with even Nascent Soul Realm experts and professors vying for the positions. Yan Qianji's rejection was inevitable.

Yet, after the failed interview, True Monarch String Tone approached him, claiming to have secured an opportunity for him.

Yan Qianji's heart surged with hope, only to quickly realize that the opportunity was for outsourced work.

"Outsourcing?" Yan Qianji thought bitterly. "If full-time employees are Yin Artifacts... what's the difference between outsourcing and lubricant? Just expendable materials to support the full-time staff."

Though initially resistant, Yan Qianji's thoughts turned to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's spatial technology and the future technological revolution. He resolved to join.

He repeatedly told himself he was here to learn. As long as he had the chance to study spatial technology, nothing else mattered.

That was until he was stopped at the research institute's gate. After contacting True Monarch String Tone, he was finally admitted as a visitor and directed to Zhang Yu's office.

True Monarch String Tone patted Yan Qianji's shoulder and said, "I've already spoken to the security downstairs. From now on, just sign in as a visitor and contact True Monarch Blazing Light directly."

As a contractor, Yan Qianji understood his lack of official status.

True Monarch String Tone continued, "Your work will be supervised by True Monarch Blazing Light. If you have any questions, just contact him. You two were classmates, right? You should be quite familiar with each other."

Yan Qianji fell silent before blurting out, "But... aren't I a contractor for Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole?"

True Monarch String Tone chuckled. "Little Yan, we need temporary help here. Work here for a few months, and once things calm down, I'll transfer you back."

Yan Qianji persisted, "I applied for a permanent position here before. Could I just switch to a full-time role now?"

True Monarch String Tone shook his head. "All the permanent positions are filled. How about this... work hard and show your worth. If you perform well, I'll find a way to get you a full-time position next year."

And so, after going full circle, Yan Qianji ended up working under Zhang Yu after all.

As Yan Qianji had predicted, his work in the laboratory had absolutely nothing to do with Spatial Technology.

Every day, Yan Qianji came to the laboratory to refine the Heavenly Sun Radiance God for Zhang Yu, working alongside Jin Jun to diligently upgrade this Level 20 magical artifact.

Meanwhile, Bei Wufeng was refining the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword for Zhang Yu.

Liu Xiangqiao, Zi Yunzhen, Su Yunni, and others who had recently entered the Golden Core Realm were also learning and refining simultaneously, contributing to upgrading Zhang Yu's magical artifacts.

As for Zhang Yu himself, Yan Qianji only heard that he was in secluded cultivation in the Meditation Chamber, focusing on enhancing his cultivation.

Days turned into weeks, and before long, half a month had passed.

During this time, Yan Qianji's resentment grew stronger each day.

"Zhang Yu's cultivation advances by leaps and bounds, while I'm stuck here refining magical artifacts for him... What's the difference between me and a common laboratory worker?"

Looking at Zi Yunzhen and Su Yunni working nearby, Yan Qianji's resentment deepened.

In the past, these students had only been assistants in his Project Team. Now, they were full-fledged employees, while he was merely an outsourced worker without even a proper title.

Every day, Yan Qianji had to register upon entering and leaving the building and undergo a body search. Within the building, vast areas visible to the eye were pixelated for outsourced employees, all to prevent information leaks.

His movement within the building was strictly restricted, with even minor missteps triggering a series of warnings.

To access the Spirit Realm within the building, he needed Zhang Yu's permission each time. Even taking a few extra breaths of spiritual energy as an outsourced employee required additional payment.

Of course, compared to the treatment he endured as an outsourced employee, the issue of spatial technology remained Yan Qianji's primary concern.

"Zhang Yu's research team has nothing to do with spatial technology. I and the others are essentially his personal servants, all working solely for his benefit..."

After half a month, Yan Qianji noticed that many of the gazes previously fixed on Zhang Yu were gradually withdrawing, and those who had frequently sought information from him had stopped contacting him.

"Because Zhang Yu is just here to secure funding and use it to advance his own cultivation."

"If I stay here, I'll only waste my time."

With this realization, Yan Qianji began considering a job change. "I've heard other universities are recruiting researchers for spatial technology. Perhaps..."

---

Netherworld University.

Upon learning of Zhang Yu's current focus, Wang Yin thought to himself, "He's prioritizing his cultivation now? Zhang Yu, you might regret missing such a crucial opportunity later."

"Once Spatial Technology is fully developed, what will your Mid-Stage Nascent Soul cultivation, or even Nascent Soul Peak, matter?"

"Technological advancements often progress far more rapidly than most anticipate. Even with his Immortal Sect Technique, Zhang Yu can't possibly compete with the collective efforts of the Ten Universities' elites, hundreds of Nascent Soul True Monarchs, and the wisdom of dozens of Soul Transformation cultivators."

In Wang Yin's view, the Spatial Technology within the As-You-Wish Size Ring would soon be deciphered by the universities, leading to an explosion of diverse technological advancements.

"By the time Zhang Yu masters his Immortal Sect Technique, the Ten Universities' Spatial Technology will have already advanced to unimaginable heights..."

This realization ignited Wang Yin's fighting spirit. He sensed another opportunity to overtake Zhang Yu through a strategic maneuver.

"So what if I've failed repeatedly? As long as I remain steadfast in my beliefs, choose the right path, and harness the momentum of the times, who says I can't still win?"

In the following days, Wang Yin drastically reduced his focus on gathering intelligence about Zhang Yu, instead immersing himself entirely in studying Spatial Technology.

---

While Yan Qianji, Bei Wufeng, Jin Jun, and others were diligently refining magical artifacts for Zhang Yu, and countless cultivators from the Ten Great Universities were fervently studying his design blueprints, Zhang Yu's cultivation progress had been advancing by leaps and bounds over the past half-month.

First, he had pushed his breathing technique, mental cultivation technique, and multiple Body Refinement Techniques to Level 40, reaching the peak of the Nascent Soul Realm.

Then, his dao heart had reached Level 34 (1.24%), his Magic Power had reached 32,874 units, and his physical strength had reached Level 33.82.

Though focused on cultivation, Zhang Yu also managed the laboratory through the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

This reminded him of his former Teacher Magnetic Pole, whose true form was rarely seen, with most encounters being with incarnations crafted from the Profound Yin Heavenly Pearl. The old principal, Divine Monarch Myriad Laws, who used various cultivators' corpses as incarnations, had also operated similarly.

"The higher one's cultivation, the more tasks arise, making it even more necessary to refine various incarnations as extensions of one's will."

"The Heavenly Sun Radiance God now serves as one of my incarnations, though its level is still too low. I'll urge Yan Qianji and Jin Jun again tomorrow."

Despite his cultivation advancing by leaps and bounds, Zhang Yu remained unsatisfied. He wasn't just frustrated by the slow progress in upgrading his magical artifacts; he had also encountered a significant obstacle that prevented him from mastering the Immortal Sect Daoist Art, the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier.

Logically, with the Feather Book's assistance, Zhang Yu should have been able to successfully cultivate this Daoist Art to Level 1 after just one complete cycle.

"Half a month has passed, yet I haven't even managed a single complete cycle."

Zhang Yu knew his failure wasn't due to any lack of talent or insufficient laboratory funding. The problem was a missing ingredient:

"Void Soil..."

Void Soil wasn't ordinary soil; it was a complex mixture of dozens of artificially created Immortal Dao elements.

Producing these elements required an intricate and massive industrial chain, involving countless upstream and downstream enterprises across more than ten sectors, including Spirit Veins, mining, and smelting. It was a crucial component of the Immortal Dao industrial system.

Void Soil was also a vital resource for cultivating the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier.

Furthermore, refining the As-You-Wish Size Ring required vast quantities of Void Soil as well.

Originally, after Zhang Yu released the design blueprint for the As-You-Wish Size Ring, he expected to only needed to wait for the Ten Great Universities to increase Void Soil production and drive down its price.

But now, Zhang Yu suddenly realized things weren't so simple.

"Although Void Soil has always been crucial, its usage has remained limited. Companies have no incentive to increase production and lower their profits."

"Especially since... the vast majority of the Second Layer's space is occupied by Medicine Gardens, the Void Soil industrial chain is primarily concentrated on the Third and Fourth Layers."

"To increase production capacity, new factories would need to be built, a process that can't be completed quickly."

"After all, the refining of Void Soil is intertwined with numerous industries, involving complex Immortal Dao industrial systems."

"Moreover, with the Ten Universities currently scrambling to purchase Void Soil for their Spatial Technology research, its price hasn't fallen; instead, it has skyrocketed, and it remains in constant shortage..."

As Zhang Yu reviewed the report displayed in his Bionic Eye, he thought to himself, "At least two to three months... By then, Void Soil production should finally catch up with the Ten Universities' demand, making it easier for me to cultivate."

Two to three months might seem short, and for cultivators, it might not be considered a long time at all. But for Zhang Yu, it felt like an eternity. In the current rapidly changing situation, even that felt too long.

"If I don't have time to produce it myself, the best option is to seize it," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "The Void Soil industry is concentrated on the third and fourth layers of the Spirit Realm. Moreover, the Righteous Qi Alliance's Soul Transformation Cultivators must use Void Soil to cultivate Immortal Sect Daoist Arts involving Spatial Technology. They've likely been ramping up Void Soil production for over a year now."

With this in mind, Zhang Yu turned to Lady Fortune and said, "Let's go to the Dark Spirit Realm and inquire about Void Soil locations within the Righteous Qi Alliance."

Lady Fortune looked puzzled. "Void Soil? What do you need that for?"

"I need it to cultivate a daoist art," Zhang Yu explained.

Though Lady Fortune didn't know Zhang Yu had obtained the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier technique, she didn't dwell on it. After all, she saw it as a good thing that Zhang Yu was willing to utilize the Dark Spirit Realm's resources and rely on her more.

Moments later, the pair had returned to the Dark Spirit Realm and began searching for information about Void Soil.

Lady Fortune and Zhang Yu quickly discovered that under the Righteous Qi Alliance's governance, Void Soil was a restricted commodity, its trade strictly controlled. It could only be purchased by those who physically joined the alliance.

Information about it was even scarcer in the Dark Spirit Realm. Even when they found what seemed like leads, Lady Fortune shook her head. "Forget it. These are likely bait, traps set specifically for members of the Ten Great Universities."

"If you go there... you'll probably fall right into the Righteous Qi Alliance's trap."

But the more the Righteous Qi Alliance acted this way, the more Zhang Yu sensed they must have stockpiled a significant amount of Void Soil.

"As expected, the Righteous Qi Alliance began utilizing Spatial Technology earlier than the Ten Great Universities, and their focus on Void Soil must have started even earlier."

"Perhaps... they were already hoarding Void Soil before the war even began."

With this thought, Zhang Yu asked, "Lady Fortune, could we use your Evil God status to pry information directly from other Evil Gods?"

Lady Fortune replied, "Using my status to directly extract information would be too easily detected."

"Moreover, in the Evil God world, intelligence is intelligence, and secrets are secrets. To obtain them, you must trade — they can't be casually acquired. Even if my seniority surpasses theirs, it makes no difference. The Evil God world has no concept of respecting elders or teachers."

The next moment, Lady Fortune summoned a hierarchical list and said, "If you want to obtain more intelligence, you'll likely need to find a way to increase your authority within the Righteous Qi Alliance."

Zhang Yu gazed at the list and slowly said, "You mean... if I attain a higher position within the Righteous Qi Alliance, I'll gain access to more intelligence?"

The Righteous Qi Alliance actively recruits cultivators, so naturally, it has its own system for internal advancement.

By continuously completing various Righteous Qi Alliance missions and accumulating merit, one can progress from apprentice to disciple, steward, branch leader, hall master, guardian, elder, and finally, alliance leader. Each promotion grants greater authority within the alliance and access to more core secrets.

Lady Fortune chuckled. "You've been in secluded cultivation, focusing entirely on enhancing your strength, so I didn't want to disturb you."

"But honestly, I've always thought that since you've already secured a respectable position among the Ten Great Universities, you could leverage that in the Dark Spirit Realm. Play both sides, reap the benefits from both, and climb the ranks even faster, don't you think?"

Just as Lady Fortune and Zhang Yu were exchanging words, a message arrived:

Herald God: Fortune God, do you have a moment?

Seeing the Herald God's name, the Fortune God's gaze narrowed slightly. "That's the Evil God you spoke with at Myriad Laws University last time."

Zhang Yu asked, puzzled, "How did he contact us? Lady Fortune, did your concealment fail?"

Lady Fortune replied, "I'm not sure... Just don't speak for now. This one's status is extremely high, far beyond the Auspicious God and Joy God."

Fortune God: How did you find me? Have we ever interacted?

Herald God: Relax. I know we Evil Gods value our privacy. I didn't find you through my own abilities.

Herald God: I'm simply contacting you through the Evil God Register.

Hearing the words "Evil God Register," Zhang Yu remained clueless, but he could sense Lady Fortune trembling slightly, radiating panic.

"The Evil God Register?!" Lady Fortune exclaimed. "How does he have that thing?"

Zhang Yu immediately asked, "What is the Evil God Register?"

Lady Fortune took a deep breath and said hoarsely, "The Evil God Register is a record of all Evil Gods' existence."

"That's not all. Besides recording every Evil God, it can directly contact them, summon them, mark them, display their locations, and even show the locations of all their believers. It's a complete identity database..."

"What the hell... a register?" Zhang Yu exclaimed inwardly, startled. "Has our cover been blown?"

After a moment of panic, the two gradually regained their composure and calmed down.

Zhang Yu said, "That's not right. If our identities had truly been exposed, the process wouldn't be like this."

Lady Fortune nodded. "The Evil God Register is something only an Evil God King possesses. While the Herald God's status is high, it's nowhere near the Evil God King level."

After a moment of contemplation, Lady Fortune replied, "Nonsense! How could you possibly have the Evil God Register?"

Herald God: Our actions have the support of the Evil God Kings.

Herald God: To complete this mission, we obtained the refining method for the Evil God Register.

Herald God: Therefore, I currently possess the means to contact all Evil Gods from the Second to Fifth Layers.

Herald God thought to himself: "It's a pity that this only works for connections within the Dark Spirit Realm for now. To further enhance the Evil God Register's capabilities, I still need to refine this divine artifact."

At the same time, he strained to sense Lady Fortune's presence, but all he could detect was a hazy, mist-like reaction. He couldn't pinpoint her exact location, let alone capture any information she might have left behind in the Dark Spirit Realm.

The Herald God thought to himself, "As the Auspicious God and Joy God said, this Fortune God is an old hand with deep roots in the Dark Spirit Realm. Capturing him here won't be easy."

"We'll likely need to wait until the Evil God Register's functions are further refined before we can truly control him."

Giving Lady Fortune no chance to reply, the Herald God continued, "Fortune God, from now on, all Evil Gods on Layers 2 through 5 must obey my commands and serve the Righteous Qi Alliance."

"As far as I know, you've contributed almost nothing since the war began over a year ago. Your work ethic is abysmal — you barely even check in to the Dark Spirit Realm, and you haven't participated in a single team activity."

"You probably don't even recognize most of your colleagues in the Righteous Qi Alliance anymore, do you?"

Lady Fortune seethed inwardly. "If Zhang Yu hadn't kept me locked up, would I be like this?"

The Herald God pressed on, "If we had annual evaluations this year, I'd declare you unqualified without hesitation."

"If your performance and attitude remain unchanged, when we reestablish contact with the Evil God Kings, I'll report your situation and recommend you return for retraining."

Lady Fortune grew increasingly furious. Zhang Yu couldn't help but ask, "You have evaluations?"

Lady Fortune said, "Only incompetent Evil Gods play these games. Capable ones focus on long-term investments."

Lady Fortune replied, "I work for free. I don't need performance reviews."

The other party seemed taken aback, pausing before continuing, "Working for free isn't an excuse to slack off. I have a mission for you."

Herald God: Heavenly Demon University recently launched a fixed-term life savings program with a 100% interest rate...

This "100% interest rate life savings program" involves freezing individuals for a year and then reviving them.

The claim is that after a year, no lifespan is consumed, effectively granting an extra year of life for every year frozen. Dubbed a "life savings program with a 100% lifespan interest rate," it has become a popular choice among junior college students.

Herald God: After all, many junior college students are struggling to survive during the war and hope to freeze themselves until it ends.

Herald God: But in reality, while frozen, the students' bodies are harvested for labor, forced to perform dirty and exhausting tasks. A year of freezing can cost them more than ten years of lifespan.

Herald God: Your mission is to join your colleagues in raiding Heavenly Demon University's cryogenic storage facility, rescuing over a million junior college students, and exposing the truth behind the program.
