# Chapter 552: Prototype Machine Report

In the laboratory, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's mind sparked with inspiration. As her dao heart subtly shifted, design blueprints rapidly materialized within her Bionic Eye, each drawing flowing seamlessly into the next with every movement she made.

Finally, as she reviewed the complete Yin Artifact design, her brow furrowed slightly at the strange patterns etched onto the Bionic's outer shell. Lately, I've been designing numerous experimental machines for the Soul Transformation Bionic project, she mused inwardly.

But why do I keep... drawing these peculiar paint schemes and bizarre patterns?

Shaking her head, Magnetic Pole strained to recall the source of these inspirations, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't trace their origin. This only deepened her sense of bewilderment.

---

Zhang Yu memorized the design for his stocking-shaped magical artifact, then extracted a portion of the inspiration and shared it with Ye Xingli.

After all, the requirement for replicating her Dao Seed was that they jointly complete the design for an artifact refinement product.

Zhang Yu reasoned that if he simply sent her the design blueprints, it would become purely his own creation, failing to meet the Dao Seed replication criteria.

Upon hearing Zhang Yu's inspiration, Ye Xingli nodded repeatedly, her eyes lighting up. "Your idea is good. Wait a moment while I write it down."

With a flicker of light and shadow in her Bionic Eye, Ye Xingli continued, "However, I don't have time to discuss your design right now. I need to finish the blueprints I'm working on first."

After this exchange, Zhang Yu realized he had completely misjudged Ye Xingli's intentions.

"So Senior Sister isn't designing magical artifacts and Bionics for herself... she's creating an artifact refinement product suitable for Junior College Students."

Zhang Yu knew that while Ye Xingli's fan base had exploded recently, her product sales remained sluggish.

The underlying reason was simple: Myriad Laws University and the products she sold were too high-end, while Ye Xingli's fans were too poor to afford them.

Ye Xingli sighed deeply. "Among my followers, 53% are Junior College students and 35% are Lower College students. Their incomes are very low, so they're reluctant to buy anything priced over one Spirit Coin."

"We could sell cheaper brands, but that lacks differentiation and core competitiveness. Plus, those companies don't offer us much in terms of discounts."

"So I was thinking... could I design a unique product under my own brand? Something specifically tailored for people with limited means?"

"But after days of brainstorming, something still felt off."

Turning to Zhang Yu with a gentle smile, she continued, "After our conversation just now, it suddenly clicked."

"What I was missing was communication — the exchange of relevant information."

"I know too little about the lives of Lower College and Junior College students. How can I design products they actually need?"

Zhang Yu's heart stirred. "I have connections in both the Vocational College and Lower College communities," he offered. "I can help you gather data and refine your design."

Ye Xingli: "Thank you, Zhang Yu."

After a moment's pause, she sent another message: [1 Spirit Coin]

Looking at the message, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "As expected, the senior sister who sends money feels more genuine."

For Zhang Yu, gathering information from the poor was remarkably simple, given his extensive network of acquaintances among them.

He posted a questionnaire directly in the Hometown Group chat, and daily responses began pouring in.

Some requested Bionic Eyes priced at 1 Spirit Coin, with performance rivaling the Heavenly Eye.

Others desired mouths that could suppress taste and rapidly digest excrement.

Still others wished for buttocks that eliminated the need for defecation and urination.

There were also requests for Bionics that could transform legs into wheels and hands into versatile tools.

And some hoped for skins derived from Monsterfolk or Beasts, capable of shielding the body from environmental harm.

As Zhang Yu casually reviewed the responses, he noticed a recurring theme: each request seemed to prioritize deviating from human form, as if seeking to gradually transform themselves from living beings into animals or tools.

However, Zhang Yu refrained from immediately activating the power of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology. After all, this endeavor risked undermining their dao heart.

Neither he nor Magnetic Pole possessed sufficient understanding of the social dynamics at the lowest strata of Myriad Laws University. Prematurely activating the Encyclopedia's power could prove to be a wasteful endeavor.

Zhang Yu resolved to gather more information before initiating the Encyclopedia's power to finalize the design blueprints. He then planned to discuss the designs with Ye Xingli.

Another week flew by.

It was now early February.

In Jin Jun's laboratory, bursts of radiant light shot skyward as golden flames erupted from the prototype machine, causing the entire structure to slowly levitate.

The laboratory erupted in cheers and applause.

Jin Jun watched the scene, nodding and smiling repeatedly.

"Finally, it's done."

Nearly two months had passed since Jin Jun last completed a Level 5 prototype machine.

During that time, he had endured immense pressure, fueled by relentless financial strain. As expenses spiraled out of control, he had finally succeeded in refining a Level 11 prototype machine today.

He knew that this achievement qualified him to apply for a Military Certificate.

"But it's not enough."

"The success rate for Level 11 is still too low. I need to aim higher."

With a hint of satisfaction, Jin Jun announced a half-day break to his assistants, allowing them to catch up on online courses, relax, and then return to the laboratory to resume work.

He knew several assistants were facing heavy academic pressure due to upcoming final exams, and letting them study online would help alleviate their stress.

However, just two hours later, Jin Jun's self-assured composure vanished as his nerves tightened.

"What did you say?" Jin Jun asked gravely, staring at the message from his friend. "Zhang Yu has already submitted his application for the Military Certificate review?"

His friend, Bei Wufeng, was the second-ranked academic overachiever in the Artifact Refinement Department and a Senior Brother who had consistently supported Jin Jun.

Upon receiving this news, Jin Jun's first reaction was disbelief.

He had poured money and manpower into his project, pushing speed, efficiency, and quality to their absolute limits. How could Zhang Yu possibly be ready for the review?

"Did Zhang Yu's prototype machine exceed Level 11? Level 12? Level 13? Or even higher?"

Jin Jun shook his head. "Impossible."

His instincts refused to accept this.

"Or is he trying to participate in the Military Certificate review with just a Level 11 machine?"

Jin Jun didn't think Zhang Yu was foolish enough to attempt that.

"The success rate would be far too low."

Torn between these possibilities, Jin Jun hesitated about his next move.

"Should I even participate in the review?"

After careful consideration, he decided to gather intelligence first, to investigate Zhang Yu's situation.

He skillfully summoned Su Yunni and explained the situation to her.

Su Yunni was slightly startled by the news. She immediately sent a message to Zi Yunzhen for clarification, but received no reply.

Jin Jun urged, "Where is she? Go find her directly."

"If she's willing to reveal the specifics of Zhang Yu's project, money is not an issue. I'll pay her."

At a construction site in University City, workers were excavating and renovating the Primordial Magnetic Channel.

Similar projects had been underway throughout University City for months, and Zi Yunzhen had grown accustomed to them.

Yet as she gazed at the construction site before her, a look of helplessness crossed her face, and Zhang Yu's instructions echoed in her mind.

Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "Xiao Zi, the laboratory work is finished. For the rest of the month, you'll be working at the construction site."

"Huh?" Zi Yunzhen protested, her face filled with resistance. "The construction site? Boss, I... how can I go to a place like that?"

"What's wrong with the construction site?" Zhang Yu retorted. "I'm your boss. If I need you to help out there, you'll help out."

"I've secured several artifact refinement projects at the site. By working there, you'll be assisting the Artifact Refinement Department anyway."

"What? Don't you want your name on the prototype machine project anymore?"

Remembering the Heavenly Sun Radiance God project Zhang Yu held — and the prototype machine that stood a high chance of passing review — Zi Yunzhen ultimately relented and came to the construction site.

Ying Xin led her around, explaining the surroundings and today's tasks.

Just then, Fu Xinyao, who was standing nearby, spotted Zi Yunzhen. Her eyes lit up with excitement. "A student from the Artifact Refinement Department? Finally, I've been waiting for you!"

As a mole from Joyful Union University planted at Myriad Laws University, Fu Xinyao had been quietly gathering information from all sides.

However, the complex access controls across University City, coupled with the devastation of the economic crisis, had forced Fu Xinyao to suspend her operations for an extended period.

After finally reconnecting with Civil Engineering, Fu Xinyao tracked down Su Yanyang, a Civil Engineering student rumored to be close to Zhang Yu.

However, after a series of in-depth conversations, Fu Xinyao was horrified to realize she was becoming increasingly lazy, almost tempted to join the Dual Rest Cult.

Fortunately, her extraordinary willpower helped her overcome this urge, and she threw herself back into her work.

Now, as Fu Xinyao observed Zi Yunzhen, she thought to herself that her instincts had been right all along. With the resurgence of Civil Engineering and the launch of numerous construction projects, students from the Artifact Refinement Department were gradually being drawn into the fray.

Meanwhile, Zi Yunzhen had barely started working when Su Yunni suddenly appeared on the construction site.

"Su Yunni?" Zi Yunzhen asked curiously. "What brings you here?"

Su Yunni glanced at Zi Yunzhen's gaunt figure and the numerous scratches on her Bionic exoskeleton. "You've been working a lot of overtime lately, haven't you?"

Zi Yunzhen smiled faintly. "Well, since Zhang Yu is gone, I'm the only one left in the project team. There's more work than I can handle. But the extra practice has been invaluable for my progress."

A fleeting look of envy flashed through Su Yunni's eyes. In Jin Jun's project team, opportunities were scarce; with so many skilled members, you had to fight tooth and nail for every task.

"Isn't the laboratory busy today?" Su Yunni asked. "What made you decide to come to the construction site?"
