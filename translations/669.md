# Chapter 669: Sacred Body Completion, Saturation-Style Upgrade

Sensing the somber atmosphere, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole rallied the group: "These rebellious rogue cultivators on the Second Layer are nothing more than a minor nuisance. None of you are young anymore; just look back at history and you'll see that these disorganized, undisciplined bandits who only know how to kill and plunder have long been swept away by the tides of time."

"Their current resurgence is merely a temporary revival fueled by bewitchment. We simply need to suppress them once more."

Hearing Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's words, True Monarch String Tone of the Artifact Refinement Department immediately agreed: "The Divine Monarch speaks truly. This bandit-style cultivation and development model has long been obsolete and poses no real threat."

Regardless of their private thoughts, all the Nascent Souls present voiced their agreement.

True Monarch String Tone continued: "With resources dwindling, supply lines severed, and banditry rampant across the land, University City is consuming vast quantities of supplies every minute. The university's finances are strained. We must act swiftly to prevent chaos from engulfing the campus."

"While eliminating these rogue cultivators on the Second Layer isn't difficult, it will be tedious and time-consuming. After her breakthrough, the Divine Monarch must immediately enter secluded cultivation. The detailed execution of this task will fall to the rest of us."

The Nascent Soul cultivators nodded in agreement. "As it should be."

They understood that clearing out the bandits on the Second Layer was merely an appetizer. The true crisis lay in the upcoming Final Battle against the Fifth Layer's overwhelming forces.

As the highest combat power, the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs' most critical task after their breakthroughs was to consolidate their cultivation and maximize their combat prowess.

If the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs neglected their cultivation to chase trivial matters and put out fires everywhere, any early advantages they had accumulated would be meaningless. If they ultimately lost the decisive battle against the enemy Soul Transformation cultivators, all their efforts would be for naught.

Moreover, dispatching Nascent Soul True Monarchs to purge rogue cultivators offered significant benefits to those present.

With chaos rampant and rogue cultivators emerging everywhere, this was the perfect opportunity for Nascent Soul True Monarchs to seize opportunities and reap rewards.

Especially now that the Righteous Gods' oversight was absent, this situation presented them with more advantages than disadvantages.

"Misfortune may be the harbinger of fortune, and fortune may conceal the seeds of disaster," True Monarch String Tone mused inwardly. "I fear corruption will become rampant on the Second Layer, with every Nascent Soul cultivator sent out to purge rogue cultivators seeking to line their pockets."

At that moment, a holographic map projected into the air before them.

Director Gao pointed to various regions on the map. "Outside University City, many external campuses have lost contact. Wild cultivators are rampant, and we need to reclaim and purge them one by one."

Everyone present knew these campuses were part of Myriad Laws University's external holdings, including factories, warehouses, laboratories, logistics hubs, and affiliated schools. In the past, they had functioned like vital organs, constantly supplying Myriad Laws University with resources.

Suddenly, a figure stepped forward.

True Monarch String Tone narrowed his eyes, recognizing him. "True Monarch Azure Void of the Dao Techniques Department," he thought.

He knew True Monarch Azure Void was the director of the Dao Techniques Department. If anyone deserved a Soul Transformation Certificate besides Magnetic Pole, it would be this True Monarch, ranked among the top Nascent Soul cultivators in the entire University Realm.

However, due to his close ties with Dao Qiankun, True Monarch Azure Void had been implicated in the recent scandal. Neither the Heavenly Court nor Magnetic Pole had awarded him the Soul Transformation Certificate.

Now, True Monarch Azure Void spoke with unwavering resolve: "Principal, I am willing to lead the Dao Techniques Department students to clear the twelve southeastern campuses. I guarantee logistics will be restored within two months."

With that, he pointed his finger and swiped across the map, highlighting a region.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's gaze flickered as she murmured a faint "Good."

Director Gao, standing nearby, glanced at True Monarch Azure Void and thought to himself, "Is he trying to impress and secure the final Soul Transformation Certificate?"

The Heavenly Court had granted Myriad Laws University five Soul Transformation Certificates. Four had already been used, leaving the last one as a coveted prize among the Nascent Soul True Monarchs.

As True Monarch Azure Void finished speaking, True Monarch String Tone immediately stepped forward and also marked a region on the map.

"Principal, with just 500 Spirit Coins for funding, I guarantee to reclaim the nine southwestern campuses within a month and transport all supplies back."

A faint smile appeared on Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's previously indifferent face as she nodded approvingly at True Monarch String Tone. "Excellent."

True Monarch Grand Harmony of the Investment Management Office gritted his teeth and declared, "I'm willing to lead the entire Investment Management Office to sweep the Northwest bandits and maintain logistics, without requiring any funding."

Hearing this, the assembled Nascent Soul cultivators exchanged shocked glances at True Monarch Grand Harmony.

True Monarch Thunder Pole, Junior Brother of Magnetic Pole, clapped his hands and said, "True Monarch Grand Harmony is willing to work for the university without compensation, sharing the principal's burdens during this critical time. I believe he already possesses the potential for Soul Transformation..."

As one Nascent Soul True Monarch after another eagerly stepped forward, the regions on the map were quickly assigned.

But at the last moment, True Monarch Azure Void called out sharply, "When I lead my disciples into battle this time, I won't require any funding from the university. In fact, I'm willing to personally finance the restoration of lost territories and rebuild the logistics network."

In an instant, the murderous gazes of the assembled Nascent Souls locked onto True Monarch Azure Void.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, however, spoke with genuine emotion, "Excellent! Heroes emerge in times of crisis, and you are all heroes. Just moments ago, we were discussing so many difficulties and troubles, and now they've all been resolved?"

"Especially True Monarch Azure Void. If everyone at Myriad Laws University showed the same sense of responsibility as he does, why would we fear losing territory? Why would the Fifth Layer remain unbroken?"

With the bandit suppression missions assigned, the group moved on to the next pressing issue.

One Nascent Soul True Monarch spoke up, "That Blood Moon in the sky continues to spawn Demonic Sect members and Evil God believers, causing a massive increase in governance costs and logistics expenses..."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole declared firmly, "The Blood Moon is currently garrisoned by an enemy Soul Transformation cultivator. We must wait until I have fully stabilized my own Soul Transformation cultivation before taking action."

True Monarch Thunder Pole added, "To confront the Fifth Layer's massive army, we must first break through their spatial blockade. I propose immediately promoting Zhang Yu to Graduate Student, assigning him a laboratory, and supporting his efforts to derive breakthroughs from the Immortal Sect Techniques as soon as possible."

"While this process deviates from standard procedures, these are extraordinary times that require extraordinary measures."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded in agreement.

The other True Monarchs present were divided, some supporting the proposal while others remained skeptical.

True Monarch Azure Void thought to himself, "We have barely two or three years left. Even with additional investment, what breakthroughs could a newly advanced Golden Core cultivator like Zhang Yu possibly achieve in such a short time?"

However, glancing at Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole above, he ultimately remained silent.

In True Monarch Azure Void's view, this was merely Magnetic Pole seeking favors for her disciple. He would be a fool to object and risk incurring the wrath of the new principal.

Thus, when he saw Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole further request funding for Zhang Yu's Graduate Student application, True Monarch Azure Void frowned inwardly, though his expression remained impassive.

---

"A graduate student already?"

"Time flies."

Zhang Yu gazed at the notification floating before his bionic eye, a wave of melancholy washing over him.

He had been officially approved for undergraduate graduation by the university and admitted as a graduate student in the Artifact Refinement Department at Myriad Laws University. His mentor remained Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Normally, as a graduate student, he would have been assigned to study and live on the Kunxu Third Layer campus. However, due to the cataclysmic changes sweeping the world, he was now required to remain on the Second Layer.

This thought reminded Zhang Yu of Mo Shangjin. "Mo Shangjin had already been recommended for graduate studies on the Third Layer. If he hadn't given up his recommendation to retake the entrance exam for the Artifact Refinement Department, he wouldn't have returned to the Second Layer. He narrowly avoided being trapped by the lockdown and remained here."

As a graduate student, Zhang Yu's benefits had naturally improved. The university had even assigned him his own private laboratory, eliminating the need to rent Ye Xingli's lab.

In addition to his graduate-level courses, he would also need to maintain regular communication with his mentor.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: You should understand that I definitely don't have time to give you lessons right now.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: I've already sent you all the teaching materials. If you have any questions, go find True Monarch String Tone. He'll guide you.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: But artifact refinement isn't urgent. Your main task now is to cultivate Kunlun in the Palm and advance this Immortal Sect Technique to level 30 as soon as possible.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole: In the upcoming great battle, how effectively you can use Kunlun in the Palm will be crucial.

As Zhang Yu read Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's message, he thought to himself, "Level 30? That's not enough! If others find out, they'll think I lack talent. I need to reach at least level 40!"

Now a graduate student, Zhang Yu had only one goal in mind.

"I'm going to break through to Nascent Soul! And push Kunlun in the Palm to level 40!"

To achieve Nascent Soul, Zhang Yu knew the first requirement was numerical: he needed to raise his dao heart to level 30, his physical strength to level 30.00, and his Magic Power to 10,000 units.

Having secured funding from Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, Zhang Yu planned to invest the majority of it into his personal cultivation.

Shortly after, Zhang Yu, accompanied by his assistants Liu Xiangqiao, Zi Yunzhen, Su Yunni, and others, took possession of the new laboratory.

The assistants were thrilled by the more spacious environment and advanced equipment.

Zhang Yu, however, announced, "I intend to lease out most of the laboratory space and equipment."

"My primary focus now is my own cultivation. Artifact refinement will not be my immediate priority. You may stay and continue assisting with basic tasks while awaiting the future resumption of the artifact refinement project."

The assistants exchanged glances. Liu Xiangqiao spoke up, "I'm willing to stay."

Zi Yunzhen, Su Yunni, and the others quickly echoed her willingness to remain.

Zhang Yu nodded in acknowledgment and contacted Ye Xingli to help him lease out the laboratory.

He then resumed his focused cultivation.

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

---

Early December.

In Zhang Yu's dormitory, various magical artifacts and daoist arts swirled around him. Some infused Medicinal Power into his body, while others transformed into Thunderfire to temper his flesh and blood, or helped him restore Magic Power.

Several Teachers from the Dao Techniques Department continuously cast daoist arts to enhance his mental acuity, increase his reaction speed, and replenish his physical stamina.

Meanwhile, the Dragon-Tiger Elixir, a potent drug from the Pharmacy Institute's laboratory with severe side effects, surged wildly through Zhang Yu's veins.

Simultaneously, the Remnant Ox's Self-Sacrifice Heart Sutra and the Immeasurable Heart Inner Dharma Body, both at the Golden Core Realm, roared incessantly within Zhang Yu's mind, driving his dao heart to grow stronger.

Zhang Yu still remembered his first encounter with daoist arts services during his freshman year. The fees, ranging from 0.03 to 0.09 Spirit Coins per hour, had seemed too extravagant to afford. Back then, he calculated that daily use would cost dozens of Spirit Coins per month — an unimaginable luxury.

Now, with Golden Core Stage daoist arts services being even more expensive, Zhang Yu had hired several practitioners on a monthly retainer.

When combined with the enhancements from various magical artifacts and medicinal elixirs, the results were astonishing.

Within a month, both the Remnant Ox's Self-Sacrifice Heart Sutra and the Immeasurable Heart Inner Dharma Body had broken through to the Golden Core Realm. His dao heart had also advanced from Level 22 (78.56%) to Level 23 (27.88%).

As he directly pushed several Body Refinement Techniques to Level 30, his physical strength surged repeatedly, rising from Level 23.46 to Level 24.45.

Simultaneously, the Magic Power circulating within his body, fueled by the Level 30 Golden Core breathing technique, was constantly increasing his reserves.

This was due to the 24-hour continuous application of daoist arts, which accelerated Zhang Yu's progress. He completed the cultivation of ten Body Refinement Techniques far ahead of schedule and then advanced a passively operating breathing technique to Level 30 as well.

As a result, his Magic Power had surged in recent days, reaching 2935.

In just one month, Zhang Yu felt his foundational stats had already approached the mid-Golden Core Stage.

But the greatest achievement was that his Golden Core Sacred Body had broken through the three layers, achieving complete mastery.

Basic - Golden Core Sacred Body (6/6): Dao Foundation can be enhanced by one level. This effect remains active even after switching from the Chain Method Diagram Set.

Advanced - Golden Core Sacred Body (8/8): One additional Extraordinary Meridian can be opened. This effect remains active even after switching from the Chain Method Diagram Set.

Ultimate - Golden Core Sacred Body (10/10): Cultivation efficiency and effectiveness of all Golden Core Cultivation Techniques are doubled.

"Hah..." Zhang Yu exhaled, growing increasingly satisfied with the Golden Core Sacred Body the more he studied it.

"The effects of the First and Second Layers remain active even after switching from the Chain Method Diagram, truly raising my upper limits."

"The final layer grants me significantly enhanced cultivation efficiency."

Zhang Yu knew that his cultivation speed would now skyrocket once again, propelling him to a new level.

In addition to these enhancements, Zhang Yu's body had also established two top-tier Dao Foundations through repeated Potion injections: Vajra Subduing Demons, which grants additional damage reduction, and Formless Wind-and-Thunder, which increases his physical body's resistance to shockwaves and lightning.

Zhang Yu's strategy was clear: his physical body should prioritize resilience and survivability, ensuring constant safety. As for offensive capabilities, he could rely on his Bionics, magical artifacts, formations, and other tools.

Especially in the Kunxu Second Layer, where death is irreversible, safety is paramount.

Therefore, his plan was to develop all twelve plus one additional Dao Foundation layer primarily towards defense.

"From now on, my cultivation will focus on physical strength. I'll push it to level 30 in one go, reaching the peak of the Golden Core Stage!"

However, Zhang Yu knew that the luxurious cultivation he had enjoyed over the past month had come at a steep price. The 24-hour monthly subscription to daoist arts services alone had cost him several hundred Spirit Coins.

While other resources were cheaper than daoist arts services, their prices were rising daily.

"Based on my progress since obtaining the Golden Core Sacred Body, I estimate it will take about three months to raise my physical strength to level 30. But if prices keep rising at this rate, my current funds and savings will likely be exhausted by then."

Rising prices!

The mere thought of those words made Zhang Yu's brow furrow involuntarily.

Just then, a message popped up in his Bionic Eye — a photo sent by Le Mulan.

It showed a long queue outside the Pharmacy Institute, filled with students who had arrived early to buy medicine.

With material shortages causing a decline in medicine production, every resident of University City was now limited in how much medicine they could purchase.

Despite these restrictions, long queues still formed daily outside pharmacies. Each time a clerk announced that the medicine was sold out, loud complaints would erupt from the back of the line.

Of course, Zhang Yu, thanks to his status as a second-generation university elite, didn't need to queue. He could obtain medicine through back channels.

Le Mulan had been frequently running errands for him lately, using the opportunity to acquire some cultivation medicines for herself as well.

Le Mulan: Medicine prices have gone up again.

Zhang Yu sighed. Even with his connections as a university elite, the sheer number of people with influence in University City meant that the price of medicine he could obtain kept rising, while the quantity available steadily decreased.

A moment later, Feng Tingting sent Zhang Yu another message: Senior, have you heard? Another person died in the lower levels of University City. Apparently, it was a conflict over resources — two Qi Refining students got into a fight.

Feng Tingting: I heard they're already selling monsterfolk slaves outside. Things are getting more chaotic by the day. Do you have any news?

Zhang Yu sighed. Although he could now connect to the Spirit Realm during the day, most information was blocked by the school's higher-ups. He was focused entirely on his cultivation and remained largely unaware of the outside world unless he made a conscious effort to learn about it.

"Is it getting more chaotic?" Zhang Yu thought, recalling the Vocational College Teachers who had raided the factory earlier.

Soon after, someone else approached Zhang Yu, hoping to communicate with Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Zhang Yu had encountered similar requests frequently over the past month, all seeking to reach Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole through him.

However, all four Divine Monarchs in University City were currently in secluded cultivation, completely immersed in their practice and consuming vast quantities of resources to advance their Soul Transformation cultivation. They rarely responded to messages, and Zhang Yu naturally wouldn't disturb his Soul Transformation Master.

Glancing at the news in the Spirit Realm, Zhang Yu saw comments claiming that True Monarch Azure Void had already retaken multiple campuses in the southeast and rebuilt the logistics network, suggesting that prices would soon stabilize.

Some praised True Monarch Azure Void, arguing he deserved to ascend to Soul Transformation, while others immediately countered that if he became a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch, he would stop working, retreat into secluded cultivation, and compete with the people for resources, causing prices to skyrocket even further.

Zhang Yu wanted to refresh the page, but the comments had already disappeared.

He thought to himself, "Sigh, even before the external supply dwindled, resources were already scarce. Now, with four new Soul Transformation cultivators needing to cultivate, plus more newly advanced Nascent Soul, Golden Core, and Foundation Establishment cultivators also needing to cultivate, how could prices not skyrocket?"

"Master Magnetic Pole probably left behind a Soul Transformation Certificate with this in mind. Otherwise, if all five Soul Transformation cultivators were to cultivate in University City together, the whole system might truly collapse."

Several days later, Zhang Yu unexpectedly received a message from Su Yanyang.

"You want to come for a job interview at my company?"

Su Yanyang looked full of energy, completely shedding his former listless demeanor and seemingly returning to his old self.

"Prices are rising too fast," Su Yanyang said. "If I don't start working soon, I won't be able to afford to live."

He added with a sigh, "It wasn't until I was completely broke that I realized money is even more important than I thought."

"Don't worry, I've completely reformed myself and passed the Dual Rest Virus test. I'll work diligently at your company and won't hold anyone back."

Su Yanyang's own company had long since gone bankrupt, and his extended period of unemployment had already made finding a job difficult. Now, he was facing the most challenging job market in recent history.

As material supplies dwindled, numerous factories reduced production, leading to mass layoffs and a surplus of skilled workers.

This coincided with a surge in cultivators achieving breakthroughs, resulting in Nascent Soul cultivators competing for Golden Core jobs, Golden Core cultivators vying for Foundation Establishment positions, and Foundation Establishment cultivators scrambling for Qi Refining roles.

Even during the economic crisis triggered by the last Soul Transformation War, employment prospects had never been this dire.

Faced with repeated rejections, Su Yanyang had no choice but to approach Zhang Yu as a last resort.

After experiencing such dramatic highs and lows in life, Su Yanyang's demeanor had undergone a complete transformation. Gone was his former arrogance and defiance, replaced by a newfound composure and humility.

Zhang Yu scanned Su Yanyang's resume, met his gaze, and finally nodded. "Welcome aboard. But let me be clear: if you show any signs of your Dual Rest Disease resurfacing, I'll have to let you go. I have a responsibility to my other colleagues."

Su Yanyang, who had already braced himself for rejection, was stunned by the offer. He took a deep breath and slowly replied, "Zhang Yu... thank you. Thank you for being willing to help me."

Even when Su Yanyang was at his wealthiest, he had never had any true friends. He had even become bitter enemies with his teammate Shi Huaiyu over a kidney.

Yet now, in his most desperate hour, this junior brother who had long surpassed him was offering a helping hand.

Zhang Yu continued, "You're familiar with my company's current projects, right? They can be a bit dangerous."

Su Yanyang nodded. "I know. It involves traveling to rebuild the outer campuses and logistics networks."

As each outer campus was reclaimed, the areas ravaged by rogue cultivators needed repair and restoration to resume operations.

This led to an unprecedented boom in the civil engineering industry, with vast numbers of students pouring out to work on long-term projects across the country.

Even Yu Xinghan temporarily left the healthcare sector to join the construction efforts.

Zhang Yu's company, with its strong ties to the Civil Engineering Department, naturally secured numerous contracts.

With the issuance of various certifications, Shi Huaiyu obtained her Military Certificate, allowing her to openly wield the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power and lead a construction team in the field.

Yu Xinghan, having recently broken through to the Golden Core Realm, led another team, securing numerous projects and providing a degree of security with his Golden Core cultivation.

Thinking of Yu Xinghan, Zhang Yu immediately recalled the man's Third Eye Mystic Power.

"To reach the 4th-tier of the Third Eye Mystic Power, I need to help Yu Xinghan accumulate 8,000 units of Magic Power. This will take time."

In addition to this, Zhang Yu had originally intended to invite True Person Starfire to join his company, but the offer was rejected.

The True Person, along with Li Xuelian, had vanished into the wilderness, their whereabouts unknown.

Zhang Yu muttered to himself, "Could they have become bandits, resorting to robbery?"

He shook his head, suppressing the wild speculation.

After accepting Su Yanyang, Zhang Yu glanced at the remaining thousands of resumes and thought, "I can't possibly hire this many people."

Considering the large number of unemployed individuals gathering in University City, Zhang Yu understood why crime rates had been rising recently.

Recalling Feng Tingting's earlier mention of a murder case, Zhang Yu realized such incidents would likely become increasingly common. After all, while Soul Cultivators could monitor the city, they couldn't constantly prevent and punish rogue cultivators.

"According to my sister..."

Several days later, Zhang Yu received a message from Zhang Pianpian, confirming his suspicions.

"Security forces below the 300th floor of University City have been withdrawn because maintaining them there wasn't profitable — the costs outweighed the benefits."

"Now, the distinction between the upper and lower floors has become even starker: the upper floors are exclusively for the wealthy, while the lower floors are for the poor, with vastly different security environments."

As Zhang Yu read through the rest of his sister's messages, he couldn't help but sigh.

He had never imagined that with the disappearance of the Righteous Gods, Talisman Department technology, after several rounds of environmental adaptation updates, would become increasingly sought after. Like the Civil Engineering and Security Departments, it had become one of the few industries experiencing growth against the prevailing trend.

"It's not hard to understand," he mused. "Kunxu's Immortal Dao Technology has always evolved and adapted to its environment. The need to suppress cultivation levels led to the Shattered Core technique, and the desire to avoid medical expenses spurred the development of various combat tactics."

"Now, with the war raging and the Righteous Gods gone, Immortal Dao Technology will undoubtedly evolve in new directions..."

As he read Zhang Pianpian's messages, Zhang Yu's thoughts turned to her Dao Seed, the Great Purity Talisman.

"Upgrading the Great Purity Talisman to the 3rd-tier requires 1,000 Spirit Coins..."
