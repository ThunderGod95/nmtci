# Chapter 210: Hidden Crisis, Dark Tutoring

Just as Zhang Yu's request was met, Bai Zhenzhen spoke up again. "I remember the school has a lot of equipment for cultivation, even magical treasures, right? Can we borrow some to use?"

Hearing this, Zhou Chechen felt another wave of helplessness, a pained look on his face as he asked, "What do you want?"

Bai Zhenzhen said, "The Umbral Thunder Electro-Acupuncture Set."

"Hehe, can you lend me that set of magical cultivation treasures imported from the Second Layer to play with?"

Bai Zhenzhen had long coveted this magical cultivation treasure at the school; it was just that she could never afford to rent it before.

Zhou Chechen sighed helplessly at her words. "Although this Umbral Thunder Electro-Acupuncture Set is an old magical treasure discarded by the Second Layer, it is an extremely rare item here in our Songyang City."

"Even if I were to propose that the school lend it to you for free, I would have to pay a considerable price."

He spoke with a pained expression, "If I didn't owe you two so much this time, I would never do such a thing."

"Eighty hours of rental a month for you. That's the absolute limit of what I can do."

This Umbral Thunder Electro-Acupuncture Set was composed of 999 intelligent silver needles capable of releasing the electricity stored within them to stimulate flesh and nerves, with a body tempering effect that reached the most minute parts of the body.

For Bai Zhenzhen, who possessed thunder magic power and a True Spiritual Root, this set would not only allow her to temper her body with electricity at all times but also replenish her thunder magic power and accelerate the efficiency of her cultivation technique.

Notably, this magical treasure also had a built-in basic artifact spirit capable of automatically performing different acupuncture techniques to achieve various levels of body tempering effects.

Fu Ji commented, "This Umbral Thunder Electro-Acupuncture Set has already been phased out up there, but here on the first layer of Kunxu, it's still a decent magical treasure for cultivation. Once you borrow it, Zhang Yu, you can use it as well to enhance your neural reflex speed and explosive power."

"Unfortunately, this basic artifact spirit is networked. Without paying, you can't use the advanced body tempering acupuncture techniques developed by the company."

"If you had a powerful artifact refinement master, they could disconnect it from the network, erase the artifact spirit within, and crack the advanced services."

"But don't even think about it, especially since you're just borrowing it."

"Oh, right, the Umbral Thunder Electro-Acupuncture Set has a pretty high power consumption. Remember to charge it at school."

So Bai Zhenzhen added, "Then I'll just leave this Umbral Thunder Electro-Acupuncture Set at school to charge in the future."

Zhou Chechen nodded slightly. Having already paid such a steep price, he didn't mind a small electricity bill.

A question, however, arose in Zhang Yu's mind. He typed on his phone to ask, "Speaking of which, since this kind of magical treasure needs charging, can't it be charged with lightning?"

Fu Ji looked at the words appearing on the phone and chuckled. "Charge it with lightning?"

"How many times have you seen it rain in Songyang City, or heard thunder?"

"All natural climates are planned in advance by the Eight Ministries of Righteous Gods. Changing the climate requires a massive amount of capital."

"Besides, lightning contains a huge amount of Immortal Dao elements and energy. You think they'll just strike you for free? Where would you find such a good deal?"

Zhang Yu was speechless. Only then did he recall that in his and his predecessor's memories, he really hadn't seen much thunder or rain. It was just that he used to be too weak and too poor, with too great an information gap regarding Kunxu, leaving him completely ignorant of the secrets behind the weather.

Having negotiated to this point, Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen, and Zhou Chechen all felt they had basically pushed the other party to their limit. No matter how much more they talked... Zhou Chechen couldn't produce any more resources.

However, the two were already very satisfied with their gains this time.

More flexible class schedules, practical combat sparring with martial dao teachers, and access to all of Songyang High School's cultivation techniques.

There were also the Spirit Realm slots for training their Dao hearts, a Resentment Spiritual Root to match the Resentful Baleful Art, and the magical cultivation treasure, the Umbral Thunder Electro-Acupuncture Set.

On top of that, there was 1.5 million in cash for each of them.

_With this wave of support from Zhou Chechen,_ Zhang Yu thought to himself, _the success rate for my next attempt at the Foundation Establishment license exam has greatly increased._

Looking utterly exhausted, Zhou Chechen said, "If there are no other issues, you two... shall we sign the contract?"

Fu Ji reminded him again, "Wait, ask Deng Bingding first. Ask for her guidance on whether this is acceptable."

"Remember, this is a technique for getting along with righteous gods. Always ask for instructions on matters involving money."

"Also, remember to say that you and Bai Zhenzhen will give her the three million you receive."

Zhang Yu's typing fingers froze, a sudden reluctance filling his heart.

Fu Ji chuckled. "Hehe, no need to be reluctant. Deng Bingding won't take it."

Half-convinced, Zhang Yu sent a message to Deng Bingding, explaining the compensation agreement on his end.

Deng Bingding replied: I understand.

Then, Zhang Yu expressed his intention to transfer the three million to Deng Bingding.

Deng Bingding replied: What nonsense are you talking about? Don't get me in trouble. Keep the money for yourself. We righteous gods support Kunxu and govern the world for the trillions of living beings above and below. Don't say such things in front of me again.

Fu Ji said, "Hehe, these righteous gods, their ordinary transfers are all monitored. So, apart from Favorability Talismans, they don't accept normal money transfers."

"She knows you don't know how to use a Favorability Talisman. Just expressing your sentiment is enough; it will increase her favorability all the same."

Zhang Yu typed on the screen to ask, "Then did the Zhou family also give a Favorability Talisman this time?"

Fu Ji denied it. "The Favorability Talisman was likely just a small part of it, a little gift for the righteous god."

"The fine that can be handed over to the Divine Ministry, that's probably the main part. This kind of cash-recovery performance is likely more important to Deng Bingding."

After signing the contract in the mediation room, Zhou Chechen finally breathed a sigh of relief and quickly sent a message to inform his father of the situation here.

Then he turned to Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen and said, "You two, I've already had someone transfer the money. I'll send someone to escort you back to school to fulfill the contract shortly."

Watching the departing backs of Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, Zhou Chechen collapsed into his chair. He gripped his phone tightly, a look of anguish and frustration appearing on his face.

Then he saw Yue Jincheng and Si Zhouyu still kneeling to the side and said coldly, "What are you two still doing here?"

"The company has paid so much for you this time. Aren't you going to get to work immediately to pay it back?"

Just as he dismissed Yue Jincheng and Si Zhouyu, a call came from Lan Ling.

He heard him rage, "President, why was my Spirit Realm slot canceled? This is a critical moment for me in my third year of high school..."

"You've heard about what happened with the Myriad Stars Group, haven't you?" Zhou Chechen snorted coldly and said, "A sixth-rank righteous god locked down the entire group, even investigating the Zhou family estate."

"Do you know why?"

Lan Ling was slightly taken aback. He had indeed heard this news, which was why he had the confidence to question Zhou Chechen.

Zhou Chechen continued, "Because of Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen."

"The one backing them is that very sixth-rank righteous god, a righteous god who can lock down the entire Myriad Stars Group without needing any reason."

At this moment, Zhou Chechen naturally didn't know that Deng Bingding was able to do this because she had raised the banner of the Foundation Establishment exam.

Of course, since those in the know couldn't disclose related information, to uninformed individuals like Zhou Chechen and Lan Ling, it simply appeared that Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had an astonishingly powerful backer.

Zhou Chechen said, "Lan Ling, you don't want Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen to target you, do you?"

"I remember you said something about finding someone to cripple them..."

Lan Ling hastily replied, "President! I've thought about it, and I don't want the Spirit Realm slot anymore."

Zhou Chechen added, "I just compensated Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen five million..."

Lan Ling said, "I understand. Is 800,000 from me alright?"

"That's all the cash I have on hand."

After hanging up, Zhou Chechen sighed to himself again. "Lan Ling, if everyone in Songyang City were like you, how wonderful this world would be."

"Sigh, I wonder how much the family lost this time."

---

"The losses are devastating."

In a hospital room on the 333rd floor of the central tower.

Zhou Yang looked at the empty wardrobe, thinking of how half of his lower body's assets had been sold off, and sighed internally. "The Foundation Establishment exam, what a useful banner this is."

"When brought down, it's truly unstoppable, something no one dares to block."

"That Deng Bingding really managed to bite off a huge chunk of flesh."

As the person primarily responsible for this incident, Zhou Yang bore the brunt of the losses. It could be said that he had been bled dry, but he had ultimately survived this ordeal.

After all, he had long been aware of the intelligence that they were participating in the Foundation Establishment exam. If not for possessing this information advantage and failing to yield from the start, he likely would have had to pay an even greater price.

Of course, his status as a Purple-Gold Merit Master and the mediation of a familiar righteous god also played a significant role.

Although the losses were immense, Zhou Yang didn't see this matter as a total loss.

Through inquiries made by his acquainted righteous god, Zhou Yang was fairly certain that this Deng Bingding was primarily using the Foundation Establishment exam to make money, and was not some backer of Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

"Ultimately, this matter of the Foundation Establishment exam was ten times more troublesome than I anticipated. It's truly something one cannot even touch."

"However... Hmph, if this Righteous God Deng were to find out that the Zhang Yu she's helping is a follower of an evil god, what fate would await her?"

Zhou Yang thought to himself, "Let's wait until after the Foundation Establishment exam is over."

"It would be even better if Zhang Yu can pass the exam and get his Foundation Establishment license. This fish would then be fatter, fresher, and more valuable."

A sliver of vicious coldness appeared in Zhou Yang's eyes. "Hehe, as long as I hold this leverage of Zhang Yu being an evil god's follower."

"In the future, without the cover of the Foundation Establishment exam, not only can I use this leverage to control this person."

"This Righteous God Deng will absolutely have to pay the price as well."

"As for now..."

Looking at his phone, at the various questions and complaints coming from the family and the company, Zhou Yang understood that for the next three months, until Zhang Yu's Foundation Establishment exam was over, he could only bide his time.

After a busy night, the sky was now faintly lit.

Songyang High School.

Zhang Yu received the Resentment Spiritual Root, which he could rent for 100 hours a month for free. He was currently sensing the towering resentment in the campus, trying to absorb it with the spiritual root.

Bai Zhenzhen, on the other hand, was toying with her newly acquired Umbral Thunder Electro-Acupuncture Set, which she could also rent for 80 hours a month for free. She smiled faintly, watching the electric sparks flicker between her fingertips.

Just then, both of their phones vibrated. Electronic versions of all of Songyang High School's cultivation techniques had been sent to them at once.

Simultaneously, under the authorization of Songyang High School, they now possessed the right to use these techniques.

Next was Songyang High School's Spirit Realm user manual.

There were also the contact details for all the martial dao teachers, who had already been notified about individually tutoring Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

Of course, the specific class times still needed to be arranged after Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen contacted them.

Besides all this, there was the 1.5 million that had arrived in each of their accounts.

Taking stock of her gains, Bai Zhenzhen said with deep satisfaction, "Awesome."

"This is so damn awesome."

"Isn't this so much more than what we earned from slaving away at part-time jobs?"

"Yu-boy, do you think we could extort all the powerful families in Songyang like this?"

But before Zhang Yu could answer, Bai Zhenzhen shook her head. "Sigh, that's probably impossible. If Deng Bingding really did that, the Divine Ministry would surely not allow it."

Just then, Fu Ji reminded them, "Although the Zhou family gave you a lot, this matter isn't over."

"From our previous discussion, it seems there's a suspected evil god behind them. And judging by the words of that Zhou Tianyi who attacked Zhang Yu, they might even know about my existence."

Zhang Yu asked, puzzled, "Speaking of which, how would they know about that?"

Fu Ji sighed. "Hehe, it was probably passed on by the one who betrayed me."

"Thinking about it now, the Zhou family's disgusting pressure on you might have been to force me out of hiding."

"But that's not important anymore."

"What's important is the evil god behind the Zhou family, who might be holding the leverage of you being followers of an evil god."

"His bowing down and yielding now is only because of the Foundation Establishment exam."

"Once the exam is over, that guy will definitely retaliate."

"That's why I said this matter isn't over. You two need to be prepared."

"Because of your status as followers of an evil god, when the time comes to completely resolve this hidden danger, you won't be able to rely on righteous gods. You'll need to rely on your own strength to solve it."

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen nodded, but these were matters to be dealt with after the Foundation Establishment exam.

Their most important goal right now was still to defeat Ye Lingxiao and Yun Jing in the exam three months later.

Zhang Yu toyed with the newly acquired Resentment Spiritual Root and first bought the Resentful Baleful Art that could be used in conjunction with it.

-500,000

Watching a third of the 1.5 million he just received vanish in an instant, Zhang Yu once again lamented how quickly the Immortal Dao burned through money.

Then, Zhang Yu selected an expert-level cultivation technique called the Thunderclap Marrow-Washing Scripture from Songyang High School's collection.

"Resentful Baleful Art, Thunderclap Marrow-Washing Scripture, and Spring and Autumn Endless Zen. That makes three of the cultivation techniques needed for the Martial Dao Holy Embryo."

"I just need to gather three more techniques, push them all to level 10, and these six level-10 techniques will unlock the effect of the primary Martial Dao Holy Embryo."

Thinking of this, Zhang Yu felt he was another step closer to obtaining the Foundation Establishment license.

"But from now on, I'll have to rely on myself to make money."

Zhang Yu asked, "Fu Ji, according to what you said last time, our current strength should be enough to earn some big money in the dark world of tutoring, right?"

"It is indeed enough."

Zhang Yu asked, "So what's the plan?"

"You two should first go to the district to investigate. Ask which course is the most popular in Songyang City's dark world of tutoring right now, which tutor has the most students..."

Thus, for the remainder of the day, no longer bound by school discipline, Zhang Yu directly began cultivating the Resentful Baleful Art, while Bai Zhenzhen cultivated and attempted to temper her body with the Umbral Thunder Electro-Acupuncture Set.

The two planned to cultivate until nightfall, then make a trip to the Dark Learning Gang's district, a place they hadn't been to in a long time.
