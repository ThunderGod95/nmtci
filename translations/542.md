# Chapter 542: Spring for Civil Engineering, Company Expansion

"Demonic Sect's Insane Attack: Spirit Vein Meltdown Causes Over a Thousand Casualties! Experts Estimate Repair Costs at Tens of Thousands of Spirit Coins!"

"Demonic Sect Hijacks Spirit Realm: University City's Defense Formation Becomes Accomplice to Massacre! Citywide Formation Urgently Needs Upgrading!"

"Multiple Primordial Magnetic Channels Severely Damaged: Once the City's Lifeline, Now a Life-Devouring Beast! University City Issues Red Alert, Suspends All Primordial Magnetic Channel Operations, and Promises Swift Repairs!"

As Tu Lishan read these news reports, he sighed, "The Demonic Sect is truly ruthless. Not only did they plunder everywhere, but they also destroyed the University City's Anti-Gravity Passages, Primordial Magnetic Channels, Magic Power Circuits, Spiritual Energy Circuits, and various gravity, temperature, and humidity control devices."

"They even wrecked the citywide Formation, sparing not even the student dormitories. The Demonic Sect is utterly despicable! Damn it... why didn't they tear down the teachers' dormitories too?"

"Fellow students, in the days ahead, we face a monumental task. The speed at which we can repair the city depends entirely on us. We must not disappoint the teachers and students across the city."

Tu Lishan thought to himself, "Ah, if the Demonic Sect could attack once a year, Civil Engineering would undoubtedly become the top department in Myriad Laws."

Seeing the barely suppressed smile on Tu Lishan's face, Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang exchanged nervous glances.

Ying Xin muttered to herself, "Damn... we only sabotaged one Primordial Magnetic Channel's Magic Power Circuit, right?"

Shi Yunxiang asked, "Who the hell blew up all the Primordial Magnetic Channels across the entire city?"

Originally, the unemployment crisis had been gradually easing after the economic downturn.

But within Myriad Laws University's University City, the deaths, bankruptcies, and disappearances of many people had led to a scramble for workers.

Moreover, the Demonic Sect's massive destruction had triggered numerous infrastructure projects, making Civil Engineering students highly sought after. They entered a golden age of daily overtime, relishing the constant work.

Zhang Yu observed the bustling construction sites, watching the workers' faces glow with post-overtime radiance and genuine smiles. He had to admit that the Demonic Sect's attack had somehow revitalized the University City's economy.

Lady Fortune remarked, "That's how Kunxu works. Sometimes it's a contest of endurance. Those who survive a major calamity get to reap the rewards."

Zhang Yu nodded, resolving to seize this opportunity to earn well and prepare for refining his prototype machine.

Following this, Zhang Yu, acting on behalf of his company, secured numerous projects from the Artifact Refinement Department.

While the Civil Engineering Department was indispensable for the reconstruction efforts across University City, many projects were jointly managed with the Artifact Refinement Department.

For instance, the city-wide Primordial Magnetic Channel and Anti-Gravity Passage were joint ventures, with the Artifact Refinement Department responsible for manufacturing and deploying the specialized equipment.

Leveraging his affiliation with the Artifact Refinement Department and his connection to True Monarch Magnetic Pole, Zhang Yu secured numerous projects that were small in scale but highly profitable.

However, as the number of projects across the city surged, skilled workers became increasingly scarce.

After all, a larger workforce meant higher construction efficiency, allowing companies to take on more projects and complete them faster.

Zhang Yu's current staff was clearly insufficient to meet his needs.

Thus, with the economic crisis subsiding, Zhang Yu embarked on another expansion of his company.

His first recruits were the Civil Engineering Department students who had shared his recent financial hardships.

Tu Lishan frowned at Ying Xin, who stood before him. "Are you sure you want to leave? We're about to get a raise here. And the projects are piling up — you'll be working overtime until graduation!

Besides, aren't you already working part-time as an accountant for Zhang Yu? Isn't that enough?"

When Ying Xin heard the words "salary increase," she paused, a flicker of interest crossing her face.

After a moment's thought, she replied, "I've already promised Zhang Yu I'll join his company. I'll be doing accounting while also working on construction sites."

Tu Lishan sighed helplessly. "Ah, how can Zhang Yu's new company compare to our established reputation?

"Tell you what, you can go for now, but my door will always be open for your return."

At that moment, projects were springing up all over University City, and Tu Lishan's team was desperately short-staffed. Every additional worker meant more profit, and the students were being treated better than ever before.

Shortly after Ying Xin left, Shi Yunxiang approached Tu Lishan with the same request.

Hearing that Yunxiang also planned to join Zhang Yu's company, Tu Lishan couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, thinking, "How much money did Zhang Yu spend poaching all these people?"

The next day, when Xiao Qingxuan announced his intention to transfer as well, Tu Lishan was even more surprised. "Have you thought this through carefully?"

"Finding a job after graduation isn't easy, especially with a company affiliated with the department — a well-respected name in the Civil Engineering Realm."

"If I were you, I'd stick it out here for at least ten years, build a solid foundation, and accumulate experience instead of jumping to some unproven startup."

Xiao Qingxuan insisted, "Teacher, I've made up my mind. Please let me go."

---

After days of Zhang Yu poaching his staff, Tu Lishan couldn't help feeling resentful. But considering Zhang Yu's backing from True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Director Gao, he pretended nothing had happened.

One day, seeing Zhang Yu leading his team at the construction site, Tu Lishan greeted him with a smile.

Noticing Zhang Yu distributing various Tiger Wolf Medicines, Tu Lishan asked, "Do you give these to your employees every day?"

Zhang Yu replied, "It makes them work like beasts."

Tu Lishan thought to himself, "A new boss really changes things. Even the strongest constitutions can't withstand this daily abuse."

Yet seeing Shi Yunxiang and the others willingly take the medicine, Tu Lishan secretly gave Zhang Yu a thumbs-up. "Impressive," he muttered.

He texted Zhang Yu: "You've really mastered employee management."

Zhang Yu naturally couldn't reveal that their Profound Cold Magic Bionics (his and Le Mulan's) combined with Xiao Qingxuan's Ancient Medical Techniques neutralized the Tiger Wolf Medicine's side effects.

Instead, he replied: "Just a few tricks."

Tu Lishan: "These aren't mere tricks. Getting them to take the medicine willingly must have taken considerable effort, right?"

Tu Lishan: We should exchange experiences sometime. I'm genuinely curious about Zhang Yu's methods for managing employees — how he manages to squeeze them so ruthlessly.

Just as the two men exchanged knowing smiles, Shi Huaiyu approached them. "Master," she said, "I'm planning to join Zhang Yu's company."

If Xiao Qingxuan's departure had merely surprised Tu Lishan, Shi Huaiyu's defection angered him.

Especially now that Shi Huaiyu had become a top-priority student in the Civil Engineering Department, possessing the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering. With a high probability of obtaining the Military Certificate and mastering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, she was the disciple Tu Lishan considered to have the highest potential return on investment.

The thought of this promising disciple joining Zhang Yu's company, only to be ruthlessly exploited, made Tu Lishan take a deep breath. Golden Magic Power Circuits glowed across his Bionic body, indicating a surge in his Magic Power circulation.

Staring at the graceful figure before him, Tu Lishan couldn't help but ask, "You're going to Zhang Yu's company too?"

When Shi Huaiyu nodded, Tu Lishan glanced around, unwilling for others to overhear their conversation. He immediately sent her a private message: "Foolish!"

Tu Lishan: Why would you leave a reputable Civil Engineering firm to work for Zhang Yu's newly established company?

Tu Lishan: Don't think your relationship is special just because you competed together. He'll only use that to pressure your company and exploit you even more ruthlessly.

Shi Huaiyu opened her mouth, wanting to say so much, but found herself unable to articulate her thoughts. In the end, all her words condensed into a single sentence.

Shi Huaiyu: Zhang Yu is different.

Tu Lishan exclaimed in anguish, "Different? How is he different?"

Tu Lishan: Let me tell you, all company bosses are the same! I know exactly what's going through their minds!

Tu Lishan: Their heads are filled with nothing but greed and schemes to exploit you — how to cut your wages, make you work harder for less pay!

Tu Lishan: Listen to your Master. Stay here, work hard, and after graduation, you'll become a full-time employee and move into management.

Shi Huaiyu said helplessly, "Master, I've already promised Zhang Yu."

Tu Lishan continued to plead, "Shi Huaiyu, I've trained you for years, not so you'd waste your life on construction sites, but so you could rise above them and help me make real money!"

Shi Huaiyu: Master, Zhang Yu really is different.

Shi Huaiyu: I believe I can earn far more by working for him.

Shi Huaiyu: Anyway, I'm definitely going to work for Zhang Yu's company.

Shi Huaiyu: My employment with the department is only temporary anyway. If you don't approve, that's fine.

Watching Shi Huaiyu turn and run after Zhang Yu's retreating figure, Tu Lishan sent a message: If you dare go, don't even think about working overtime when you come back!

Shi Huaiyu: Don't worry, Master. Zhang Yu promised to have me working 24/7 once I join.

Seeing Shi Huaiyu accept the Tiger Wolf Medicine from Zhang Yu's hand and swallow it without hesitation, Tu Lishan felt a pang of heartache.

Tu Lishan: Is he lying to you about getting you into the Artifact Refinement Department?

Tu Lishan: Let me tell you, bosses are all liars. Don't believe a word they say. He can't get you into the Artifact Refinement Department.

Shi Huaiyu: Zhang Yu didn't say anything like that.

Shi Huaiyu: I just want to work for him.

Shi Huaiyu: Okay, let's talk later when I'm off work. President Zhang doesn't like employees chatting during work hours.

Watching Shi Huaiyu's diligent demeanor, Tu Lishan couldn't help but turn to Zhang Yu and send a message: Huaiyu is one of the department's top students, and we're planning to invest heavily in her development.

Tu Lishan: Give her less of that medicine. Don't ruin her health.

Zhang Yu: Don't worry, Teacher Tu. I'll be careful how I use her.

Tu Lishan gritted his teeth, thinking, "First Magnetic Pole, now Zhang Yu. Is the Artifact Refinement Department teaching students how to poach talent during class now?"

In addition to the Civil Engineering Department's Ying Xin, Shi Yunxiang, Xiao Qingxuan, and Shi Huaiyu, Zhang Yu naturally needed to recruit more Soul Cultivators to handle the workload.

Prioritizing cost-effectiveness, Zhang Yu recruited a group of bankrupt talents from the Songyang Hometown Group.

With this expansion, the team's construction efficiency skyrocketed, allowing Zhang Yu to take on more projects. His company's monthly income quickly approached 30 Spirit Coins.

More importantly, as the projects stabilized, Zhang Yu's direct involvement became increasingly minimal.

Lady Fortune even volunteered to handle various administrative tasks, overseeing finances and managing employees without compensation.

As a result, Zhang Yu only needed to spend a few days each month at construction sites, using his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to complete major tasks.

The company's income had essentially become passive income for him.

Combined with the 40 Spirit Coin laboratory subsidy, Zhang Yu now enjoyed ample free time while maintaining a monthly income of nearly 70 Spirit Coins.

With this financial security, Zhang Yu finally felt confident enough to begin refining the Heavenly Sun Radiance God prototype machine.
