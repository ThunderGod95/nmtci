# Chapter 417: The Allure of the Artifact Refinement Department

Zhang Yu was playing with the Golden Jade Wall in his hand.

This magical artifact was roughly the size of an average person's chest, resembling a flat, circular jade disc with a palm-sized hollow at its center.

Its surface was covered in a dense network of golden patterns, resembling intricate Magic Power Circuits that spanned the entire surface.

As Zhang Yu channeled his Magic Power into it, the Golden Jade Wall levitated into the air.

Simultaneously, parameters of the Golden Jade Wall appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye, including its Magic Power capacity, power output, operational duration, and more.

"Activate Follow Mode," Zhang Yu commanded softly.

Dao of faint light emerged from the Golden Jade Wall, locking onto Zhang Yu's presence.

The jade disc then slowly drifted behind him, hovering like a halo above his head, moving in sync with his movements.

In addition to Follow Mode, the Golden Jade Wall also featured Attack, Defense, and Free modes, each equipped with rudimentary intelligence to operate according to Zhang Yu's pre-set rules.

"Still, nothing beats the precision of manual control."

At Zhang Yu's mental command, the Golden Jade Wall behind his head emitted a brilliant radiance, illuminating the entire dormitory like a miniature sun.

However, Zhang Yu only activated the light emission function, refraining from activating any other features.

"It would be bad if I accidentally damaged anything in the dorm. I'll wait until I'm at the construction site to experiment further."

With this thought, Zhang Yu channeled Magic Power from both the Profound Cold Meridian and the Blazing Sun Meridian into the Golden Jade Wall.

He knew that the Wall's capabilities would vary dramatically depending on the specific type of Magic Power infused.

"With the Golden Jade Wall, my efficiency at the construction site should improve even further."

As he pondered this, Zhang Yu instinctively checked his bank balance: 36.15 Spirit Coins remaining.

Over the past few months, his income had steadily increased, thanks to Zhang Pianpian's monthly 5 Spirit Coin repayments, Wen Wuya's 10 Spirit Coin monthly subscription, and his relentless hard work at the construction site.

Yet Zhang Yu's savings had barely grown, primarily due to the exorbitant costs of artifact refinement.

Especially as his Artifact Refinement Technique advanced, the costs soared — both the Spirit Coins consumed in the simulation laboratory and the expenses for purchasing materials in the real world. Each step forward became exponentially more expensive.

It was only because Zhang Yu's fundamental attributes had gradually reached the Foundation Establishment Limit, eliminating the need to spend Spirit Coins on cultivation, that he managed to save a portion of his monthly expenses. Otherwise, his savings would have been even smaller.

"If it weren't for the subsidies from my full-time work at the construction site, my progress in artifact refinement would have been much slower."

Just as Zhang Yu was admiring the Golden Jade Wall, True Monarch Magnetic Pole sent him a message.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "The Golden Jade Wall is well-refined."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Here's a suggestion."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Have Xingli help you take orders. I've already mentioned it to her."

Zhang Yu's heart stirred slightly. "Do you mean taking orders for artifact refinement?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "You've mastered Azure Heaven Sand, Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill, and the Golden Jade Wall quite well now, haven't you?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "I know you lack capital and Spirit Coins to stockpile materials."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "So, take orders for artifact refinement and earn a crafting fee."

Zhang Yu was naturally eager to accept. Even earning just a crafting fee would undoubtedly be more efficient than working at the construction site.

Zhang Yu understood that the order volume would likely be small, as most people still preferred to purchase magical artifacts from large companies and established platforms.

However, even receiving two or three orders a month would provide a significant supplement to his cultivation practice.

With this in mind, Zhang Yu couldn't help but feel grateful to True Monarch Magnetic Pole. His teacher truly understood what he needed most right now.

Just then, True Monarch Magnetic Pole sent Zhang Yu another gift: a cultivation art called the "Treasure Appraisal Manual."

The Treasure Appraisal Manual, despite its simple-sounding name, was a cultivation art Zhang Yu had long known about but never purchased.

This was because the right to use the manual required a hefty 50 Spirit Coins upfront, plus a monthly renewal fee of 1 Spirit Coin.

The high cost stemmed from the manual's ability to appraise a wide range of magical artifacts and Bionics, which involved numerous copyrights for these items.

The monthly renewal fee was necessary because the Treasure Appraisal Manual was constantly being updated, incorporating newly discovered and created magical artifacts and Bionics from across Kunxu.

As one of the co-creators of the Treasure Appraisal Manual, True Monarch Magnetic Pole had a limited number of authorization slots each year.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Since you've chosen the path of Artifact Refinement, a fundamental ability to identify magical artifacts and Bionics is essential."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Consider this Treasure Appraisal Manual my gift to you for passing the Artifact Refinement exam in your Second-Year."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "As for the Golden Jade Wall, think of it as Old Gao's congratulatory gift for passing the Artifact Refinement exam."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Does Director Gao even know he's celebrating my exam success?"

Zhang Yu replied, "Thank you, Teacher."

He quickly downloaded the Treasure Appraisal Manual and stored it in his Bionic Eye.

While browsing, he noticed the Chain Method Diagram Set associated with the Treasure Appraisal Manual: Artifact Refinement Prodigy.

Zhang Yu mused, "Unlike the various Artifact Refinement Techniques, this Treasure Appraisal Manual, as a cultivation art, can actually trigger a Chain Formation Diagram."

Zhang Yu understood that the path of Artifact Refinement involved more than just mastering the techniques for crafting magical artifacts and Bionics. Many cultivation arts could also enhance one's related abilities in this field.

The Treasure Appraisal Manual before him was just one example. Other Daoist Cultivation Arts included the Five Thunder Refinement Urgency Method, the Red Dust Weapon Refinement Art, and the Dragon Vein Artifact Forging Manual.

However, these cultivation arts differed fundamentally from most of those Zhang Yu had previously practiced. They all belonged to the category of Daoist Cultivation Arts.

The defining characteristic of Daoist Cultivation Arts was their exorbitant cost. Not only was the right to use them expensive, but the resources required for cultivation far exceeded those of martial dao techniques.

Until now, Zhang Yu's cultivation arts had been either pure mental cultivation techniques, breathing techniques, or martial dao techniques. This was the first time he had qualified to practice a Daoist Cultivation Art like the Treasure Appraisal Manual.

The primary reason for this was the prohibitive cost of Daoist Cultivation Arts.

"Cultivating Daoist Arts often requires special materials, such as various types of Thunderfire, unique substances like Red Dust Qi or Heavenly Gang Qi, or specific environments like Dragon Veins or Yin Caves."

"Some Daoist Arts consume vast amounts of spiritual energy and require purchasing special Magic Power types that one doesn't naturally possess."

"If the art involves artifact refinement, it often necessitates the use of various magical artifacts to aid in cultivation..."

Zhang Yu sighed inwardly. This was precisely why he hadn't chosen to cultivate artifact refinement techniques when he embarked on the path of artifact crafting.

After all, the production techniques for various magical artifacts alone already placed a tremendous financial strain on Zhang Yu. He simply couldn't afford to invest in artifact refinement techniques.

Zhang Yu's original plan was to wait until his artifact crafting skill reached a certain level, allowing him to break even, before considering artifact refinement techniques.

"This is likely why the first three years of the Artifact Refinement Department's curriculum don't require artifact refinement techniques."

"Trying to pursue both paths simultaneously would create unbearable financial pressure. Most students in the Artifact Refinement Department probably couldn't handle it."

As Zhang Yu gazed at the Treasure Appraisal Manual before him, his delight grew. With the usage rights granted by True Monarch Magnetic Pole, he could truly save a significant amount of money.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Are you still determined to keep our relationship a secret? Won't you come study in the Artifact Refinement Department?"

Zhang Yu: I'm sorry, True Monarch. Director Gao has been very good to me, and I don't want to hurt him.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "After the final exams, I'll have mastered three of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering."

"I've already asked Director Gao about the upcoming Civil Engineering Competition. The top seven winners will still be awarded two slots for the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering."

"If I secure another slot, I'll have mastered four of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering."

"Once I pass the Military Certificate exam, I just need to pass three of the seven Civil Engineering Techniques tests and obtain three Seven Absolutes..."

At this thought, Zhang Yu seemed to already see the military-grade martial dao technique, Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, beckoning him.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "While I can continue to guide you in artifact refinement and even secretly grant you a degree from the Artifact Refinement Department..."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "...if you don't publicly join the Artifact Refinement Department, you'll never have the chance to master its true esoteric arts."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "For example, our department's two military-grade cultivation techniques: Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon and Grand Void Divine Artifact Strategy."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "And the military-grade Bionics and magical artifacts like Heavenly Sun Radiance God, Void Calamity Transformation Diagram, Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation, and more — you'll never have the opportunity to learn or handle them."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Your senior sister Ye Xingli has already cultivated the Grand Void Divine Artifact Strategy and is about to complete the refining of the Void Calamity Transformation Diagram."

Lady Fortune commented, "The Artifact Refinement Department is clearly superior to the Civil Engineering Department. They have far more military-grade Power."

A thought struck Zhang Yu: "This True Monarch Magnetic Pole... is she trying to tempt me with all this?"

Yet he couldn't deny that hearing her words stirred something within him. It would be impossible to remain completely unmoved.

Even if he were to study military-grade Power in the Artifact Refinement Department, Zhang Yu still wanted to master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power in the Civil Engineering Department first. After all, he was already nearly halfway there.

Lady Fortune chuckled. "True Monarch Magnetic Pole initially offered you a chance to become her disciple out of convenience."

"But after last year's Civil Engineering Competition, she recognized your innate physical talent and offered you a secret apprenticeship."

"Now that she's seen your aptitude for artifact refinement, she likely believes you have a high chance of mastering the Artifact Refinement Department's military-grade Power. That's why she wants to publicly acknowledge your relationship in the future."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly, thinking to himself that he had indeed gradually sensed a shift in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's attitude toward him during their interactions.

Lady Fortune continued, "She's definitely trying to tempt you now. Even if you truly want to transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department, it won't happen overnight. You have plenty of time to master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. There's no need to prematurely reveal your connection and risk Director Gao's disapproval."

"True Monarch Magnetic Pole must know this too. I suspect she's just dangling a carrot to solidify your resolve to publicly acknowledge your relationship in the future."

Zhang Yu: "I need to think about it."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Take your time."
