# Chapter 778: Enemy, Teacher, Heavenly Sword, Immortal Sect Review

As Lady Fortune listened to Zhang Yu and Immortal Slayer discuss High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts, her gaze flickered. She immediately realized the implications: a fierce competition for spiritual energy was inevitable.

"There are plenty of fields that will compete with High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts for spiritual energy!" she thought to herself.

Just as she was about to voice this, Immortal Slayer spoke first. "Given how much spiritual energy these High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts consume, other Dao Lineages won't just stand by. After all, they aren't the only ones who need spiritual energy. Dharma Realms, Dharma Drugs, Soul Cultivators... they'll all be competing for it."

Lady Fortune quickly added, "I—I was just about to say the same thing!"

"Mm," Zhang Yu acknowledged.

Lady Fortune cursed herself inwardly, frustrated that Immortal Slayer had stolen her thunder. "I really was going to say that! Damn this slow tongue of mine! I need to speak faster next time!"

Meanwhile, Gu Qingya continued, "In short, the Innate Dao Lineage has deep roots, and the forces behind Lu Hengzhang are formidable. Unless he makes a grave mistake himself, even if I become Minister, I won't be able to touch him easily."

"So, Zhang Yu, remember this: if you want to climb the sect's hierarchy, you must first learn to endure."

"Bide your time, build your strength, and wait for the right moment."

Zhang Yu looked at Gu Qingya and nodded slightly, acknowledging the truth in his words.

Gu Qingya smiled mysteriously. "If you run into any difficulties, you can come find me after work. I can offer you some personal guidance."

Zhang Yu nodded in thanks, then thought to himself, "For the next year, I'll have to quietly build my strength. After all, I won't officially become a Group Leader and reach the 3rd Rank until then. Even if Lu Hengzhang's position becomes vacant within this year, it won't be my turn..."

Immortal Slayer agreed. "First, accumulate power and wait patiently for an opportunity. High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts are developing rapidly, but many factions are dissatisfied. When they start fighting among themselves like the crane and the clam, our chance for promotion will naturally arise."

"But be wary of Lu Hengzhang. As a supporter of the Innate Dao Lineage, he will never stop trying to suppress you. If we want to advance in the future, he, as our direct superior, will undoubtedly be a major threat."

<hr />

"Zhang Yu... that bastard. I want to eliminate him as soon as possible."

Meanwhile, Lu Hengzhang thought to himself, "Now that this brat has become the Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One, he's a thorn in my side, a fishbone stuck in my throat."

Although Lu Hengzhang had barely spoken to Zhang Yu since the latter joined the sect, he knew they were already enemies.

What Lu Hengzhang hadn't expected was that this minor cultivator from the Lower Realm, someone he thought he could easily suppress, would seize every opportunity to climb the ranks. In the blink of an eye, Zhang Yu had become an Acting Group Leader and was set to reach the 3rd Rank in just one year.

Lu Hengzhang understood that once Zhang Yu became an Official Group Leader and reached the 3rd Rank, their relationship would become far more delicate.

"If Zhang Yu posed no threat to me before," Lu Hengzhang thought, "then as an Official Group Leader, he will become a minor threat."

Opportunities for subordinates to overthrow their superiors were rare, but even a minor threat was something Lu Hengzhang refused to tolerate. His preferred method was to crush all threats before they could grow.

Lu Hengzhang's voice crossed the Dharma Realm, slowly reaching the other side. "Vice Pavilion Master Yang, within this year... I want to find a way to knock Zhang Yu down so he can't become an Official Group Leader."

The person Lu Hengzhang was contacting was Vice Pavilion Master Yang of the Edict Pavilion.

Within the Myriad Laws Sect, the hierarchy of ranks and positions was strictly enforced, and titles were used with absolute precision.

For instance, when addressing his superior now, Lu Hengzhang wouldn't vaguely call him "Pavilion Master" but would precisely use the title "Vice Pavilion Master."

Of course, before this Void Refinement Dao Lord, who was two full ranks above him and had already established his own Dharma Laws, Lu Hengzhang appeared extremely deferential.

Even though the other party hadn't projected an image, Lu Hengzhang instinctively lowered his head and bowed, as if listening to his guidance. His subservience to this leader had become second nature.

Vice Pavilion Master Yang's voice echoed back: "Suppressing a Lower Realm cultivator is a matter of course."

"However, Gu Qingya will soon take over as Minister of the Review Department. Avoid conflict with them for now."

"Our main focus must remain on High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts. We need to push the relevant technologies through review and into the market as quickly as possible."

Lu Hengzhang nodded. He knew that compared to artifact refinement and Daoist arts, the martial Dao was never the sect's top priority.

High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts, in particular, had nothing to do with the martial Dao.

Lu Hengzhang understood that if it weren't for the need to stop Luo Wuji from establishing his Dharma Laws and prevent his faction from further sealing away black arts, with subtle support from other factions, he and his backers wouldn't be acting so aggressively.

Despite knowing that the higher-ups intended to focus their efforts on promoting High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts, Lu Hengzhang couldn't help but feel resentful. "Are we really just going to let Zhang Yu, a mere Lower Realm cultivator, run free? His talent and background are likely extraordinary. If we let him continue unchecked..."

Vice Pavilion Master Yang interrupted, "He's just a Nascent Soul. What trouble could he cause in a year or two?"

"Besides, an opportunity will arise for you. In three months at the earliest, a year at the latest."

"Act then..."

<hr />

Over the next few days, Zhang Yu familiarized himself with the personnel and operations of Martial Dao Group One, as well as his duties as Group Leader.

Several days passed in the blink of an eye.

Inside a training school on the Kunxu Eleventh Layer.

Several Soul Transformation cultivators, part of a contracted training program, were recounting their recent mission experiences working under Void Refinement Upper Cultivators.

The Void Refinement Realm was a state Lower Realm Soul Transformation cultivators eternally craved but could never reach.

The more unattainable it seemed, the more curious and fascinated they became by its every detail and power.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole listened silently from the side, a pang of regret rising in her heart. "Void Refinement... I'll never reach it in this lifetime."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole understood her situation perfectly. As a leader of the Ten Universities in the Lower Realm, she held unrivaled authority there. But in the eyes of the sect's Upper Cultivators, she was nothing more than a tool for governing the Lower Realm.

"For the sect, a tool at the Soul Transformation Realm is sufficient."

"They won't give us the chance to reach a higher realm, nor will they ever permit us to break through..."

At this thought, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed inwardly. "Besides, breaking through to Void Refinement requires reaching the Kunxu Fifteenth Layer. What chance do we have?"

A lifetime of struggle, a lifetime of effort on the Path of the Immortal Dao, all brought to an abrupt halt at the Soul Transformation Realm, forcefully severed by others.

Only they, the Soul Transformation cultivators like Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, knew the bitter frustration that festered in their hearts.

"On the other hand, these contracted Soul Transformation experts from the Ninth and Tenth Layers have a slightly better chance than we do."

Watching the other Soul Transformation cultivators still excitedly discussing "Void Refinement," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole thought, "Although I've heard that the chances of a contractor becoming a full sect member are almost nonexistent these days, at least there's still a sliver of possibility."

"In contrast, we leaders of the Ten Universities... our only hope of joining the sect is probably to reincarnate and pass the Sect Examination in our next life."

As Magnetic Pole sighed inwardly, Divine Monarch Greenwood patted her shoulder comfortingly. He knew his old friend was feeling bitter again.

Just then, a contracted Soul Transformation expert suddenly spoke up. "Magnetic Pole, didn't you say your disciple passed the Sect Staff examination? By now, they should have been in the sect for several months. How come you haven't even seen them?"

Another Soul Transformation expert from the Tenth Layer chuckled. "Magnetic Pole, given your position, you probably don't understand the sect well enough. Once your disciple entered the sect, they likely disowned you as their master long ago."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole snorted coldly. "My disciple just joined the sect and is extremely busy. I told them not to come see me."

The contracted Soul Transformation experts exchanged knowing smiles, clearly not believing a word she said.

They had dealt with sect disciples before and understood their attitudes all too well.

Even with their Soul Transformation cultivation, they were practically invisible to most sect cultivators, treated as mere tools.

If it weren't for the various benefits within the Sect Layer, the chance to earn Immortal Coins for sect-exclusive resources, and that faint, illusory hope of becoming full sect members, they would never endure the humiliation of serving here.

A contracted Soul Transformation expert sneered in a small group chat. "Sect Staff have to finish their daily tasks within four hours. Besides, her disciple is just a Level 1 Sect Staff. How busy could they possibly be?"

Another person in the group chat added, "Haha, they've probably already cut ties. Even a Level 1 Sect Staff is a Sect Scion. Why would they bother with an old Soul Transformation expert from the Fifth Layer?"

Just then, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's vision flashed. A friend request from the Dharma Realm had arrived.

Dharma Realm friend requests always displayed the rank first, then the position, and finally the individual's name.

When she saw "Level 2 Sect Staff" and the title "Acting Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One, Edict Pavilion Review Department," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's thoughts froze.

As her mind raced, wondering why a Level 2 Sect Staff would add her as a friend, the final two characters "Zhang Yu" explained everything.

A moment later, Magnetic Pole cleared her throat and announced loudly to Greenwood, Nether Spring, Sinful Lotus, and the others, "Zhang Yu is projecting over to visit us."

The Soul Transformation experts from the Ten Universities immediately turned to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole in astonishment.

The next moment, a flash of light appeared, and Zhang Yu's figure materialized before them.

When Divine Monarch Greenwood, Divine Monarch Nether Spring, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, and the others saw "Level 2 Sect Staff" displayed above Zhang Yu's head, they were all stunned.

Divine Monarch Nether Spring thought to herself, "Zhang Yu got promoted? So quickly?"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus was equally astonished. "He joined the sect only a few months ago, right? How did he already reach the 2nd Rank?"

Meanwhile, the contracted Soul Transformation experts reacted even faster. The instant Zhang Yu appeared, their gazes locked onto him, their minds racing as a torrent of information surged between them.

While the Ten Universities Soul Transformation Experts focused on the "Level 2 Sect Staff" title, the contracted experts were more interested in the other part of Zhang Yu's display: "Acting Group Leader of Martial Dao Group One, Edict Pavilion Review Department."

The small group chat immediately erupted with messages about this position.

"Shouldn't a Group Leader in the Edict Pavilion Review Department be 3rd Rank? Why does it say 2nd?"

"Didn't you see it says 'Acting Group Leader'? He'll officially be promoted to the 3rd Rank when he becomes the official Group Leader next year."

"Hiss..." Someone more familiar with the Myriad Laws Sect's rules gasped in the small group chat. "He must have timed his promotion to Level 2 with the March evaluation after joining, then became an Acting Group Leader. Now he's set to time his promotion to the 3rd Rank with next year's evaluation."

"That's a battlefield promotion! A triple jump!"

"Could he really be Magnetic Pole's disciple? She must be a proxy master, taking in a disciple for some big shot who can't openly acknowledge him. His real master definitely isn't her..."

In that moment, Zhang Yu became unfathomably profound in the eyes of the contracted Soul Transformation experts present.

They quickly stood up and greeted him in unison, "Group Leader Zhang..."

Witnessing this perfectly synchronized display, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, Divine Monarch Nether Spring, and the others were surprised. They then realized that Zhang Yu's status as a Level 2 Sect Staff was far more significant than they had initially estimated.

Zhang Yu gave a slight nod to the contracted experts before turning to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood. "Teachers, it's been a long time."

"Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, Divine Monarch Nether Spring... greetings."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, Divine Monarch Nether Spring, and the others responded one by one. Unconsciously, they found themselves, esteemed Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, feeling a hint of restraint in the presence of Zhang Yu, a mere Nascent Soul True Monarch.

Just then, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole spoke up. "Now that you're an Acting Group Leader, you must be incredibly busy. What are you doing here? You've finally joined the sect; you should prioritize your work."

Zhang Yu smiled faintly. In truth, he had wanted to contact Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood for some time, but one matter after another had kept him occupied. Only now did he have a moment to spare, so he had asked True Monarch Starfire to help him locate them.

Hearing Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's words, Zhang Yu replied, "It's alright, Teacher. I'm working at the same time."

Under the enthusiastic questioning of the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, Zhang Yu briefly recounted his recent experiences, including his work and promotions.

The Ten Universities' Soul Transformation Experts finally understood that Zhang Yu, as an Acting Group Leader, was set to be promoted to the Third Rank in a year, which surprised them even more.

"Excellent," Divine Monarch Greenwood said, looking at Zhang Yu with emotion. "Looking back, I never could have imagined you would achieve so much."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole remained silent, sighing inwardly. "Although I have no hope of reaching Void Refinement in this lifetime... one day... my disciple might be able to break through to the Void Refinement Realm."

Watching his two teachers, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "If I get the chance in the future, perhaps I can bring both Teachers to the Sect Layer to help me."

Immortal Slayer agreed. "Indeed. You and these two teachers have been through life and death together. The trust between you is incredibly rare in Kunxu. In the future, you might find subordinates in the Sect Layer who are stronger than they are now, but it will be difficult to find companions like them... whom you can trust completely."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly. "Trust... is too much of a luxury in Kunxu."

Immortal Slayer continued, "Besides trust, Magnetic Pole and Greenwood also possess considerable abilities. Especially Magnetic Pole, her Dao Seed, the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology has been a great help to us in the past and holds immense potential for the future."

After speaking with his two Masters, Zhang Yu chatted with Divine Monarch Nether Spring about Wang Yin. He relayed the message Wang Yin had asked him to deliver and told Nether Spring that if she had any reply, she could let him know, and he would have someone deliver it down to Wang Yin before the next Sect Examination.

After adding the Soul Transformation experts from the Ten Universities as friends and exchanging a few more words, Zhang Yu's projection dissipated, severing the connection.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole looked helpless and said slowly, "That boy... slacking off during work hours just to visit us? Sigh, I'll send him a message later and tell him not to waste time like this in the future."

"She's showing off again!" Divine Monarch Nether Spring cursed inwardly. She then thought of the message from Wang Yin asking for money.

Although she was somewhat pleased that her son was becoming more adept at leeching off his parents, comparing him to someone else's disciple still left a bitter taste in her mouth.

"I should have just taken Zhang Yu as my disciple back then. He could have been Wang Yin's 'dad' and looked after him."

The other Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs nearby also wore thoughtful expressions.

In their minds, the path of the Immortal Dao had long since changed.

In the current Kunxu Immortal Dao, one only needed to consider oneself. Masters and disciples were merely tools to advance one's own immortal path.

But after witnessing the relationship between Zhang Yu, Magnetic Pole, and Greenwood several times, their perspectives began to shift unconsciously. It was as if they had returned to a distant past, to the days when respecting one's master and valuing the Dao were paramount.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus thought to herself, "This kind of master-disciple bond... perhaps it's worth investing in."

Just then, a Soul Transformation expert who had been teasing Magnetic Pole and explaining the sect's rules walked over, smiling. "Magnetic Pole, you've taken on a fine disciple! He's only been in the sect for a few months and has already reached Level 2 Sect Staff. His future is limitless!"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "What's so great about being a Level 2 Sect Staff? I heard him say it's high pressure, heavy responsibility, and exhausting work. One slip-up and you're drowning in overtime. The competition is fierce, full of backstabbing and scheming. It's much simpler for you contracted experts, just keep your heads down and work. You don't have to worry about all the things Sect Staff do."

The other expert's face stiffened, but he could only manage an awkward laugh.

<hr />

Inside Heavenly Sword Sect.

Bai Zhenzhen gazed at Zhang Yu's 2nd Rank insignia, a competitive fire igniting within her. "I can't fall too far behind Yu Zi!"

The Sect Examination Clone roared in her mind, "If you want to catch up, you must follow my instructions! Start by learning the Sect Devotee Realm with me!"

Bai Zhenzhen ignored the clone, her thoughts drifting back to when she first arrived at the Heavenly Sword Sect.

Back then, a fellow sect disciple, also from Heavenly Sword University, had explained the sect's current technological landscape to her and Wen Wuya.

"With the rapid advancement of Immortal Dao Technology, the spiritual control of matter, the construction of the Sentient Heaven and Earth within the Heavenly Sword Sect is now well underway..."

"Using the Sect Devotee Sword Intent as the foundation and supplementing it with other emotion-based Sword Intents, we can drive a magnificent Sword Dao Technology that surpasses all past and present achievements, ranking first among the Ten Sects."

"However, different emotions come with vastly different cultivation costs, risks, and difficulties..."

The disciple looked at Bai Zhenzhen and Wen Wuya seriously. "Shock, Shame, Fear... these Sword Intents are relatively safe and more suitable for you."

Wen Wuya asked in astonishment, "Even shock works?"

The disciple smiled. "Of course. Your current state is perfect for it. Having just ascended from the Lower Realm, you're ideally suited to cultivate the Shock Sword."

"In contrast, emotions like Anger, Sorrow, Pain, Disgust, Lust, and Hatred are much riskier."

"Sorrow and Pain, if too intense, can drive a person insane or lead to suicidal tendencies. Anger, Disgust, and Hatred are the primary causes of sword assault cases."

The disciple declared proudly, "That's why our Heavenly Sword Sect has the highest number of Homicide Permit holders among the Ten Sects."

"As for Lust..."

The disciple continued, "With the growing number of cultivators practicing the Lust Sword, our Heavenly Sword Sect's Compulsory Dual Cultivation statistics have reached an all-time high."

He beamed with pride. "In a few more years, we'll likely surpass the Celestial Monster Sect to become the number one sect for Compulsory Dual Cultivation."

Hearing this, the Sect Examination Clone roared in Bai Zhenzhen's mind, "Our Heavenly Sword Sect is the greatest in the world! In the future, all our statistics will surely claim the top spot among the Ten Sects!"

Hearing this, Wen Wuya's heart sank, and a chill ran through her. "This Heavenly Sword Sect is fraught with danger," she thought. "It's far, far more perilous than the Lower Realm."

Seeing her expression, the disciple remarked, "That state isn't bad either. It's suitable for the Fear Sword."

Bai Zhenzhen frowned. "Are there any other options?"

"Of course," the disciple replied. "There's also our sect's current number one Sword Dao school: the Bliss Sword Dao."

Bai Zhenzhen's gaze sharpened. "Bliss?"

"It's simpler than Shock, Fear, or Shame," the disciple explained, "and safer than Anger, Sorrow, Pain, Disgust, Lust, or Hatred."

"It's simply happiness."

"Forge the Supreme Sword Dao with Supreme Bliss."

Wen Wuya was stunned. "This Sword Dao... does it mean... you can grow stronger just by being happy? Unleash Sword Intent? Reshape the world?"

The disciple nodded. "You've got it."

Bai Zhenzhen pressed further, "Then... what's the drawback? If people are still choosing other paths, the Bliss Sword Dao must have a major flaw, right?"

The disciple shook their head. "It's not exactly a major flaw in the technique itself. It's just that the cultivation requirements for the Bliss Sword Dao are too high."

"Because happiness... is expensive."

"The more money you have, the happier you can be."

"And as you advance in the Bliss Sword Dao, your need for happiness grows ever higher and harder to satisfy, requiring even more money to progress."

Just then, a wave of gasps erupted from the surroundings. "Holy shit! Lower Realm Natives!"

"Huh? They really are Lower Realm Natives!"

"Unbelievable! How did Lower Realm Natives get up here?!"

"Damn, they're Lower Realm Natives who actually passed the sect's entrance exam!"

Hearing the growing chorus of shock, the cultivator who had been explaining the technical landscape to Bai Zhenzhen and Wen Wuya immediately grabbed them and started running.

"Hurry! The Shock Sword cultivators are gathering! Don't let them swarm us, or we'll never get away!"

<hr />

Myriad Laws Sect, inside the Edict Pavilion.

After rejoining the Martial Dao Group, Zhang Yu dedicated a portion of his time each day to practicing the foundational martial arts of the Nascent Soul Sacred Body.

In the blink of an eye, over a month passed. He had advanced the Nascent Soul Sacred Body to its peak (16/16), enhancing its effects by another 20%.

With the arrival of his new monthly salary and bonuses from Qu Yizhi, Chu Wangji, and others, Zhang Yu's savings soared past 10,000 Immortal Coins, and his Dao Merit reached 120.

Gazing at the Immortal Coins in his account, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "At this rate, I'll be able to exchange for an Immortal Spiritual Root in just a few months. That'll solve one major problem."

In the following days, Zhang Yu continued to work, advance his Nascent Soul Sacred Body, and diligently save money, steadily building his Immortal Dao foundation.

Time flew by, and seven months passed in an instant.

Then, a piece of news struck the Edict Pavilion like a thunderclap.

A newly created Immortal Sect Technique was about to be submitted to the pavilion for review.
