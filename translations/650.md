# Chapter 650: Choosing a Cultivation Art, The Principal's Transmission of Power

Hearing Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's question, Zhang Yu replied without hesitation, "I'll choose whatever cultivation art the school recommends."

The Divine Monarch smiled. "The Immortal Sect Technique I want you to choose is called the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm. Have you heard of it?"

"No," Zhang Yu shook his head. "But since it's the Divine Monarch's choice, this art must be infinitely profound, capable of benefiting all living beings in Kunxu and propelling the Immortal Dao to unprecedented prosperity."

The Divine Monarch nodded. "You've hit the nail on the head."

"The Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm is a cultivation art for constructing the Dharma Realm."

"The Dharma Realm is an evolved and enhanced version of the Spirit Realm, far more practical and efficient."

"For example, the Spirit Realm primarily transmits information and, at most, some divine power."

"But the upgraded Dharma Realm... can not only transmit these, but also effortlessly transmit Magic Power, Gang Qi, vital energy, spiritual energy, Primordial Qi, memories, lifespan, and more. Resource allocation efficiency will be countless times greater than the Spirit Realm's, and the operational costs of society will be reduced to near zero."

At this point, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution couldn't help but sigh, "With the Dharma Realm, everyone's cultivation progress will advance by leaps and bounds, and the development speed of Immortal Dao Technology will far surpass anything we've seen before."

"In the Dharma Realm, no one will need to worry about employment or material concerns. Everyone can simply cultivate according to their interests and desires, living fulfilling and happy lives."

"This is the world the Dharma Realm will create, and the reason we chose the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm."

"However, just as with the initial promotion of the Spirit Realm, some harbor reservations, misunderstandings, and even fear toward the Dharma Realm. They worry about the growing pains that will accompany advancements in Immortal Dao Technology, making it difficult to reach a consensus."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution turned to Zhang Yu, his gaze filled with admiration. "But Zhang Yu, if you can seize the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm, study its Dharma Realm Technology, and upgrade and transform the Spirit Realm, you will become the founding father of the Dharma Realm within the University Realm. You will wield unparalleled authority in the upgraded Dharma Realm."

"At that point, achieving Soul Transformation will be as easy as flipping your hand. The realms you can reach in the future will be limitless..."

As Zhang Yu listened to Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's explanation, his anxiety grew with each word.

The topic was simply too vast, and the stakes involved were far too high.

Especially the Dharma Realm's capabilities — after hearing only a few sentences, Zhang Yu sensed an unfathomable depth within it.

At that moment, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution flicked his finger, and a contract materialized before Zhang Yu.

"This contract stipulates that if you win the championship, you must choose the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm from the Immortal Sect Techniques."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution smiled faintly. "Student Yu, I hope you understand that this isn't about distrusting you. It's merely school policy. Signing this contract allows the school to better support you — it's standard procedure."

"Moreover, this contract also serves as protection for you."

"By signing it, you can dispel the malicious intentions many harbor toward you."

Zhang Yu examined the contract carefully but hesitated to sign.

He had always harbored a deep distrust of contracts. Furthermore, his understanding of the Dharma Realm remained superficial, and signing such an agreement without a deeper understanding felt unsettling.

Zhang Yu's gaze flickered, and he suddenly said, "Principal, I have something I need to ask you about."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: "What is it?"

Zhang Yu organized his thoughts before speaking slowly, "For the upcoming final battle against Kuang Tianqing, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions and Bai Zhenzhen of Heavenly Sword University are willing to lend me the sword formed from Bai Zhenzhen's physical body."

"With this sword's assistance, my chances of victory would greatly improve."

"However, I'm unsure if they might have any conditions, such as requirements regarding the choice of Immortal Sect Techniques."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution remained silent, staring at Zhang Yu for a long moment. The intensity of his gaze sent chills down Zhang Yu's spine, and the surrounding air seemed to freeze. Finally, the Divine Monarch chuckled softly.

"Interesting."

"Are you negotiating with me?"

Zhang Yu: "I wouldn't dare."

"Oh, but you very much dare," Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution said, his eyes gleaming with amusement. "On the path of the Immortal Dao, daring to negotiate, daring to fight for one's own interests... these are virtues."

"Many students and cultivators, upon seeing Myriad Laws University and me, would sign contracts without hesitation, forfeiting significant benefits."

"Your willingness to negotiate with me demonstrates your ambition and potential to ascend the Immortal Dao."

With a sigh, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution said, "Seven Emotions, come forth. I concede this wager. I didn't expect this young man to have such courage."

A flash of light appeared behind Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution, and Divine Monarch Seven Emotions stepped forward, turning to Zhang Yu. "Zhang Yu, if I offered you the chance to choose another Immortal Sect Technique, would you accept?"

As Zhang Yu hesitated, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions continued, "The Extreme Emotion Sword Dao was created by the Extreme Emotion Immortal of the Heavenly Sword Sect. However, the current lineage is incomplete."

"If we could obtain another Immortal Sect sword technique from the Extreme Emotion Immortal's legacy, we could complete the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao. Bai Zhenzhen's cultivation would then be flawless, free from her erratic behavior."

"She would no longer self-destruct her physical body or transform her body into a sword, as she did during her battle with Kuang Tianqing."

"The Immortal Sect Technique I want you to choose is precisely that sword technique from the Extreme Emotion Immortal's legacy."

At this point, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions paused slightly before adding, "Of course, this sword technique isn't just beneficial for Zhenzhen and me. For you, it will be the greatest opportunity of your life."

"By comprehending the Immortal Dao Technology of using spiritual energy to manipulate matter, you could become the wealthiest person in the University Realm."

"Especially as the technology spreads, the Kunxu below the tenth layer will transform into a world of emotions, where everyone can reshape reality through love, affection, and righteousness. You will become the leader of this entire industry..."

Hearing these words, Zhang Yu felt a growing sense of unease.

"A world of emotions? Who knows what kind of world the Kunxu People's emotions might create?"

Simultaneously, feeling the gazes of the two Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs and sensing the two choices laid before him, Zhang Yu suddenly felt as if his body weighed a thousand pounds. Under the pressure exerted by the two Soul Transformation experts, he found it equally difficult to choose either option.

But then, the image of Bai Zhenzhen flashed through his mind — the vision of her transforming into a sword to fight alongside him. In that instant, Zhang Yu seemed to have made his decision.

"I..."

Just then, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution chuckled. "No need to rush. Zhang Yu hasn't even won the championship yet. What's the point of arguing over the Immortal Sect Technique now?"

"Let's help Zhang Yu secure the victory first. We can discuss the Immortal Sect Technique at our leisure afterward."

Sensing the sudden dissipation of pressure and the easing of the atmosphere, Zhang Yu breathed a sigh of relief.

"Divine Monarch Seven Emotions..." he thought to himself. "The moment she agreed to lend A-Zhen to me for the final battle, she must have already anticipated the issue of the Immortal Sect Technique. That's why she negotiated with Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution beforehand, leading to this current situation."

"A-Zhen, thank you. If not for you, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions would have intervened, and I'd likely have been forced to sign a contract by Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution, rather than achieving a balance between Heavenly Sword and Myriad Laws."

"This balance grants me temporary autonomy, preventing me from becoming a mere puppet."

At the same moment, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' figure gradually faded away, leaving only her voice echoing in Zhang Yu's ears.

"Very well. We'll wait until Zhang Yu secures the championship, then our two universities will jointly discuss the Immortal Sect Technique."

"For the next week, you will train Zhang Yu."

"Before the final battle, I will send Zhenzhen to join you. Together, you will face Kuang Tianqing."

As Divine Monarch Seven Emotions vanished, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution continued, "Over the next seven days, you must further enhance your combat prowess to stand a chance against Kuang Tianqing."

"Do you know what the biggest gap between you and Kuang Tianqing currently is?"

Zhang Yu pondered for a moment before solemnly replying, "She has mastered one more Dao than I have."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution nodded slightly. "Correct. It seems you have a deep understanding of this."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's breathing involuntarily quickened. "Is it finally time?" he thought to himself.

"The one Dao Kuang Tianqing has mastered that I haven't... that must be dual cultivation."

"So, is the principal going to train me in dual cultivation techniques now?"

"Will he have senior sisters from various departments assist me? What kind of arduous and terrifying dual cultivation training will it be?"

Just as Zhang Yu was lost in thought, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution said, "The missing piece of the puzzle between you and Kuang Tianqing is Core Shattering."

"Core Shattering?!" Zhang Yu's face paled instantly, his heart sinking. "No! Does this mean I'll have to become a woman like Kuang Tianqing?!"

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution lightly tapped his fingertip, and projections of Golden Cores materialized before Zhang Yu.

"The Golden Core Certificate has its limits," the Divine Monarch explained. "Even among the Ten Greats, not every Foundation Establishment cultivator can break through to the Golden Core Realm."

"Therefore, cultivators stuck at the peak of Foundation Establishment constantly seek ways to further enhance themselves."

"Core Shattering Techniques are among the most effective methods."

"The principle is simple: charge toward the Golden Core Realm, and just before fully entering it, deliberately shatter your own Golden Core. The explosive force from the shattered core then propels you forward."

"As Core Shattering Techniques evolved, specialized Golden Cores were developed — ones that prioritize shattering power over realm advancement."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution swept his finger across the projections. "These specialized Core Shattering Golden Cores cost at least several hundred Spirit Coins each. I've arranged for the school to sell them to you for just ten Spirit Coins apiece."

He then sent Zhang Yu a document. "I'm also giving you the Heavenly Meteor Core Shattering Scripture."

"Your task for the next seven days is to cultivate this technique as deeply as possible."

"Remember, this is currently your best chance to close the gap with Kuang Tianqing. Pour all your energy and focus into it."
