# Chapter 759: The Immortal Spiritual Root is Gone? Day of Departure

As Zhang Yu repeatedly circulated his cultivation art, he could feel the True Spirit Root within him unfurling further.

Like an Azure Lotus on the verge of blooming, it gradually expanded and extended, absorbing each cultivation art Zhang Yu channeled as if it were nourishment, fueling the lotus's continued blossoming.

Just as the tenth Level 40 cultivation art was about to be completely absorbed, Zhang Yu seemed to sense something. He abruptly clasped his hands together, activating the Level 40 Strategic Immortal Sect Technique, Kunlun in the Palm.

In that instant, all light, sound, and spiritual energy within the room were sucked into the Immortal Space held in Zhang Yu's palms.

With Zhang Yu at its center, the entire space collapsed into pure darkness, swallowing everything like a black hole.

Yet, within this absolute void, faint wisps of azure light emerged, like tender sprouts breaking through solid rock, slowly stretching out from the black abyss.

Accompanied by the warping of space, these azure strands were gradually drawn into threads of light, eventually coalescing into the form of an Azure Lotus.

Watching this scene unfold, Zhang Yu simultaneously sensed the changes within his Spiritual Root. He thought to himself, "It really is... an Immortal Spiritual Root."

"And what a commotion it's causing. If I hadn't used Kunlun in the Palm with all my strength to conceal it, the radiance from the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo's ascension would have likely illuminated the entire sky."

In Zhang Yu's perception, the azure brilliance radiating from the Immortal Spiritual Root seemed to be... gradually adapting to his Kunlun in the Palm, as if trying to break free from his restraint.

A thought stirred in Zhang Yu's mind: "It wants to... return? To complete its overall ascension."

With this realization, Zhang Yu embraced Bai Zhenzhen from behind and whispered in her ear, "A-Zhen, it's coming! Catch it!"

The next moment, Bai Zhenzhen felt the Spiritual Root surge violently into her Dantian in her lower abdomen, returning to her body.

But the once-familiar True Spirit Root had now undergone a drastic transformation.

If the original True Spirit Root, after numerous upgrades, had gradually come to resemble an Azure Lotus composed of countless nerve-like tendrils, the current True Spirit Root seemed to have dissolved into streams of light particles. These particles permeated every inch of Bai Zhenzhen's flesh and blood, finally coalescing in her Dantian into an Azure Lotus that pulsed with a faint halo of light.

In that instant, Bai Zhenzhen could feel that the Spiritual Root had not only connected with her flesh and blood but had also become an entity both real and illusory, deeply rooted within her Nascent Soul and Sea of Consciousness.

Thanks to this profound integration, the Spiritual Root's adaptability skyrocketed once more. No matter what changes her physical body, Nascent Soul, or Sea of Consciousness underwent, the Immortal Spiritual Root would now adapt perfectly.

Furthermore, Bai Zhenzhen noticed that this ethereal True Spirit Root within her possessed even greater concealment abilities.

With a single thought, the Spiritual Root, condensed from streams of brilliance, flickered gently and dissolved into a halo of light, vanishing within her body.

Bai Zhenzhen knew this meant the True Spirit Root had completely disintegrated and hidden itself within her flesh and blood. At this moment, no matter how she was examined, she would appear to have no Spiritual Root at all.

Of course, in this state of complete dissolution and concealment, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't utilize any of the True Spirit Root's effects.

While Bai Zhenzhen was experiencing the power of her upgraded True Spirit Root, Zhang Yu was simultaneously assessing the new effects of his 4th-tier Azure Lotus Sword Embryo.

The Feather Spirit Root also transformed into an Azure Lotus of light, blooming within Zhang Yu's lower abdomen.

As he gazed at the Dao Seed Register and felt the changes in his Feather Spirit Root, he thought to himself, "After evolving into an Immortal Spiritual Root, all its basic abilities have surged, but... in terms of evolutionary direction, A-Zhen and I have diverged even further."

Zhang Yu could sense that after evolving into an Immortal Spiritual Root, his Feather Spirit Root's adaptation was now leaning more heavily toward the Chain Formation Diagram.

"If equipping a Chain Formation Diagram set for a month previously allowed the Feather Spirit Root to adapt to about 1% of its effects, retaining that 1% even after switching diagrams, then now, the Feather Spirit Root can adapt 2% per month. That's 40% in twenty months..."

"The precious independent multiplier has grown even stronger."

Zhang Yu silently calculated, "And the Feather Spirit Root's adaptation limit in this area has also increased. Will the final adaptation cap for the Chain Formation Diagram reach 40%? Or maybe even 50%?"

Zhang Yu understood that the adaptation effects varied drastically between different Chain Formation Diagrams. He would need to experiment slowly to figure it all out.

Regardless, this was a massive enhancement.

"It greatly raises the upper limit of my Chain Formation Diagrams."

"The only problem is time. I need time to grow."

"Whether it was the previous Infinite Chain Formation Diagram or the current Feather Spirit Root, enhancing any single Chain Formation Diagram set requires a significant amount of time."

Zhang Yu thought, "This means... in terms of the efficiency of improving my Chain Formation Diagrams, I should currently choose 'specialization' over 'breadth.' I need to focus on one or two diagrams and push them to their absolute limits, rather than developing a wide array of them."

As Zhang Yu pondered, Bai Zhenzhen, who was beside him, also began to feel the power of her evolved True Spirit Root.

Her efficiency in comprehending sword techniques, practicing them, and even improving her basic cultivation stats all became faster and higher. This led to an explosive surge in both her Sword Dao and Immortal Dao talent.

At the same time, she discovered she was adapting to the presence of the Sect Examination Clone within her body.

This adaptation wasn't about her transforming into the clone's appearance; rather, it allowed her to gain greater control over it.

Streams of light from the True Spirit Root also pierced through the Sect Examination Clone, seeking to bring it under her command as well.

In subsequent attempts, Bai Zhenzhen gradually discovered she could actively switch to the Sect Examination Clone. She even began to adapt to and master its Sect Devotee version of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao.

With a flicker of her figure, a wicked smile spread across her face. Radiating an overwhelming evil aura, she lunged toward Zhang Yu.

"Give it here!"

Seeing her hand clawing toward his lower abdomen, Zhang Yu dodged in a flash.

Bai Zhenzhen's body then froze in place, her expression returning to normal.

But the next moment, the Sect Examination Clone was released again. It snarled, "You useless fool! How can your petty love compare to my grand love for the sect?"

"Not to mention... in the future, I can elevate the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao to the Kunxu Devotee level! Ascending from the Sect Devotee Realm to the Kunxu Devotee Realm!"

"Let me go! I need to cultivate with Zhang Yu until the world turns dark, so we can ascend to the Apex of the Immortal Dao together!"

"How can I reach the Kunxu Devotee Realm if I can't cultivate with everyone in the world?"

As Bai Zhenzhen's body stiffened and struggled internally, the Sect Examination Clone was suppressed once more.

Bai Zhenzhen finally said, "Yu Zi, I think I can use my Spiritual Root to suppress the Sect Examination Clone."

"Give me some more time to practice, and I should be able to get better at it."

She had already resolved to completely master the Sect Examination Clone before entering the sect.

At the same time, Bai Zhenzhen also wanted to study and comprehend the clone's Extreme Emotion Sword Dao.

Through her recent Sect Examination studies, Bai Zhenzhen had gained a deeper understanding of the Heavenly Sword Sect. She knew that in her current state, she lacked a sufficient competitive edge within the sect.

"In the Heavenly Sword Sect, Sword Dao and Sword Intent have been pushed to a much more advanced level."

"It's not just the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao that can break through to the Sect Devotee Realm; even other emotions can be transformed into nourishment for the Sword Dao."

"And it's not limited to positive emotions like 'love', even negative emotions can be used..."

Pain, hatred, sloth, greed, lust... Bai Zhenzhen knew that in the current Heavenly Sword Sect, sword techniques fueled by various emotions were rampant. Related industries and research were booming, and she had a lot of catching up to do.

Watching Bai Zhenzhen repeatedly suppress the Sect Examination Clone, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Because she can't completely suppress the clone like I can, did her True Spirit Root evolve the ability to suppress it after its transformation?"

Zhang Yu felt a surge of joy as he watched this scene. With this, Bai Zhenzhen would be much safer in Kunxu.

However, there was still one new ability of the Immortal Spiritual Root, evolved from the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo, that the two had yet to try.

An ability that connected Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu on a deeper level.

The moment Bai Zhenzhen sensed this connection, the True Spirit Root in her lower abdomen suddenly dissolved into light and vanished, leaving her Dantian completely empty.

She could feel that the Spiritual Root hadn't just hidden itself; it had truly disappeared from her body.

Bai Zhenzhen exclaimed in shock, "Holy shit! My Immortal Spiritual Root is gone!"

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu looked at the Dao Seed Register and smiled mysteriously.

The next moment, Bai Zhenzhen felt a sudden heat and tightness in her lower abdomen. Something had entered her Dantian from across space, sending a shiver through her entire body.

Bai Zhenzhen gasped in alarm, "Holy shit, what just entered me?"

When she saw the Feather Spirit Root now residing in her Dantian, she cried out in astonishment, "Yu Zi, is that your Spiritual Root? How did your Spiritual Root just enter me from across space?"

Zhang Yu replied, "A-Zhen, do you feel a new connection between our Spiritual Roots?"

Bai Zhenzhen nodded and said, "I think... I do feel something like that."

Having comprehended the Dao Seed Register, Zhang Yu already understood this new ability. He now explained, "The Feather Spirit Root and the True Spirit Root can now teleport to each other."

With a thought from Zhang Yu, the Feather Spirit Root inside Bai Zhenzhen's lower abdomen suddenly dissolved into light and vanished, returning to his body.

Then, the Feather Spirit Root disappeared again, reappearing inside Bai Zhenzhen.

"Hiss..." Bai Zhenzhen murmured, seemingly unaccustomed to the sensation of teleportation. "So deep... When it teleports like this, it goes much deeper into my Dantian than when you hold me."

Bai Zhenzhen then tried to sense her own True Spirit Root, summoning it back from Zhang Yu's body.

The two spent the next while repeatedly testing this new ability, thoroughly enjoying the game of their Spiritual Roots appearing and disappearing, entering and exiting each other's Dantians.

Besides teleporting their Spiritual Roots, they could also transfer Magic Power to each other through their Immortal Spiritual Roots.

Feeling Zhang Yu's Magic Power being injected into her Dantian and gradually flowing through her body, Bai Zhenzhen sighed, "Yu Zi, this way, we can support each other even if we're far apart."

"I just wonder what the maximum distance this Spiritual Root teleportation can cover," Bai Zhenzhen mused.

Zhang Yu replied, "Within the same layer of Kunxu, it should be no problem."

He thought to himself, "Support is one aspect, but the greatest convenience is how it will help me nourish the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo and further upgrade this Spiritual Root's tier in the future."

Zhang Yu glanced at the Dao Seed Register. The Azure Lotus Sword Embryo, now at the 4th-tier, would require nourishment from a full thirty 50th-level cultivation arts to upgrade further.

"The upgrade requirements have increased so much."

However, Zhang Yu wasn't surprised. Now that the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo had become an Immortal Spiritual Root, it was far more powerful, so it was only natural that upgrading it would require more resources.

"50th-level cultivation arts... the Soul Transformation Realm's upper limit. I'll have to wait until I reach the Soul Transformation Realm to even think about it."

"But with the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo's new ability, once I reach the Soul Transformation Realm, even if A-Zhen is still at the Heavenly Sword Sect, I can just have her teleport her True Spirit Root over, and I'll be able to help her upgrade her Azure Lotus Sword Embryo anytime."

To reach the Soul Transformation Realm, he naturally needed a Soul Transformation Certificate.

Fortunately, the sect wasn't as strict about Soul Transformation Certificates as the Ten Universities.

As far as Zhang Yu knew, Sect Staff started at the 1st Rank upon joining the sect. Upon reaching the 4th Rank, they could obtain a Soul Transformation Certificate, and at the 5th Rank, they could even acquire a Void Refinement Certificate.

After experimenting with the various abilities of his Immortal Spiritual Root, Zhang Yu began to teach Bai Zhenzhen how to use the Dharma-Warding Talisman.

"A-Zhen, you should learn this talisman before you enter the sect..."

After explaining the talisman's function, Zhang Yu warned, "Remember, never share this talisman with anyone you don't absolutely trust. If it leaks to the sect or the Heavenly Court, it will become useless."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded vigorously. "Don't worry, Yu Zi," she said, looking at him. "I won't teach it to anyone else. After all, you're the only person I trust completely."

She then looked at the talisman Zhang Yu was tracing with his fingertip and asked, "Hurry up and teach me how to use it."

Zhang Yu asked, "Huh? You can't understand it? It's quite simple..."

Bai Zhenzhen's expression turned cold. "Are you saying you understood it the first time you saw it?"

Zhang Yu replied, "Of course..."

Bai Zhenzhen retorted, "Bullshit! I don't believe you! You even copied my talisman homework in high school!"

After imparting the Dharma-Warding Talisman to Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu left the cultivation chamber, leaving her to cultivate alone.

He hadn't gone far down the corridor when he saw Yu Xinghan waiting nearby.

Yu Xinghan's gaze swept over him, and a faint golden thread of light seemed to flash across his brow.

He was currently using his upgraded Third Eye Mystic Power to observe Zhang Yu.

In his vision, Zhang Yu's entire body appeared green, except for one tiny spot that glowed with an extremely faint red light.

This was a new ability gained after his Third Eye Mystic Power reached the 4th-tier, allowing Yu Xinghan to see the physical wear and tear on others' bodies.

If a body was completely unharmed, it would appear entirely green.

The more severe the wear, the more the color would shift toward red.

A deeper shade of red indicated greater vulnerability.

"If my previous Third Eye allowed me to see flaws in others' martial arts, then my current Third Eye... lets me see the flaws in their physical bodies."

"By attacking these physical weaknesses, I can achieve greater effects. Truly..."

"What a useless ability. It's not like I go around fighting and killing like Old Man Starfire. Why give me this power?"

"But aside from using it to fight people, it can also be used for self-observation, to monitor my own physical condition and avoid injuries during cultivation or overtime work."

Beyond that, Yu Xinghan hadn't yet figured out any more profitable applications for this ability.

And in Yu Xinghan's Third Eye observation, Zhang Yu's physical body had always been perfect and flawless, seemingly immune to wear and tear, always glowing with green light every day.

But at this moment, a faint red glimmer, so pale it was almost invisible, appeared in Zhang Yu's lower abdomen. It even seemed poised to dissipate after just a few breaths.

Still, Yu Xinghan was surprised. "You're injured?"

Zhang Yu paused, switched his Azure Lotus Sword Embryo to the Third Eye Mystic Power, and glanced at his own body. He instantly understood that this must be a minor injury left over from the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo's upgrade and transformation of his body earlier today.

Zhang Yu shook his head and said, "It's nothing serious."

Then, he frowned at Yu Xinghan. "Why are you so severely worn down?"

In Zhang Yu's vision, the area below Yu Xinghan's abdomen was a deep crimson, as if it were about to burst into flames.

Yu Xinghan, however, smiled confidently and said, "I've just been pushing myself hard with overtime lately. While my seeds can still fetch a good price in the Lower Realm, I want to squeeze out every last drop of my potential before heading to the sect, converting it into my Immortal Dao Potential to be fully prepared for life there."

Having weathered many storms and witnessed life's dramatic ups and downs, Yu Xinghan was no longer the high school student he once was, the one who felt shame and self-doubt over his fluctuating desires.

He... had grown up.

If the current Yu Xinghan were to meet his high school self, he would simply say, "Kid, back then, your spear wasn't fast enough, nor ruthless enough. To reach the Apex of the Immortal Dao, you must cast aside all unnecessary emotions."

Zhang Yu led Yu Xinghan to his office. He had specifically arranged this meeting today to pass the Dharma-Warding Talisman to him as well.

Over the next few days, Zhang Yu continued his preparations, using the resources he controlled within the Ten Universities to bring himself to the best possible state before entering the sect.

Through this focused effort, not only did Zhang Yu's dao heart and physical strength reach the Nascent Soul limit, but his Magic Power finally broke through to 100,000 units, also reaching the Nascent Soul limit.

With this, Zhang Yu's three major base stats all reached their maximum. His Nascent Soul, following the stats hitting their limit, once again received a triple enhancement. His flight speed, cultivation art range, and control distance all increased once more.

Even as Zhang Yu focused on his self-improvement, he didn't forget to complete the handover of his various companies, transferring his authority to some of his more trusted employees.

However, Zhang Yu understood that with his departure and the growing influence of sect disciples like Yun Zhiguang over Myriad Laws and the Ten Universities, the future direction of his companies was now beyond his ability to predict.

On this day, Wang Yin, whom he hadn't seen in a long time, contacted Zhang Yu.

Wang Yin: "True Monarch Blazing Light, could I trouble you to deliver a message to Divine Monarch Nether Spring after you reach the sect?"

Wang Yin: "[100 Spirit Coins] A small token of my respect. Please accept it."

Zhang Yu knew that 100 Spirit Coins was no small sum for the current Wang Yin.

He couldn't help but recall his past conflicts with Wang Yin. To think that the once-lofty President Wang had now become so insignificant before him.

Zhang Yu: "Speak."

Besides Wang Yin, various other acquaintances sought out Zhang Yu every day. For instance, Wen Wuya made a special trip to the Research Institute today to request a meeting with him.

Zhang Yu still felt grateful to this friend who had sponsored him with a considerable amount of Spirit Coins during their university days. He got straight to the point and asked, "What is it?"

Wen Wuya replied, "True Monarch, could you ask Zhenzhen to take me to the Heavenly Sword Sect? I want to do contract work there while preparing for the Sect Examination, to immersively understand the sect environment before returning to take the exam."

Zhang Yu was puzzled. "Why don't you just contact A-Zhen directly?"

Wen Wuya sighed helplessly. "Zhenzhen hasn't replied to me."

In fact, when Wen Wuya first tried to send a message, he discovered it had failed to deliver.

He feared she might have accidentally deleted him as a friend, but his friend request went unanswered. This made Wen Wuya realize he had likely been blocked by Bai Zhenzhen.

"Did Zhenzhen decide to cut ties with us non-sect members after joining the sect?"

The thought sent a pang of pain through Wen Wuya's heart.

But for the sake of entering a sect, he had finally swallowed his pride and come to Zhang Yu today.

Seeing Zhang Yu's friendly attitude, Wen Wuya felt a slight sense of relief.

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's mind stirred. "Could it be that the Sect Examination Clone blocked Wen Wuya back then?"

The more he thought about it, the more likely it seemed. Zhang Yu could only sigh helplessly and say, "I'll pass your message on to Bai Zhenzhen, but her final decision will depend on her own choice."

Not long after his conversation with Wen Wuya ended, four more acquaintances arrived at Zhang Yu's office.

Looking at Shi Huaiyu, Xiao Qingxuan, Shi Yunxiang, and Ying Xin before him, Zhang Yu remarked, "After I enter the sect this time, I probably won't be back for a long while. Before I leave, is there anything else you need my help with?"

Ever since they had fought together to slay the Demonic Sect's Golden Core cultivator, Zhang Yu and the four had become trusted companions.

Later, when Zhang Yu founded his company, Shi Huaiyu and the others had made significant contributions, earning him a substantial amount of money.

But now, facing the Sect Scion Zhang Yu, the four exchanged glances, none daring to make any requests.

Seeing their hesitation, Zhang Yu spoke up. "In other companies, the boss might try to squeeze every last drop of value out of their employees. The more profit they can extract, the more they can exploit their workers to gain greater wealth and status, climbing higher on the path of the Immortal Dao."

"But you should understand that I don't like doing things that way."

"Whether it's raising salaries or distributing Red Packets, it might lose money, and I might be seen as incompetent, but that's just how I want to do things."

"Today, before I leave, I just want to help you all one last time."

"I've said it before: I won't hoard the glory for myself."

As Shi Huaiyu and the others looked at Zhang Yu's sincere expression, memories flooded back: competing together, battling the Demonic Sect's Golden Core cultivator, digging through the Primordial Magnetic Channel, and striving side-by-side in the company.

Shi Huaiyu sighed inwardly. "Yes, Zhang Yu... he's always been this kind of person. Even now that he's about to enter the sect, he hasn't changed. He's the Zhang Yu who would sacrifice his own interests for us, the Zhang Yu we'd entrust our lives to."

With that thought, Shi Huaiyu no longer hesitated. "True Monarch," she said, "I want to take the Sect Examination too."

Seeing the resolute gazes of all four, Zhang Yu sighed inwardly. It was just as he'd expected: the Kunxu People's pursuit of the Immortal Dao was endless.

Zhang Yu immediately sent them a file. "This is a study guide I've compiled for the Sect Examination. It includes my insights and experiences, as well as recommendations for the positions you should apply for. Take it."

"Also, before I leave, I'll find a way to transfer you to the Artifact Refinement Department. That should help with your Sect Examination next year."

Hearing this, joy filled the eyes of the four.

In the days that followed, as Zhang Yu completed one task after another, the day of his departure finally arrived.
