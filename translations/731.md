# Chapter 731: Master, I'm Here

"Zhang Yu!"

Watching the figure that had torn through the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map and burst forth, the Joy God's eyes filled with disbelief.

But despite his shock, his reaction was swift. With a flicker of movement, he shielded his believers, while one of them lifted him and carried him backward in retreat.

Zhang Yu didn't rush to pursue. Instead, with a thunderous roar, he ripped an even larger tear in the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map amid violent tremors.

At the same time, several figures shot out from behind him: True Monarch Desolate Tiger, True Monarch Mystic Fox, True Monarch Heavenly Intellect, and True Monarch Celestial Elephant, who had also been freed.

"Hahahaha!"

Amid wild laughter, True Monarch Desolate Tiger's spirit soared, his aura surging in waves. "To think I, Desolate Tiger, would see the day of my escape!"

Beside him, True Monarch Celestial Elephant looked at Zhang Yu, his eyes filled with gratitude.

After all, Zhang Yu had saved him twice in quick succession: first from True Monarch Heaven Devourer's grasp, and now from the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map. The first time, he had saved his life; the second, his fortune.

True Monarch Celestial Elephant said, "True Monarch Blazing Light, thank you! Once I return and heal my injuries, I'll transfer you the Spirit Coins."

True Monarch Desolate Tiger sighed emotionally. "True Monarch Blazing Light! If it weren't for you this time, not only would my thirty-year ranking streak have been broken, but I would have lost all my wealth. I'll transfer you the money right now."

True Monarch Mystic Fox added, "True Monarch Blazing Light, let's add each other as friends. I'll transfer you money too."

The other Nascent Soul True Monarchs now looked at Zhang Yu with gratitude and a hint of awe for his strength and skill. The image of him tearing apart the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map was still vividly imprinted in their minds.

As the Nascent Soul True Monarchs expressed their thanks and even began transferring him funds, Zhang Yu reminded them, "Everyone, we're not truly safe yet. Let's first deal with this Evil God and his believers."

As Nascent Soul Realm Cultivators, Zhang Yu, Desolate Tiger, and Celestial Elephant all possessed incredibly fast thought and communication speeds. In the brief moment it took for them to break free from the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map, exchange words, and transfer funds, the Joy God and his Evil God Worshippers had only managed to retreat a few meters.

As Zhang Yu communicated with the Nascent Soul True Monarchs behind him, his Bionic Eye, flying swords, and magical artifacts had already locked onto the Joy God.

The Joy God appeared as a dark gold statue the size of an infant, currently cradled in the arms of a believer.

Although the Joy God was surrounded by four believers for protection, being targeted by eight Nascent Soul True Monarchs left him feeling utterly insecure.

This was because among his four protectors, only one was a Nascent Soul Realm Cultivator; the other three were merely at the Foundation Establishment level. The reason for this was that his most powerful believers had all been dispatched to the battlefield.

After all, the battle between the Ten Great Universities and the Righteous Qi Alliance was at its fiercest. The Alliance Leader and the Herald God had naturally deployed the Joy God's strongest forces to the front lines.

Furthermore, from the Joy God's own perspective, the battlefield offered substantial profits. It made sense for his most powerful subordinates to be there earning those profits rather than wasting time by his side.

Even True Monarch Junior College, who had been waiting to livestream, had returned to the battlefield with his men to earn profits and manipulate traffic, unwilling to waste time. He left only one subordinate behind to prepare the stream, and this subordinate was now trailing not far from the Joy God.

"Damn it!"

The Joy God's eyes were fixed on Zhang Yu, his mind still replaying the image of Zhang Yu tearing through the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map.

Even now, he couldn't comprehend how Zhang Yu had accomplished such a feat.

"The Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map is an Immortal Sect Magical Artifact that True Monarch Immortal Slayer brought from his sect! How could Zhang Yu just tear it open from the inside?"

If not for his absolute trust in True Monarch Immortal Slayer and the map, the Joy God wouldn't have guarded Zhang Yu with so few men, leading to this disastrous reversal.

But there was no time for regret. The Joy God knew that in this moment, with the enemy overwhelmingly superior, every second was critical — it would determine whether he lived or died.

So, even as he retreated, the Joy God had already unleashed his Evil God Power, launching his own counterattack.

The Joy God knew he wasn't skilled in direct combat. His true strengths lay in launching attacks from the rear through the Spirit Realm or wreaking havoc in both the Spirit and Dark Spirit Realms.

But now, forced into close combat, he had no choice but to fight.

"If I can't defeat them head-on, maybe I can stall long enough to escape..."

The Joy God immediately projected a line of text: "Gentlemen, can we negotiate a truce?"

While sending this message to distract his opponents, his Evil God Power surged through the Spirit Realm Network, instantly infiltrating all the Bionic Eyes present. He distorted Zhang Yu and the others' vision of him, disrupting their various targeting locks.

Simultaneously, the Joy God's fingertips danced in the air, plucking at the divine power network.

Binding Talisman!

Massive hands formed from divine power erupted, lunging toward Zhang Yu and his companions.

Against a single ordinary Nascent Soul Cultivator, the Joy God's Evil God abilities would have been more than enough, even if he wasn't a master of frontal combat.

But facing him now were eight Nascent Soul True Monarchs — all elite cultivators from the Ten Great Universities.

As the Joy God unleashed his techniques, True Monarch Desolate Tiger and the others also attacked.

Some excelled in martial arts, others in daoist arts. Some were strong in direct combat, while others specialized in stealth operations. Still others were proficient in Spirit Realm attacks, and each possessed magical artifacts to compensate for their weaknesses.

The True Monarchs struck as one, their Nascent Souls materializing behind them in unison.

*Boom!*

With a single step forward from True Monarch Desolate Tiger and his companions, the Joy God's surrounding believers exploded into clouds of blood mist. Only the Joy God and one other Nascent Soul cultivator remained, desperately holding on.

The Joy God fought while retreating, only to realize he had been completely surrounded.

As a torrent of power surged toward him, threatening to annihilate him completely, the Joy God cursed his fate inwardly.

But in the next moment, as his last believer was slain, the Joy God himself was spared. True Monarch Desolate Tiger and the others suppressed him with layers of Gang Qi.

This was, of course, due to Zhang Yu's request that they keep the Joy God alive for now.

Zhang Yu's reasoning was simple: he hoped to extract more intelligence from the Evil God to aid their war effort.

While True Monarch Desolate Tiger and the others subdued the Joy God, Zhang Yu was channeling Kunlun in the Palm and the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier, attempting to suppress the Immortal Sect Magical Artifact, the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map.

Ever since Zhang Yu had escaped from within the artifact, he had felt it pulsing violently, as if trying to soar into the sky and return to its master.

In response, Zhang Yu immediately activated Kunlun in the Palm, repeatedly trying to draw the map into his hand.

But as he continuously constricted his grip, the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map acted like a great fish escaping a whirlpool's undertow, slipping free from Kunlun in the Palm's grasp time and again.

Zhang Yu was forced to activate the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier, erecting one spatial barrier after another to block the map's escape.

Yet, the normally infallible spatial barriers proved as flimsy as paper-mâché before the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map, shattering upon impact.

"What a domineering magical artifact."

Seeing the map about to slip from his control, Zhang Yu steeled his heart. Under the cover of Kunlun in the Palm, he directly opened the entrance to his Immortal Space and lunged to grab the map.

*Boom!*

As the Immortal Space swallowed the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map in one gulp, the artifact erupted in a series of explosions and began to tremble violently.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "The space constructed by the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map is now clashing with my Immortal Space."

If the earlier collision between the two spaces — when he tore the map from within — was like a heavy truck hitting a small car, then this time, Zhang Yu felt as if the Myriad Miles of Rivers and Mountains Map had been run over by a tank.

Amid a series of crackling explosions, the Immortal Sect Magical Artifact instantly lost all its spiritual power and fell with a thud into the Immortal Space.

"Is it completely destroyed?"

Sensing this, Zhang Yu sighed inwardly but felt no regret. Destroying the artifact was far better than letting the enemy reclaim it.

"I'll have to study it later if I get the chance."

With that thought, Zhang Yu temporarily set aside his regret over the map and turned his attention to the suppressed Joy God.

"Everyone, hand him over to me for suppression."

Taking the Joy God from True Monarch Desolate Tiger and the others, Zhang Yu immediately led the group to continue their breakout.

They soon discovered that the stronghold the Joy God had brought them to was his personal domain. With no powerful experts or formidable forces left inside or out, Zhang Yu and his companions quickly overran it.

Meanwhile, the others began contacting the outside world to gather intelligence on the current battle situation.

Zhang Yu, however, took the Joy God to a secluded spot. He activated the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier, instantly erecting layers of spatial barriers to isolate the area. Then, following the ritual Lady Fortune had taught him, he began the process of sealing the Joy God.

Watching Zhang Yu's actions, the Joy God cried out in alarm, "You! How do you know how to perform this ritual?!"

Zhang Yu, of course, wouldn't tell him that Lady Fortune had taught him this sealing ritual after her encounter with the Evil Gods of the Righteous Qi Alliance, just in case.

Zhang Yu still remembered Lady Fortune's words at the time: "This is to teach you how to keep an Evil God fresh if you catch one and I'm not around..."

Although the ritual was complex and required many strange materials, they were fortunately in the Joy God's own domain, so the necessary components were readily available.

As Zhang Yu progressed step by step toward sealing him, the Joy God roared in unwilling disbelief, "You've been an Evil God Worshipper all along?"

"Who is your Boss?"

"WHO IS IT!!!"

With a final, intense cry of defiance, the Joy God transformed into a keychain-sized statue, which Zhang Yu promptly tucked away into his Great Void Cloud Repository.

Shortly after Zhang Yu finished sealing the Joy God, True Monarch Desolate Tiger contacted him.

Having assessed the current situation, True Monarch Desolate Tiger's voice was deep and grave. "True Monarch Blazing Light, the situation is critical. We plan to rest and treat our injuries before rushing to provide support. What are your plans?"

"I'll go ahead," Zhang Yu replied, already outside the stronghold and soaring into the sky.

As he departed, he sent a message to True Monarch Desolate Tiger: "True Monarch Desolate Tiger, please do me a favor. Find a suitable teacher at Celestial Monsters University and, following the joint training procedures, have them transmit the Celestial Demon Myriad Transformations to me as soon as possible."

True Monarch Desolate Tiger didn't hesitate. Such a task was a trivial matter for him.

He was merely curious why Zhang Yu suddenly wanted to learn the Celestial Demon Myriad Transformations.

True Monarch Desolate Tiger suddenly recalled Zhang Yu's impressive monsterfolk breeding abilities displayed during the Ten Greats League.

"Could he be planning to integrate the techniques of the Celestial Demon Myriad Transformations into his own breeding system?" he wondered silently.

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu flew at high speed, shadowy beast figures began to emerge from his body.

Giant dragons, ox monsters, great apes, rocs...

One by one, True Clones emerged from his body, their flesh shifting, swelling, and twisting until they transformed into various Demon Beasts.

This was the combined effect of the Myriad Transformations Self-Sovereign Art and the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture, allowing each of Zhang Yu's True Clones to shapeshift, further enhancing their strength and even granting them the extraordinary talents of monsterfolk and Demon Beasts.

Zhang Yu sought the Celestial Demon Myriad Transformations to conceal these two Immortal Sect techniques, using the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor as cover. He planned to disguise his Demon Beast-transformed True Clones as Demon Beasts he had bred himself.

The Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor could ostensibly only breed aquatic Demon Beasts. With the Celestial Demon Myriad Transformations, however, Zhang Yu could openly use other types of Demon Beast forms.

At the same time, Zhang Pianpian's image appeared in Zhang Yu's bionic eye.

Zhang Pianpian: "Looks like you've escaped."

Zhang Yu replied, "Sis, I've gathered some information and know the situation is dire. Give me the full details."

Zhang Pianpian said, "The true formation node was discovered not long ago. The main forces of both sides have arrived and engaged in several rounds of fierce combat. We're now at the final, decisive moment..."

---

Kunxu's Third Layer.

Grand Void, within the factory complex of Zhang Yu's company.

A solemn and tense atmosphere filled the entire urban district. Every employee was racing against time to work.

Chang Buxiu recalled the news he'd seen yesterday about Zhang Yu's capture by the Righteous Qi Alliance. His brow furrowed involuntarily, and a shadow of gloom crossed his face.

"The news supposedly came from the Dark Spirit Realm. Who knows if it's true or not."

"True Monarch Blazing Light must be safe..."

The thought that the good boss he had finally found might be gone filled Chang Buxiu with a bitter taste.

The only thing he could do now was work harder, pushing production to its limits. He hoped to produce more war supplies for the Nascent Soul and Soul Transformation experts on the front lines, hoping to help the Ten Universities win this battle, hoping they could rescue Zhang Yu.

"We have to win!"

Chang Buxiu roared, his Magic Power surging. He forced his already weary body into action, pushing his work efficiency even higher.

At this moment, within the Ten Schools Campus, vast quantities of supplies were being produced and transported to the front lines every second.

Zhao Tianxing, along with Mo Tianyi, Che Yufei, Hu Yuntao, and others, operated the Great Void Cloud Repository, repeatedly ferrying supplies to the battlefield.

They ascended and descended again and again, watching as more and more supplies were transported upward. But in the combat group chat, the number of dimmed avatars kept increasing.

High in the sky, the streaks of Soul Transformation Divine Light gradually dwindled and faded.

Everything seemed to foreshadow the battle's outcome, heralding the end of the Ten Universities.

When Zhang Yu's avatar in their friends list turned gray, Zhao Tianxing and the others felt their hearts sink.

"Zhang Yu's gone offline too?" Zhao Tianxing had never felt such panic. Zhang Yu's disappearance forced him to confront a question he'd never wanted to consider.

"What if Zhang Yu dies?"

"If the Ten Universities lose, what will we do?"

In that instant, despite not having a physical body for a very long time, Zhao Tianxing felt a suffocating sensation, an illusion of being unable to breathe.

He couldn't stop himself from sending message after message to Zhang Yu.

Zhao Tianxing: True Monarch Blazing Light, are you okay?

Zhao Tianxing: President Zhang? Are you there?

Zhao Tianxing: Zhang Yu, don't scare me!

Zhao Tianxing: [3.234565 Spirit Coins]

Zhao Tianxing: Ah Yu, please don't die! What will we do if you're gone? [Crying Crying Crying]

Mo Tianyi, also in the Spirit Realm, asked, "Old Zhao, did you reach President Zhang?"

Zhao Tianxing murmured, "He didn't reply."

Mo Tianyi roared in anger, "Those bastards from the Righteous Qi Alliance! If President Zhang is really dead, I'll fight them to the death..."

Hu Yuntao said dejectedly, "What's the use of fighting? If President Zhang is really dead... whether the Ten Universities win or the Righteous Qi Alliance wins, it makes no difference to me anymore. I don't care who wins or loses."

Che Yufei shouted, "Stop overthinking! The only thing we can do now is transport more supplies to the front lines and increase the Nascent Soul True Monarchs' chances of victory."

"Even if President Zhang is trapped by the Righteous Qi Alliance, if the Ten Universities can win, we might still have a chance to rescue him!"

Meanwhile, Yu Xinghan and other company leaders issued a corporate notice, explaining that Zhang Yu hadn't gone offline but was simply in a combat zone with poor Spirit Realm signal. They urged everyone to remain calm and continue their work.

After sending the notice, Yu Xinghan threw himself back into his duties, leading teams to repair defensive lines around the Grand Void and helping to repel flanking attacks from individual Righteous Qi Alliance experts.

But as he worked, Zhang Yu's gray avatar kept flashing in his Bionic Eye, filling his heart with bitterness. When he tried to contact Zhang Yu using the Evil God's power, there was still no response.

"It must be the distance, right?"

"Zhang Yu, you bastard... Don't you fucking dare die."

"Worst case, we surrender to the Righteous Qi Alliance. Staying alive is what matters. I'll just follow you and keep working for them."

"But if we join the Righteous Qi Alliance, what about Master and Senior Sister?"

As this thought crossed Yu Xinghan's mind, the images of True Monarch Starfire and Li Xuelian appeared in his thoughts.

"Sigh..."

"But the Ten Universities..."

Gazing at the ever-dimming Soul Transformation divine light in the sky, Yu Xinghan couldn't help but think, "The Ten Universities... they might really not hold out this time. Zhang Yu... what should we do?"

Looking up at the sky, Yu Xinghan felt as if the Soul Transformation Battlefield at the zenith was about to collapse, crushing everything he had worked so hard to build over the years — the company, the assets, the employees he and Zhang Yu had fought to create. It would shatter everything.

And as he watched the sky fall, he was utterly powerless. This feeling of helplessness, of being forced to watch everything crumble into ruin and defeat, relentlessly consumed Yu Xinghan's heart.

---

Elsewhere under the sky, Wang Yin was working overtime in the laboratory, providing support for a project aimed at upgrading spatial equipment and enhancing frontline combat effectiveness.

Even amidst his busy work, he would occasionally glance up at the Soul Transformation Battlefield in the sky.

He watched as the divine light representing Divine Monarch Nether Spring grew dimmer, its brightness already having fallen to 28%.

"Mother is in danger."

Then, Wang Yin looked at his contact list, his gaze falling on Zhang Yu's name, which had turned completely gray.

"Has Zhang Yu fallen too?"

"If Mother dies, who will I leech off in the future? I'll no longer be the Son of a Soul Transformation Expert, just an ordinary Golden Core cultivator."

"And if Zhang Yu has fallen, there'll be no one to help me open the inheritance vaults... I won't even be able to claim my mother's legacy..."

Overnight, it seemed his family and his greatest rival were both on the brink of death. Wang Yin's heart grew increasingly bitter.

Just then, he suddenly received a message from Divine Monarch Nether Spring.

Divine Monarch Nether Spring: I've sent you all the account details and passwords.

Wang Yin's heart jolted. A sudden sense of foreboding washed over him.

Though he had always coveted Divine Monarch Nether Spring's legacy, now that it seemed truly within his grasp, a flicker of unprecedented panic and fear ignited in his heart.

His mother, who had always sheltered and guided him like a towering tree... was she about to fall?

After a long hesitation, he sent a message: "Mom, use more of it yourself. You can leave less for me."

Wang Yin: "I want you to live."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring: "Don't say such spineless things."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring: "Remember, you must secure every single coin of the money I'm leaving you."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring: "If anyone takes it, remember their names. Grow stronger, and then take back ten times what they stole. Not a single coin less."

---

Shi Huaiyu, who was building defensive fortifications on the front lines, was also constantly monitoring intelligence from the battlefield.

As she watched the profile pictures in her contact list go offline one by one, Shi Huaiyu grew increasingly somber. When Zhang Yu's profile picture also turned gray, she finally couldn't help but stop her work.

Shi Huaiyu: President Zhang, what on earth happened?

Watching her messages vanish into the void, Shi Huaiyu's heart grew colder and colder.

When the profile picture of her teacher, Tu Lishan — the Nascent Soul True Monarch of the Civil Engineering Department — also turned gray, the cold in Shi Huaiyu's heart gradually hardened into despair.

Shi Huaiyu: Teacher! Where are you?

No matter what she sent, no reply ever came.

After a long silence, a bank transfer notification appeared on her screen. It was from Tu Lishan, accompanied by a message.

Tu Lishan: "By the time you receive this, I'm probably already dead. But I still have some Spirit Coins left in my account. I'd rather not leave my inheritance to strangers or have it divided among colleagues I dislike. So, after thinking it over, I decided to distribute it myself in advance."

Tu Lishan: "Shi Huaiyu, this portion is for you. Remember, don't use it for crypto trading. All the Spirit Coins will just get moved away by others."

0.5 Spirit Coins received.

She looked up at the sky and murmured, "Teacher..."

---

Kunxu Fifth Layer.

Outside the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation, at the heart of the most intense battlefield.

Tu Lishan's golden body was pierced by countless streams of sword qi. The sword qi clung to him like bone-deep scars, devouring and tearing his body apart.

The one who had slain Tu Lishan was none other than True Monarch Immortal Slayer from the Righteous Qi Alliance.

Tu Lishan was the 35th Nascent Soul True Monarch he had killed today.

*Bang!*

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's figure lunged forward. Their powers clashed in mid-air, their Nascent Souls locked in a fierce struggle.

Unconsciously, several more wounds pierced by sword qi appeared on True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's body.

Gazing at True Monarch Immortal Slayer, who still fought with effortless ease, Heavenly Slaughter sighed inwardly. "This guy's sword technique can convert natural elements — even his opponent's flesh, blood, and Magic Power — into his own sword qi. It's utterly unpredictable and impossible to defend against."

"It must be a Strategic-level Immortal Sect Technique, one I've never seen before."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter thought to himself, "Is it a new creation from the sect?"

Though his mind raced, Heavenly Slaughter's movements never ceased. He continuously attacked True Monarch Immortal Slayer using the Boundless Swiftness Sutra combined with the No Harm, No Kill, No Touch Fist. But the moment most of his power made contact, it was absorbed and transformed into streams of sword qi, which were then turned back against him.

True Monarch Miraculous Hand's Nascent Soul brushed past True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's, sending a message: "Medical Bill: 2801.059 Spirit Coins."

True Monarch Miraculous Hand: "Heavenly Slaughter, take it easy. If you keep fighting like this, I'm afraid you won't be able to afford your medical bills."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter: "Cut the crap. If we don't kill this guy, we're all dead today."

As the battle between True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter and True Monarch Immortal Slayer intensified, a Nascent Soul True Monarch from the Ten Great Universities arrived to reinforce them, joining the siege against Immortal Slayer.

Heavenly Slaughter warned, "Watch out for his sword qi..."

He flickered, providing cover while attempting to coordinate a joint attack.

But in that split second, the newcomer's attack suddenly shifted. Instead of continuing to besiege True Monarch Immortal Slayer, he joined forces with Immortal Slayer to attack True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter.

With a soft squelch, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, already at a disadvantage, revealed a momentary opening. In an instant, True Monarch Immortal Slayer severed one of his arms.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter retreated violently, staring at the Nascent Soul True Monarch now standing beside Immortal Slayer. He spoke coldly, "Severing Clouds... you've defected to the Righteous Qi Alliance?"

True Monarch Severing Clouds, from Heavenly Sword University, was a former disciple of Divine Monarch Blade Commander. He had been responsible for interrogating Bai Zhenzhen during her detention.

Later, due to a subtle move by Zhang Yu that caused a massive industrial upheaval, True Monarch Severing Clouds became a sacrificial lamb, representing Heavenly Sword University in "suffering a little."

After that incident, his status at Heavenly Sword University plummeted, and his assets shrank drastically.

It was only with the outbreak of this great war that he managed to borrow a sum of Spirit Coins and recover much of his strength.

Now, facing True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's gaze, True Monarch Severing Clouds laughed heartily. "Heavenly Slaughter, a wise man submits to circumstances. The Righteous Qi Alliance is on the verge of a great victory. I advise you to surrender early as well."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter didn't reply, merely taking a deep breath as his expression grew increasingly grim.

His gaze flickered briefly toward the Soul Transformation Battlefield in the sky.

Only three Soul Transformation Divine Lights remained from Myriad Laws University, and the brightest among them, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, was only maintaining 38% of her brilliance.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter said coldly, "Dying at your hands is still better than being dealt with by the Heavenly Court."

True Monarch Immortal Slayer's eyelids drooped, his sword qi surging even more violently. He spoke with detached indifference, "Rest assured, dying at my hands is the greatest opportunity, the greatest fortune of your lives."

"In the future, when you look back on this day, you will only be eternally grateful that you died at my hands."

Inside the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation.

At the center of the Soul Transformation Battlefield.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood stood shoulder to shoulder, holding hands.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "Old Gao, can you still hold on?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood nodded. "Don't worry, Yurong. I won't hold you back."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled faintly. "It's a pity... we have no idea what's happening with that boy Zhang Yu. Even if we wanted to help him now, we can't."

Divine Monarch Greenwood sighed. "With his talent, if not for this great calamity, he might have truly entered the sect and climbed to greater heights."

"Indeed," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said with a helpless smile. "But now we can't even protect ourselves. This battle... we've ultimately lost to him."

Together, they looked toward the highest point in the sky of the Soul Transformation Battlefield, gazing at the Soul Transformation Divine Light that remained peerlessly brilliant, shining at its peak brightness — the divine light symbolizing Fu Xiantian.

Just then, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood suddenly noticed that in their communication list, Zhang Yu's profile picture abruptly lit up.

Zhang Yu: Master, I'm here.
