# Chapter 421: The Marvelous Uses of the Minor Threefold Combination

Inside the construction simulation site, Director Gao sat cross-legged in mid-air, his black Daoist robe billowing in the wind. The four large characters on his chest, "Construction World," shimmered with a faint glow.

He gazed approvingly at Zhang Yu before him. "You've excelled in both your studies and your work this second year," he said. "Especially during those business trips — you handled everything flawlessly without drawing unnecessary attention."

"It's all thanks to the opportunities you provided, Director," Zhang Yu replied.

Director Gao chuckled. "Opportunities are earned, not given. Back when Myriad Laws University was just starting, if I hadn't seized the chance to become a teacher, I might still be stuck on construction sites!"

"Not that there's anything wrong with construction work, of course. But the university offered me a broader horizon."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly, listening intently to Director Gao's guidance.

"Sometimes I wonder," Director Gao continued, "how much money is ever enough on the path of the Immortal Dao? It's never enough, Zhang Yu. Spirit Coins are always in short supply."

"You're still young and only at the Foundation Establishment stage. Your current achievements are merely your starting point!"

"Stay grounded and keep earning steadily. At least another 1,000 Spirit Coins. Given the current market... that should last you until you reach the Golden Core stage!"

Listening to Director Gao's advice, Zhang Yu nodded repeatedly in agreement.

Seeing Zhang Yu's obedient demeanor, showing no arrogance despite his outstanding grades, Director Gao nodded in satisfaction.

He had witnessed too many students become conceited after achieving success, losing their groundedness. That's why he seized this opportunity to offer Zhang Yu some guidance.

Director Gao continued, "When it comes to earning money steadily, being grounded is more important than the money itself."

"Some people might strike it rich overnight, but if their cultivation and mental fortitude can't handle that wealth, they'll inevitably lose it all."

"Don't follow their example!"

"Though I'm the director and you're a student, we must both recognize our positions. Never chase wealth you can't control. Even if such money enters your account, it's not truly yours — it's just temporarily entrusted to you by others!"

Zhang Yu's heart stirred again. Is Director Gao talking about Ping Han? Is he worried I'll follow Ping Han into cryptocurrency trading?

Director Gao had indeed intended to warn Zhang Yu against following Ping Han into cryptocurrency trading.

"In the upcoming Military Certificate Examination in October, if Ping Han hasn't lost money, he's likely to secure the Military Certificate!"

"I'm afraid even more people will try to imitate Ping Han's cryptocurrency trading!" Director Gao thought, glancing at Zhang Yu before him. "I need to give this kid a few more warnings. Don't let him get carried away and start trading crypto too!"

After cautioning Zhang Yu, Director Gao casually inquired about a few things:

"How's the Golden Thread Jade Wall working out for you?"

"Is Wen Wuya still in contact?"

"If you get the chance, sell a few more units to the Pharmacology Department. You could also recommend it to others in your department. We have plenty of Civil Engineering students who can sell seeds!"

As he spoke, Director Gao sent Zhang Yu the usage rights for the cultivation art he was about to teach:

"The Third Absolute of the Seven Wonders of Civil Engineering is called Earth Manipulation Divine Transformation!"

"This martial art involves sensing earth energy, using your Magic Power to stimulate the earth's power, and combining it with Martial Dao techniques to achieve earth manipulation!"

"However, its position as the Third Absolute means it now serves as the foundation for the Minor Threefold Combination!"

"Most students rarely use it independently after mastering it."

Next, Director Gao summarized the key points of the Minor Threefold Combination, which he considered the most crucial part of today's lesson.

"The legendary figure who created the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power was a peerless genius from ancient times!"

"He didn't actually create the Seven Wonders of Civil Engineering. Instead, he immediately devised the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power!"

"However, later disciples, realizing the cultivation art was too profound and difficult to teach and learn, painstakingly divided it into five simpler parts. By mastering these five easier techniques, one could naturally comprehend the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power!"

"Later still, to enable Foundation Establishment cultivators to practice this art, someone further split the most challenging of the five techniques into three: the Profound Yellow Mountain-Suppressing Seal, the Great Wilderness Mountain-Shifting Force, and this Earth Manipulation Divine Transformation!"

Director Gao paused, sighing with emotion. "It's precisely because the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power was simplified over time that its practitioners grew in number!"

"Through generations of innovation by numerous cultivators, the art evolved with the times, its power increasing daily. To this day, it remains a military-grade martial technique!"

"Unlike many other supreme martial arts of the past, which either faded due to too few inheritors failing to maintain their power, or were abandoned for being too difficult to master, ultimately becoming museum relics!"

After a moment of reflection, Director Gao proceeded to teach Zhang Yu the cultivation method for the Earth Manipulation Divine Transformation.

A little over an hour later, Director Gao watched as Zhang Yu struck out with his palm. Magic Power and earth energy resonated, causing a cloud of mud and sand to rise into the air. Director Gao nodded in satisfaction.

Zhang Yu's innate talent for martial arts continued to impress him. What pleased him even more was Zhang Yu's composure after mastering the technique, showing no arrogance or complacency.

"Ah, if only Ping Han had possessed Zhang Yu's steadiness, things might have turned out differently," Director Gao mused.

"You've already mastered the first level of the Earth Manipulation Divine Transformation," Director Gao announced. "Now I'll teach you the Minor Threefold Harmony Method."

Following Director Gao's guidance, Zhang Yu circulated his Magic Power. Within moments, he sensed that the cultivation paths of the Profound Yellow Mountain-Suppressing Seal, the Great Wilderness Mountain-Shifting Force, and the Earth Manipulation Divine Transformation could be perfectly aligned.

As he simultaneously activated these three Cultivation Arts, a torrent of Magic Power condensed from his dantian, drawing upon a terrifying force from the heavens and earth.

But in the next instant, the three Cultivation Arts revealed a fundamental flaw. The terrifying force from the heavens and earth merely trembled slightly before severing its connection with Zhang Yu completely.

Beneath Zhang Yu's feet, the earth surged upward as he clasped his palms together, forming two colossal hands of mud and sand that merged into one before him.

"That terrifying force of nature... could it be Earthly Fiend Gravity?"

"The true power one can wield only after mastering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power!"

"The Minor Threefold Combination merely allows control over the earth beneath one's feet, manipulating the metals and minerals within!"

Through Director Gao's teachings, Zhang Yu understood that the potency of the Minor Threefold Combination depended entirely on the level of the three constituent Cultivation Arts.

Though he had cultivated the Profound Yellow Mountain-Suppressing Seal and the Great Wilderness Mountain-Shifting Force to Level 20, his Earth Manipulation Divine Transformation remained at Level 1. Consequently, the Minor Threefold Combination could only manifest at Level 13.4.

"To enhance the Minor Threefold Combination's power, I must raise the level of the Earth Manipulation Divine Transformation!"

"However, beyond mere levels, the effectiveness of this technique... hinges greatly on how it's applied!"

In the next instant, Zhang Yu channeled his Magic Power, his palm seals shifting as the earth beneath him began to undulate like ocean waves.

An earth giant, eight or nine meters tall, burst from the ground with a roar, its arms outstretched in a silent bellow.

Zhang Yu opened his mouth and exhaled. The golden Gang Qi, transformed from the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill, shot toward the giant, instantly solidifying into a hammer and shovel in its hands.

Having swallowed the pill, Zhang Yu could now expel it at will, shaping it into any form he desired.

Another pair of arms sprouted from the giant's back, one catching Zhang Yu's Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch.

Watching the four-armed earth giant holding tools in two hands and the pouch in another, Zhang Yu's mind raced. He pressed one palm downward and raised the other upward, his hand seals shifting again with astonishing speed and precision.

The earth giant, which had stood firmly rooted to the ground moments before, suddenly shattered into countless miniature earth figures that swarmed before Zhang Yu.

Through repeated experimentation with the Minor Threefold Combination, Zhang Yu mused inwardly, "With this method, my operational capabilities have expanded dramatically!"

"But when faced with different environments, what kind of work methods should I use? I still need to experiment more!"

Director Gao watched Zhang Yu's various attempts with a smile, thinking to himself, "Although Zhang Yu's Minor Threefold Combination is still in its early stages and his energy manipulation range is limited, his control is remarkably precise. How can he construct so many forms so quickly?"

---

September!

On the 668th floor of the construction site!

As Zhang Yu's hand seals shifted, streams of mud and sand transformed into human figures, scattering to work.

Zhang Yu was using this job as an opportunity to earn money while practicing his cultivation art.

With each activation of the Minor Threefold Combination, the Earth Manipulation Divine Transformation was also activated, conveniently aiding his cultivation of this technique.

In addition to the mud-formed figures, the Earth-Suppressing Seal, Earthly Fiend Bottle, and Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch floated above Zhang Yu's head, each operated by Mo Tianyi, Zhao Tianxing, and a member of the Ying Family.

Behind Zhang Yu, another Ying Family member manipulated the Golden Thread Jade Wall embedded in the back of his head.

These two members of the Ying Family were none other than Ying Xin's great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather!

Zhang Yu remembered how Ying Xin had introduced her family:

"Senior Brother, my great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather are in their prime, working hard to make a living. They know that if they don't work hard, they'll starve, so their work ethic is impeccable. They're diligent and willing to go the extra mile — I guarantee they won't disappoint you!"

Ying Xin's great-grandfather: "Zhang Yu, rest assured. We're seasoned civil engineers with decades of construction experience. We won't hold you back!"

Ying Xin's great-great-grandfather: "We understand the rules! Major projects like the Civil Engineering Competition are opportunities for us to build our reputation. No matter how much you pay us, we'll give you a 15% kickback!"

Hearing the great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather's self-promotion, Mo Tianyi and Zhao Tianxing grew anxious, fearing they would be replaced. They each offered a 15% kickback as well!

Zhang Yu watched the four diligent Soul Cultivators, who had barely spoken, and thought to himself, "I haven't even made any demands, and they're already competing with each other?"
