# Chapter 150: Zhen, Why Has Your Stomach Gotten Bigger?

Just as Zhang Yu was contacting the three great high schools.

Inside an office at Songyang High School.

Lan Ling said, full of resentment, "...If we just let this matter go, the Student Council will lose all its authority. How will we be able to do our work in the future?"

Zhou Chechen didn't speak, instead contemplating the day's events and the performance of Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

_What gives those two the confidence to act so fearlessly?_

_Is it simple audacity? Or is there someone else besides Zhang Pianpian behind them?_

Listening to Lan Ling, he thought that perhaps he could cancel some of their benefits, like their eligibility for competitions, to probe them further.

And just as Zhou Chechen was thinking this, his phone suddenly vibrated.

Zhou Chechen opened it to find a message from Le Jingchen.

Seeing the strange look on Zhou Chechen's face, Lan Ling asked from the side, "What's wrong?"

Zhou Chechen frowned and said, "The thing Le Jingchen asked us to do, he says he's already handled it himself."

Lan Ling was puzzled. "Handled it?"

Zhou Chechen continued, "Zhang Yu personally went to talk to him, took his money, and will not be participating in the first year's upcoming Dao heart competition."

Lan Ling was shocked. "What? He went to talk to Le Jingchen personally?"

"How did he get in touch with Le Jingchen?"

Just then, Zhou Chechen's phone vibrated again, and his expression changed even more drastically upon seeing the new message.

He said in disbelief, "My bank account has been frozen?"

"For a tax audit?"

Zhou Chechen was extremely confident that there were absolutely no problems with his taxes, so why would he suddenly be audited?

Connecting this to the fact that he had just moved against Zhang Yu, then Le Jingchen and Zhang Yu's private deal, and now his bank account being temporarily frozen…

Lan Ling said from the side, "President, was there a problem with one of the company's procedures? It should be fine once you pay the back taxes…"

"Back taxes? Pay your head." Zhou Chechen's face was grim. "This is clearly a warning from someone. I knew there was more to Zhang Yu than meets the eye."

Lan Ling said, "Could it be the tax bureau…"

Zhou Chechen analyzed, "How could it be the tax bureau, acting so secretively?"

"And they made a move right after we did, contacting Le Jingchen on one hand and freezing my bank account on the other… I'm afraid we've been on their radar for a while now."

Lan Ling's eyes hardened. "Isn't this a threat against us? I'll go find Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen right now…"

"Did you temper your brain into muscle? What's the rush?" Zhou Chechen said irritably. "Zhang Yu is just a dog. What's the use in pinning him down? Besides, the enemy is in the dark while we are in the light. The fact that they dare to warn us like this means they aren't afraid of us at all."

"The top priority is to first investigate who is backing Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen. Once we've figured that out, we can decide whether to endure or to fight back."

"I will tell my father about this and personally arrange for our family's people to investigate."

"Before that, don't be rash. Just act as if nothing happened."

…

Within Songyang High School.

Zhang Yu looked at the message on his phone and let out a small sigh of relief.

It was from the contact Zhang Pianpian had left him, the captain of the Songyang City Patrol Team: The talisman has been sent, and the account has been successfully frozen.

Zhang Yu: Thanks.

The other party replied: It's a small matter. You can come visit me sometime.

Over the next few days, the Student Council, the second-year students, and Zhou Chechen and Lan Ling all remained quiet, as if the incident on the training grounds had never happened.

Zhang Yu also breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that he shouldn't have to worry about them for the time being.

"What I need to do next is simple."

"Continue to cultivate with all my might and refine all this liquid cash into true strength."

And so, in the days that followed, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen continued to advance furiously on the path of the Immortal Dao, consuming the balance in their accounts at an unprecedented rate.

…

The conservation area.

Inside the incubation room.

Zhang Yu was performing a breathing exercise for spiritual energy.

Streams of Great Sun mana circulated within his body.

The next moment, the magma-like mana suddenly broke through several fine meridians in his body. Zhang Yu had just broken through another bottleneck in his mana cultivation.

His mana had surpassed 70 units.

Feeling the flow of his mana after the breakthrough, Zhang Yu revealed a satisfied smile.

Across from him, Xiong Wenwu was also circulating his own breathing exercise.

Zhang Yu said, "Thanks for your help a few days ago."

Xiong Wenwu said faintly, "It was nothing. You two have spent so much money here, it's no big deal for me to help a little."

"Besides, I was just telling the truth. If you and Bai Zhenzhen don't compete, a few of my brothers will have a better chance of getting into the Ten Greats."

Zhang Yu then asked curiously, "Why haven't I seen An'an today? Where is she?"

Xiong Wenwu shook his head and sighed. "An'an is consoling the others."

"Because she took a pay cut."

Zhang Yu was puzzled. "Huh? She got a pay cut, so why is she consoling others?"

Xiong Wenwu said slowly, "Because she's the best employee in the conservation area, she was asked to take the lead in accepting a pay cut, which means everyone else will have their salaries cut one after another."

"The manager told her to do ideological work with the other employees, to understand the company's difficulties, and to share in its hardships."

Zhang Yu could only offer some comfort, "Companies… they're all like that."

Xiong Wenwu said angrily, "She's clearly the most dedicated employee with the most company spirit in the entire conservation area, so why does she earn the least and eat the worst? And when the company's profits decline, she's asked to take the lead in cutting pay?"

"How is that any different from the top student in the class having their benefits cut?"

Hearing this, Zhang Yu fell silent for a moment, not knowing what to say to comfort him.

Xiong Wenwu continued, "This all proves… there's something wrong with the company. It's failing to reward its truly outstanding employees."

Xiong Wenwu could sense that there was definitely a problem with the company. Not only were various bases and factories being acquired, but there was also some chaos in the upper management.

_But it's soon…_ Xiong Wenwu thought to himself. _I've almost saved up enough money to help An'an pay off her breeding debt._

_Then she'll be able to leave this place._

…

White Dragon High School.

Song Hailong was sparring with Bai Zhenzhen.

But faced with Bai Zhenzhen's ghostly movement technique, he found it increasingly difficult to land a hit.

Song Hailong could only counter the unchanging with the ever-changing, standing like a reef against Bai Zhenzhen's stormy assault, trying his best to find an opening.

But Bai Zhenzhen was like a bolt of lightning, always darting into his blind spots, forcing him to constantly adjust his posture and try to catch her figure.

Just then, Bai Zhenzhen's figure flashed, and she retreated more than ten meters away, coming to a stop.

Song Hailong frowned. "What's wrong?"

Bai Zhenzhen glanced at the White Dragon students outside the door and said, "I say, you guys have been watching us train for a long time, haven't you?"

Chu Qiuhe and the others quickly knelt on the ground, indicating that they would definitely watch from their knees from now on.

Bai Zhenzhen said, "That's not what I meant."

"I meant that watching our training… costs money."

Song Hailong was about to say they should forget it.

But then he heard Zhang Yu from not far away add, "That's right. Can you watch people of our caliber for free? We should be charging money."

Yu Xinghan nodded and said, "Then let's charge an admission fee."

A moment later, the training room was packed with people.

A large group of White Dragon students stood on the periphery, craning their necks to watch the four people fighting.

As for the kneeling spots further in the front, which offered a clearer view, those required an extra fee.

Before leaving White Dragon High School that day, Yu Xinghan said to Zhang Yu, "There's a lead on the Spirit Realm matter. I'll help you two arrange it in a few days."

…

Late July.

Less than half a month remained before the first round of the Foundation Establishment qualification exam.

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen continued their brave, money-fueled advance on the path of the Immortal Dao. As money flowed away rapidly and large quantities of various resources were consumed, their progress was unprecedented.

Zhang Yu's mana broke through to 81.5, and his physical strength reached 7.52. These two fundamentals had completely surpassed the average level of a White Dragon student just entering their third year.

Only the progress of his Dao heart was very slow, currently at level 5 (85%).

And Zhang Yu's bank balance had also dropped to just over 200,000.

In the apartment that night.

Just as Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen were continuing their diligent cultivation.

Bai Zhenzhen suddenly said, "Yu-boy, do you feel like my stomach has gotten bigger?"

Zhang Yu looked up and said, "It seems a little bigger?"

Bai Zhenzhen patted her lower abdomen. "I feel like it's protruding a bit. Can't you see?"

Zhang Yu looked closely, and a look of shock suddenly appeared in his eyes as he saw faint cyan patterns appearing on Bai Zhenzhen's lower abdomen.

And Bai Zhenzhen also said in surprise, "Why has my spiritual root gotten smaller?"

In Bai Zhenzhen's perception, the True Spiritual Root that had been steadily established in her dantian's sea of qi, which one moment was performing breathing exercises and nourishing her flesh and blood.

The next moment, it gradually contracted, turning into a cyan seed in her perception.

When Bai Zhenzhen told Zhang Yu about this change, Fu Ji said, "It's evolved."

Fu Ji explained, "I told you long ago, this spiritual root of Bai Zhenzhen's is an evolutionary spiritual root."

"It's just that… in the past years, before Bai Zhenzhen embarked on the path of the Immortal Dao, this spiritual root was still in its infancy, only changing slightly with Bai Zhenzhen's choices."

"But ever since she enrolled in her first year and truly stepped onto the Immortal Dao, her spiritual root has been frequently stimulated, changing more than it had in all the previous years combined."

"Especially after you started exchanging its use with her, every one of your level 10 cultivation techniques has given this spiritual root an even stronger stimulus, and today, it has finally evolved."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu also told Bai Zhenzhen his speculation about the spiritual root's evolution.

Then Zhang Yu said, "Try to sense what the evolved True Spiritual Root can do. Does it have any new abilities?"

Hearing this, Bai Zhenzhen immediately focused all her attention on the True Spiritual Root.

As her mind invested in it, an ethereal feeling gradually spread throughout her entire body.
