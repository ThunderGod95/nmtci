# Chapter 534: Kunxu's Zero-Yuan Shopping Spree

"Stealing shit! Stealing shit!"

"Get out of here! It's all mine!"

"Hahahaha, I haven't eaten this much in ages!"

Watching the Qi Refining students' frenzied behavior, Zhang Yu and Mo Shangjin casually unleashed a sweeping wave of Earthly Fiend Gravity, instantly knocking them unconscious.

This was the third wave of Demonic Sect members they had encountered on their journey. Though these sect members were clearly impoverished vagrants who had been wandering the streets for days, their presence still sent shivers down the spines of many Civil Engineering Department students. None of them had realized how many Demonic Sect followers had infiltrated University City unnoticed!

As the group advanced, they discovered that as time passed, with no Righteous God monitoring them, no surveillance systems in place, and no suppression from the university's higher-ups, more and more people began to act out of line, plunging University City into increasing chaos!

A passerby killed a Demonic Sect member in a fight and stripped the corpse of its Bionic armor!

Others joined the sect members in storming shops and looting their supplies!

Demonic Sect members, chanting about reincarnation and being reborn into better lives, launched suicide attacks, further intensifying the fighting and causing even more casualties!

Burning, explosions, corpses, fierce battles, and the occasional violent tremors from deep underground...

As the group gazed at University City before them, they felt as if the place had become utterly foreign, unlike anything they had ever known.

"Teacher Tu Lishan."

Before Tu Lishan's group could even catch their breath, a figure wreathed in black smoke had already engaged him in combat.

Sensing the surging Golden Core-level Magic Power from both sides, Zhang Yu and Mo Shangjin simultaneously activated their Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, leading the group in a rapid retreat.

However, the sheer terror of a Golden Core-level battle proved too much for the Foundation Establishment students. The shockwaves scattered the group, and the once-united team quickly splintered apart.

Zhang Yu glanced around and found that Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan, Xiao Qingxuan, Shi Huaiyu, and Shi Yunxiang — the five companions who had emerged from the dormitory with him — had remained tightly by his side, managing to avoid being separated.

---

Meanwhile, outside Zhang Yu's dormitory, a "man" smashed through the door. Seeing the room empty, he sighed, "They're gone?"

Behind him, a massive figure shrouded in dense black mist spoke calmly, "Is this the place you said Zhang Yu lived?"

The "man" nodded. "That's right, it's Zhang Yu! He's not only a Heavenly Chosen in the Civil Engineering Department, but he also obtained his Military Certificate in his third year and mastered Level 20 Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. He even transferred to the Artifact Refinement Department — his innate talent is truly astonishing!"

"Moreover, he participated in the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact Experiment, gaining significant benefits and undoubtedly possessing classified information about the experiment!"

The imposing figure smiled faintly. "He's precisely the kind of talent our Cult needs. If we can successfully recruit him, the Cult Master will be overjoyed and reward us handsomely!"

With that, the imposing figure turned to the "man" and asked, "Do you think he'll willingly join the Cult?"

The "man" replied solemnly, "Zhang Yu has helped me so much. How could I stand by and watch him continue to wallow in the mire set by the Ten Great Sects? Whether he's willing or not, I'll force him to join the Cult!"

If only I knew where they've gone!

The imposing figure waved his hand dismissively. "No matter! The so-called collapse of the Spirit Realm doesn't mean it has vanished. The Cult Master has merely temporarily hijacked the Spirit Realm within and surrounding Myriad Laws University!"

At that moment, the Spirit Realm was inaccessible to the faculty and students of Myriad Laws University.

"But for us, we can still tap into a portion of the Spirit Realm's power to mobilize nearby resources!"

"Now that we've located Zhang Yu's former residence, finding him again will be easy!"

With a flick of his finger, the imposing figure summoned surveillance footage from the dormitory area.

"Oh? It's Mo Shangjin?"

"Perfect! We'll take him along too!"

---

Moments later, on the shattered street, Mo Shangjin knelt, covered in blood, staring in shock at the "man" before him and the imposing figure behind him. His face twisted in anger. "You..."

The "man's" appearance had been deliberately distorted, making his original features unrecognizable. Yet even through the disguise, a hint of malicious glee shone through his expression.

Watching the once-arrogant Senior Brother now kneeling before him, beaten and humiliated, the "man" couldn't suppress a triumphant laugh.

"Senior Brother Mo Shangjin, never thought you'd see this day, did you? Kneeling before me? What good are your perfect grades now? You'll all join the Demonic Sect, just like me!"

With a soft pop, the burly figure shattered Mo Shangjin's last resistance. After knocking the man unconscious, he casually hoisted him over his shoulder.

"Let's go. There's still Zhang Yu!"

The "man" hurried after the burly figure, his heart soaring with growing arrogance.

"Zhang Yu... I'm coming for you!"

The thought of Zhang Yu stirred a bitter resentment within him.

"Zhang Yu... why did you help Le Mulan, Yu Xinghan, Ying Xin... why did you help so many others but refuse to help me?"

His true feelings starkly contradicted his earlier words. Now, his desire to force Zhang Yu into the Cult stemmed not from gratitude, but from deep-seated resentment.

"Over the past few years, how many times have I shown you goodwill? How many times have I begged you? I've gone to every length to please you, yet what did you do? For days, I've waited outside your door like a dog, pleading and waiting endlessly just to obtain a sliver of magic power!"

Li Xiao's heart surged with furious rage. "Zhang Yu! You've been toying with me, toying with me and Ji Yuanshu!"

"Why couldn't you have helped us more?"

"If you had just given us a little more help, Ji Yuanshu might not have died, and I might never have joined the Demonic Sect..."

Tormented by the economic crisis, Li Xiao experienced an unprecedented wavering in his belief in the Immortal Dao and his future!

This doubt intensified when he compared himself to Zhang Yu, surging with endless jealousy, envy, and resentment in his heart!

We're both from the First Layer, so why is the gap between us so vast?

We're both from the First Layer, so why help Yu Xinghan instead of me?

They have so many resources! Just a tiny fraction of what they have could have saved me from this crisis!

These emotions reached their peak after Ji Yuanshu's death!

Driven by this rage, Li Xiao joined the Unemployed Sect and eagerly provided information about Zhang Yu.

The Unemployed Sect showed great enthusiasm about recruiting Zhang Yu.

At that moment, Li Xiao finally spotted Zhang Yu and his companions in the distance. A twisted sense of satisfaction surged through him.

"Heh, Zhang Yu... No matter how good your grades are, how remarkable your department transfer was, or how much of an academic overachiever you became in the Artifact Refinement Department, in the end, you'll still end up like me, joining the Demonic Sect! Hahahahaha!"

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu and his group whirled around, their eyes locking onto the imposing figure charging toward them from behind, followed by Li Xiao!

Seeing Mo Shangjin being held captive by the figure, Zhang Yu's heart sank.

At the same moment, the massive figure lightly tapped his fingertip, seemingly activating the power of the Spirit Realm.

Formation energies surged to life, instantly sealing off the entire area.

With a series of thunderous booms, the surrounding streets and buildings warped and transformed, rising like towering city walls to completely block off the space.

The massive figure finally spoke, his voice calm and measured: "You may call me Wuying."

"There are no Spirit Realm surveillance systems here, and I've temporarily sealed off the surrounding structures. No outsiders can hear our conversation."

"Zhang Yu, I invite you to join the Unemployed Sect!"

He then turned to the others present, offering a slight smile: "Of course, all of you are welcome to join as well!"

"I'm sorry, but the Unemployed Sect's damage to resumes is too severe. I'll have to decline for now," Zhang Yu replied with a forced smile, his mind racing to devise a plan.

Wuying said calmly, "Why not hear our terms first? If you join the sect, you'll have access to all the cultivation arts we possess."

"Not just expert-level techniques, but also military-grade cultivation techniques. We can even transmit those to you."

"And it's not limited to Myriad Laws University. Our sect has connections to military-grade cultivation techniques from other universities as well..."

Zhang Yu's heart sank at the revelation. "If what he's saying is true, then the Unemployed Sect has moles in multiple universities? That's the only way they could have gathered military-grade cultivation techniques from various institutions."

Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "Too bad you don't have any proof, right?"

Wuying replied calmly, "Why should we be bound by such trivialities on the path of the Immortal Dao? Mastering profound cultivation arts naturally enhances one's strength. What difference does a mere certificate make? It's just a matter of lacking some superficial reputation and worldly possessions!"

Zhang Yu sneered inwardly, realizing that if he truly practiced the cultivation art offered by Wuying, he would become a pawn firmly held in the sect's grasp.

Noticing the change in Zhang Yu's expression, Wuying sighed. "It seems you harbor many misunderstandings about our Cult. I have no choice but to subdue you first and then discuss matters at length."

Before Wuying could finish speaking, Zhang Yu's Gang Qi erupted violently, instantly transforming him into the Mountain-Shifting Warrior state!

The Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power and the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force erupted simultaneously, unleashing their full might from the start. Mountain-Shifting Nine Heavens, Thousand-Handed Sacred Martial.

Streams of Gang Qi surged forth like countless powerful warriors striking in unison, relentlessly assailing Wuying from all directions!

Amidst earth-shattering booms and ground-shaking tremors, Wuying's figure was engulfed by waves of golden, flame-like Gang Qi!

But in the next instant, before the stunned eyes of the crowd, Wuying effortlessly tore through the Gang Qi and lightly tapped Zhang Yu's chest with a single finger!

With a sharp crackling sound, Zhang Yu's golden armor shattered instantly, and a bloody hole erupted in his chest!

"Golden Core," the crowd murmured, their hearts pounding with fear as they sensed the overwhelming surge of Magic Power emanating from Wuying.

Wuying said calmly, "If you cooperate and come with me quietly, you'll suffer less."

Just when everyone thought the battle was over, Zhang Yu suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, the blood energy mixed with Gang Qi surging toward Wuying!

Wuying casually dispersed the blood energy with a wave of his hand, then unleashed another palm strike from a distance, sending Zhang Yu flying backward once more!

This time, Wuying's brow furrowed slightly. He found Zhang Yu's resilience to be almost absurd!

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's mind raced: "Should I use the Divine Spiritual Root?"

"Foundation Establishment versus Golden Core... my chances of winning are zero!"

"If I activate the Divine Spiritual Root's hidden ability, I might find a chance to escape! But it would expose my secret!"

Zhang Yu knew that once this secret was revealed, it wouldn't just be exposed to the Demonic Sect, but also to Yu Xinghan and the others!

As for joining the Demonic Sect, that was the worst of all options. He even suspected that if he joined, the retarded ritual would immediately activate and kill him!
