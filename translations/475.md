# Chapter 475: Did I Come at the Wrong Time?

As Wen Wuya tracked Zhang Yu through the incredibly advanced surveillance system within Heavenly Sword University's campus, he gradually realized something.

"Does observation always require secrecy?"

What better vantage point could there be than to immerse oneself in the situation, to be part of it?

Moreover, based on his understanding of Zhang Yu, money could solve any problem. Weren't the poor of the First Layer all like that?

Seeing Zhang Yu's repeated retreats, Wen Wuya's expression shifted to surprise. His small mouth parted slightly as he stared at Zhang Yu in astonishment.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu gazed at the slender, curvaceous "woman" before him, feeling utterly awkward.

He knew perfectly well that the body before him was beautiful. After all, he had personally designed it, ensuring every dimension and proportion aligned perfectly with his aesthetic preferences — a quintessential Earthly beauty.

But the mere thought that this was Wen Wuya, the man, in disguise made him want to reach into his own brain and tear apart every stray thought that had dared to surface.

Hearing Wen Wuya's suggestion, Zhang Yu retorted sharply, "What nonsense are you spouting? Don't even think about it!"

Wen Wuya looked at Zhang Yu in confusion, then touched his own chest and said, "I've never used this body for cultivation with anyone before because it's not particularly attractive!"

"But since you designed this appearance, I figured you'd be into this sort of thing."

"As the designer, wouldn't you want to test out how practical your creation is?"

Zhang Yu waved his hand dismissively. "Stop talking nonsense in front of me. I'm focused on cultivation and have never considered such things!"

"Is that so?" Wen Wuya chuckled. "But your conscious thoughts might not align with your body's desires!"

Zhang Yu opened his mouth to protest, but found himself speechless.

Earlier, when he had embraced Wen Wuya, he had intended to inject the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo from his Divine Spiritual Root into Bai Zhenzhen's body. Clearly, Wen Wuya had misunderstood his intentions.

Wen Wuya continued, "Besides, I can pay you. How much do you want? Thirty Spirit Coins? Fifty? We can negotiate!"

"Shut up! I have absolutely no interest in what you're saying. Leave now. I don't want to see you!" Zhang Yu retorted.

It wasn't entirely true. Zhang Yu had to admit that when Wen Wuya offered 30 Spirit Coins, then 50, he had felt a momentary flicker of temptation.

Kunxu.

"Look what you've turned me into!"

Zhang Yu lowered his head, avoiding Wen Wuya's gaze. "That bastard Wen Wuya," he thought bitterly. "Trying to corrupt my will with money. He actually made me waver for a moment."

"Not just a moment!" Lady Fortune thought, overhearing Zhang Yu's internal monologue. "You hesitated at least three times!"

"This is ridiculous!"

Lady Fortune shook her head in exasperation. "What's there to hesitate about?"

"Just do it!"

Lady Fortune said, her voice dripping with exasperation, "Wen Wuya is a Soul Transformation disciple, and he's offering you money! Why would you pass up such an immortal fortune?"

"If he were recruiting at Myriad Laws University, students eager to cultivate with him would line up from the 1st floor to the 669th!"

"And you're still hesitating... Are you even a true Immortal? Do you still dream of joining the Ten Great Sects? When opportunity knocks, why are you so useless?"

"Zhang Yu, what are you hesitating about?"

As Lady Fortune's question echoed in his mind, Zhang Yu realized she was right.

"Indeed, cultivating with a Soul Transformation disciple would be a tremendous opportunity for most students. And I'd even get paid for it!"

"Besides, her appearance perfectly matches my aesthetic preferences."

"Moreover, given the immense power of a Soul Transformation disciple, she must possess a Dao Seed. If I engage with her deeply, I might even catch a glimpse of it..."

"Whether it's cultivation, money, or the Dao Seed, there's nothing to lose and everything to gain. So... why am I even considering refusing?"

But Zhang Yu knew there was a reason... a reason he couldn't accept.

Under Lady Fortune's relentless questioning, Zhang Yu confessed mentally, "But... her original gender is male! I can't bring myself to accept that!"

"Is that all?" Lady Fortune sighed. "You're already a Third-Year student with a Level 20 Dao Heart, and you still haven't overcome such a trivial inner flaw? A woman with a male original gender is enough to stop you? How are you any different from those wastes on the First Layer?"

"Zhang Yu, I'm so disappointed in you! Do you remember what you told me in your senior year of high school? You wanted to get into Joyful Union University, but now you can't even overcome this small hurdle?"

Hearing this, Zhang Yu lowered his head in shame, frustrated by his own weakness.

"Damn it! I've already come to Kunxu, to another world. Shouldn't I adapt to local customs? Shouldn't I embrace the values of this era? Why am I still bound by the past?"

"Besides, even on Earth, many people wouldn't find this situation unacceptable!"

"Why? Why can't I do it?"

Lady Fortune encouraged him, "Zhang Yu, I can sense your inner turmoil, your burning resolve. Go, train fiercely with Wen Wuya to mend the flaws in your heart and fuel your journey on the Immortal Dao."

Zhang Yu gritted his teeth and turned to look at Wen Wuya, but his courage quickly faltered.

"No, I really can't do it!"

Just then, a cold, clear voice rang out from behind him.

"Did I come at a bad time?"

Zhang Yu whirled around to see Bai Zhenzhen approaching, a wave of relief washing over him. "Finally, I don't have to test myself anymore! A-Zhen has always been vehemently opposed to Dual Cultivation, insisting on celibate Immortal cultivation. She'd never agree to something like Wen Wuya joining us!"

Wen Wuya turned to Bai Zhenzhen with a chuckle. "You've arrived at the perfect moment! I was just discussing with Zhang Yu whether I could join you both in a three-person Dual Cultivation session, but he seems dissatisfied with the price."

Bai Zhenzhen flatly rejected the idea. "Absurd! Don't even think about it!"

Zhang Yu exhaled softly, thinking, "That's right, A-Zhen. Give him a firm rejection."

Bai Zhenzhen continued, "However, I wouldn't mind if you and Zhang Yu engaged in one-on-one Dual Cultivation."

Zhang Yu glared at Bai Zhenzhen, cursing inwardly. "A-Zhen, what nonsense are you spouting? All those years of being a good father and daughter for nothing! If you truly understood me, you'd never say such a thing."

But then, a different thought struck him. "Wait... could A-Zhen be trying to mend the cracks in my resolve, giving me a push forward on the Immortal Dao?"

Bai Zhenzhen added, "Though I have no objection, I doubt Zhang Yu would agree."

Zhang Yu shook his head with a wry smile, thinking to himself, "Of course, the one who understands me best... it's you, my dear sister A-Zhen. You don't want me to go against my true nature either, do you?"

Bai Zhenzhen raised a finger and declared, "If it were Zhang Yu, he'd demand at least 100 Spirit Coins!"

"You little..." Zhang Yu cursed inwardly, but then Bai Zhenzhen turned to him, winking and sending him a message:

"Bai Zhenzhen: Don't worry! You rarely come to Heavenly Sword University. I'll make sure you get a good price!"

Lady Fortune chimed in, "This is a good thing, Zhang Yu. Bai Zhenzhen is helping you."

Zhang Yu opened his mouth to protest, but he hesitated. His "original gender" excuse felt flimsy and embarrassing to voice.

Suddenly, his eyes lit up. "I came here to transfer my Divine Spiritual Root with A-Zhen," he told Lady Fortune. "Every moment after the transfer will enhance my cultivation. Who has time for Wen Wuya?"

He was also immensely curious and excited about the potential effects of exchanging two Azure Lotus Sword Embryos.

Lady Fortune nodded in agreement. Zhang Yu then patted his lower abdomen, subtly hinting at the Divine Spiritual Root matter to Bai Zhenzhen.

He decided against sending a message, realizing the Divine Spiritual Root was too important. He feared that sending a message from Heavenly Sword University might leak the information.

Bai Zhenzhen immediately understood Zhang Yu's intentions.

"Yu Zi is so impatient!" she thought. "Can't he wait to use my Divine Spiritual Root? He's even willing to forgo this money?"

"It seems the Divine Spiritual Root is truly crucial for him."

With this realization, Bai Zhenzhen abruptly ended her negotiations with Wen Wuya. "I've changed my mind," she declared. "Zhang Yu will be spending his time with me from now on. It has nothing to do with you."

Wen Wuya was taken aback by her sudden shift in attitude. "Are you certain?" he asked.

Bai Zhenzhen glanced at Zhang Yu. "Zhang Yu, is that what you want too?"

She waved her hand, blocking Wen Wuya's path. "I've made up my mind. Leave."

Seeing her resolve, Wen Wuya sighed. Before departing, he said, "Contact me if you change your mind."

"Where did you get that outfit?" Bai Zhenzhen demanded. "Give it back."

"I bought an identical style myself," Wen Wuya replied calmly.

She casually patted her chest. "Look for yourself — the sizes are completely different."

In the blink of an eye, Wen Wuya vanished from their sight.

Bai Zhenzhen tightly embraced Zhang Yu from behind. Zhang Yu smiled faintly, returning the embrace and whispering in her ear, "I have a surprise for you later!"

Bai Zhenzhen pressed herself against Zhang Yu, feeling the warmth radiating from his body. Suddenly, her brow furrowed.

Both Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen thought simultaneously, "What's poking me?"

But in the next instant, they realized what it was and exchanged amused glances. Zhang Yu chuckled, "A-Zhen, you haven't changed at all!"

"He thought to himself, "This one's still the same — trying to get me to use her Divine Spiritual Root right away!""

Bai Zhenzhen glared at Zhang Yu with mock disdain. "You haven't changed either!"

"She thought to herself, "Tch, Yu Zi still can't control himself!""

They smiled at each other, feeling as if they had been transported back to their high school days, when they would cultivate together in each other's arms.

But then Zhang Yu's expression shifted. "Wait a minute, A-Zhen doesn't know I have a Divine Spiritual Root too. So when she said "still the same"..."

"Damn it, she's misunderstanding me again."

As Zhang Yu struggled to find an explanation, Bai Zhenzhen spoke, "Don't move around now."

"Just hold me. No unnecessary movements."
