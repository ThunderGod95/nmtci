# Chapter 690: Tiger of Myriad Laws, Technological Revolution

After finally finishing the design blueprint, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole reluctantly withdrew her gaze.

As she regained her senses, she noticed the other nine Soul Transformation Experts from the universities staring at her, their eyes filled with anger, desire, or resentment. Magnetic Pole couldn't help but chuckle.

She understood that she now held the initiative in the entire assembly.

"Gentlemen..." Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said with a faint smile, "There's no need to be tense or worried. I, Magnetic Pole, am not a petty person. I'm willing to share this design blueprint with all of you and make the technology open-source."

Divine Monarch Bloodfall of Netherworld University wasn't so easily swayed. "Just state your conditions directly, Magnetic Pole."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "Given that research and exploration in spatial technology will be ongoing for the foreseeable future, the costs shouldn't be borne solely by Myriad Laws, should they?"

Listening to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's subsequent remarks, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus of Heavenly Demon University thought to himself, "Hmph, she's here to collect protection fees, isn't she?"

---

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu had followed Divine Monarch Greenwood outside the venue.

Gazing at the ten flickering Soul Transformation lights emanating from the distant building, Zhang Yu knew this was where the Ten Universities Soul Transformation Experts were holding their closed-door meeting.

"I wonder how Teacher Magnetic Pole and the principals of the other nine universities are faring in their discussions?" he thought to himself.

Just then, a figure slowly approached Divine Monarch Greenwood, smiling softly. "Greenwood, long time no see."

Zhang Yu turned to see a woman in regal palace attire, her every gesture radiating noble grace.

Instead of advertisements, data representing various assets flickered across her body — each flicker seemed to symbolize the rise of countless fortunes, the sudden wealth of some, and the ruin and annihilation of countless others.

These simple numerical fluctuations conveyed the profound mysteries of humanity and the workings of society, reflecting the survival and destruction of billions of lives upon her very being.

"Divine Monarch Nether Spring..." Zhang Yu scanned the Dao title above her head, thinking to himself, "The new Soul Transformation Expert from Netherworld University?"

Divine Monarch Nether Spring said, "Greenwood, your decisive victory against the enemy formation was truly awe-inspiring and domineering. The outside world now calls you the Tiger of Myriad Laws."

Divine Monarch Greenwood, standing nearby, replied calmly, "I merely fulfilled my duty."

Nether Spring continued, "How did you decide to target Treasure Flow? That scoundrel stole a significant amount of resources from our university, and his cultivation has advanced rapidly in the past year. He's no easy opponent."

Greenwood replied calmly, "My purpose in breaking the formation was simply to test the power of the World-Piercing Cone. Naturally, I chose the most dangerous location. Besides, I despise those parasitic worms in the Finance Department who betray their own kind. I'll crush every last one I encounter."

Nether Spring chuckled softly. "Greenwood, your aura has grown even more majestic since achieving Soul Transformation."

"Speaking of which, do you still have the World-Piercing Cone? I've never seen that magical artifact before. Could you show it to me?"

Greenwood firmly refused. "I've already returned the World-Piercing Cone to storage. If you want to see it, ask Magnetic Pole."

Nether Spring chuckled again and turned to Zhang Yu. "You're Zhang Yu, right? A very promising student."

She turned to Zhang Yu and said, "Zhang Yu, my son has benefited greatly from your guidance." Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback. Nether Spring continued, "Wang Yin, don't you remember? He's my son."

"But don't worry, I won't interfere in matters between you juniors. Besides, without your encouragement, he wouldn't have made such remarkable progress."

With that, Nether Spring smiled at Zhang Yu again, greeted Divine Monarch Greenwood, and transformed into a beam of divine light, vanishing into the air.

Divine Monarch Greenwood warned, "Zhang Yu, don't be fooled by that woman's cheerful demeanor. Every cultivator who climbs the ranks at Netherworld University is a ruthless character. Nether Spring is especially so. Even before becoming a teacher at the University, she was a notorious Heart-Eating Cultivator, known for making people willingly offer their hearts to be devoured..."

Just then, the massive building ahead trembled slightly, and ten beams of divine light shot skyward, scattering in different directions.

One of the divine lights paused briefly, hovering above Divine Monarch Greenwood's head, from which Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's displeased voice boomed.

"Greenwood, do you realize how your unauthorized attack has disrupted the battle lines and undermined the plans and operations of all the academies?"

This exchange immediately drew the attention of the numerous cultivators present, who all turned to stare at Divine Monarch Greenwood. Many secretly began recording the scene.

Divine Monarch Greenwood gazed up at the divine light, his head held high, and declared, "Today's battle was fought to my satisfaction, and I will bear the consequences alone. If anyone has grievances, challenge me to a duel — I accept all challenges."

At that moment, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's majestic voice reverberated through the air: "Sinful Lotus, I authorized Greenwood's actions today. Do you still have any objections?"

A cold snort like thunder erupted, sending a cascade of lightning crackling through the sky. In the next instant, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's aura vanished without a trace.

Immediately afterward, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's voice addressed Zhang Yu and Greenwood directly: "You two, come inside."

Meanwhile, as the academies released official announcements, the Spirit Realm erupted into another wave of fervent discussion.

Zhang Yu, reading the news, thought to himself, "The Ten Universities are jointly establishing the Spatial Technology Research Association? With Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole as its president and unlimited funding from all ten universities? This is unprecedented."

Magnetic Pole, seeing Zhang Yu and Divine Monarch Greenwood arrive, remarked, "I've reached an agreement with the principals of all ten universities to jointly fund the establishment of the Research Association. We'll build laboratories and conduct in-depth research and exploration of Spatial Technology."

Turning to Zhang Yu, she added, "Zhang Yu, you'll also join the Research Association and lead your own experimental group. From now on, all research expenses will be jointly covered by the Ten Universities."

Zhang Yu wasn't surprised by this. It was the outcome of his earlier discussions with Magnetic Pole after she received the blueprints.

He smiled and agreed, knowing that with the Research Association and the financial support of the Ten Universities, his future cultivation and research would have ample resources to draw upon.

Moreover, under the guidance of the Research Association, the industrial chains of all ten universities would undergo significant transformations.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "By leveraging the Research Association's influence to guide the universities' Spatial Technology efforts, I can secure vast resources for my cultivation."

"Moreover, the cultivation resources required for the Immortal Sect daoist arts technique, the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier, can also be obtained through this process."

"After all, many of the materials used in Spatial Technology are similar. By influencing product production through technological advancements, we can increase the overall societal output of these materials, making it easier for me to advance this Immortal Sect daoist arts technique..."

Zhang Yu understood that this was about using technological guidance to directly drive the upgrading of entire societal industrial chains, influencing company production, and shaping the research directions of the Ten Universities' Immortal Dao studies. By promoting the progress of the Ten Universities, he would simultaneously benefit his own cultivation.

The resulting efficiency gains would far surpass the benefits of solitary cultivation.

Furthermore, each advancement in Spatial Technology would have immeasurable impacts on various industries — transportation, logistics, shopping, and more — and on the work, lives, and studies of billions of people.

"The schools' textbooks will change, the curricula will change, and even the exam content will change, right?"

Zhang Yu mused inwardly, "And with the application of new Spatial Technology in transportation and logistics, the fundamental logic of many industries will be transformed."

"Take the transportation industry, for example. The design and form of Flying Boats will undergo massive changes. Countless shipbuilding companies will rise, while just as many will collapse, unable to keep up with the rapid evolution."

"And this is just one industry. In every sector, countless individuals will become immensely wealthy, while countless others will go bankrupt, ultimately reshaping the development of the Spirit Realm..."

At that moment, Zhang Yu seemed to foresee the tidal wave of societal transformation his technological advancements would unleash.

The spatial technology derived from Kunlun in the Palm was like a domino effect. Once Zhang Yu pushed down the first domino, it would set off a chain reaction, propelling society toward a future even he couldn't fully predict.

Of course, for the Research Association to maintain its leadership among the Ten Universities and continue guiding production through technology, it needed to secure a decisive advantage in spatial technology.

Zhang Yu felt utterly confident in this regard.

He thought to himself, "The spatial knowledge contained within the Level 40 Kunlun in the Palm, combined with the two great Dao Seeds — the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology and the Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart — will ensure my research progresses at an astonishing pace."

"If I can successfully cultivate the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier next, my advantage will only grow, potentially allowing me to dominate the battlefield."

Several days later, Bei Wufeng arrived at a large building on the northern side of the Grand Void. He saw the sign for the Spatial Technology Research Institute being hung up, surrounded by dust and smoke as construction crews worked feverishly.

Yu Xinghan, standing beside him, explained, "This entire area will eventually become part of the Spatial Technology Park."

He pointed eastward. "From East Lake District to Central Street, there are eight planned phases. The final area will exceed one million square meters, personally overseen by Divine Monarch Greenwood."

As Bei Wufeng surveyed the scene, his heart surged with excitement. He thought to himself, "Spatial technology is indeed the next frontier. The next century will likely be the century of spatial technology."

Knowing he had the opportunity to join the institute, Bei Wufeng's excitement grew even stronger. He resolved to throw himself into the work, determined to secure his place in the coming technological revolution.

After Yu Xinghan escorted him into the building, Bei Wufeng arrived outside the designated conference room and paused in surprise.

"Yan Qianji? Jin Jun?"

As he recognized familiar faces from the Artifact Refinement Department, Bei Wufeng thought to himself, "Have they poached all the elite talents from Myriad Laws University's Artifact Refinement Department?"

"Still, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole is our principal at Myriad Laws. It's only natural she'd prioritize our students."

However, when Bei Wufeng entered the interview room, he was taken aback. The projection before him wasn't Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, but Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu looked at Bei Wufeng and smiled faintly. "Why do you want to join the Spatial Technology Research Institute?"

Bei Wufeng's expression turned serious. "I believe spatial technology holds immense potential for the future. It will guide the development of the Ten Universities and determine the course of war. As I strive to become the most exceptional cultivator and continue my pursuit of the Immortal Dao, it's only natural to choose this most promising field."

---

After finishing his interview, Bei Wufeng asked Zhang Yu before leaving, "Excuse me... if I pass the interview and join the Spatial Technology Research Institute, will I be working under the guidance of Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole?"

Zhang Yu replied calmly, "Teacher Magnetic Pole has her own research group. If you join the Research Association, you'll be working in my experimental group."

A flicker of disappointment crossed Bei Wufeng's face.

If he had a choice, Bei Wufeng would naturally have preferred to join Magnetic Pole's team to study Spatial Technology. In his eyes, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole was the foremost Soul Transformation expert among the Ten Universities, a pioneer and leader in Spatial Technology, representing the most advanced direction of technological development.

In comparison, Zhang Yu's aura seemed much weaker. Although his Immortal Sect Technique guaranteed exceptional future potential, his time for growth was still far too short...

Bei Wufeng wasn't alone in this sentiment. Yan Qianji, Jin Jun, and other Artifact Refinement Department prodigies also felt a pang of disappointment when they learned that the interview was for Zhang Yu's group, not Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's.

Yan Qianji thought to himself, "Zhang Yu has only recently entered the Nascent Soul Realm. He'll likely spend most of his time consolidating his cultivation and nurturing his Nascent Soul. How much time will he have left for research?"

After a moment's contemplation, Yan Qianji declined. "I'm sorry, True Monarch Blazing Light, but I still want to try my chances with Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole."

On the other side, Bei Wufeng hesitated before deciding to wait for the opportunity Zhang Yu would offer. He thought to himself, "At least I'll join the Spatial Technology Research Association first. Once I'm in... maybe I can find a way to transfer to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's group?"

Jin Jun, Zhang Yu's former rival in the competition for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, now had a much simpler plan.

Jin Jun thought, "Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole brought Zhang Yu in to clearly use the Research Association's resources to boost his cultivation."

He knew his own abilities. While decent among students, they were utterly inadequate for Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's group.

"But while I can't latch onto Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's coattails, Zhang Yu can."

"If Zhang Yu latches onto Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's coattails, and I latch onto Zhang Yu's, wouldn't that mean I've also latched onto Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's coattails?"

With this thought, Jin Jun resolved to join Zhang Yu's research team.

After interviewing each candidate, Zhang Yu paid no attention to their inner thoughts.

Hiding behind Magnetic Pole significantly reduced the pressure on him, but it also diminished his aura, making it much harder to attract talent.

However, he believed that with the reputation of the Spatial Technology Research Institute, recruiting Golden Core Cultivators to join his experimental team would be relatively easy.

Moreover, Zhang Yu wasn't seeking research assistants; he simply needed help with his cultivation.

In his view, advancing his cultivation, especially improving his Immortal Sect daoist arts, was key to producing more research breakthroughs and developing the future strength needed to withstand greater pressure.

"Recruiting Golden Core Cultivators won't be difficult, but Nascent Soul Cultivators..." Zhang Yu mused inwardly. "Attracting a seasoned Artifact Refinement Nascent Soul to assist me in refining magical artifacts... that might be a challenge."

"After all, such cultivators typically have their own companies, laboratories, and factories, with more projects and research topics than they can handle. Convincing them to serve under a newly advanced Nascent Soul Cultivator like me... my current reputation and aura aren't strong enough."

"Even with the Spatial Technology Research Institute's prestige, it still might not be enough."

"They'll worry about wasting their time and stagnating here..."

Zhang Yu wasn't overly anxious or worried. He believed that as he gradually achieved results, Nascent Soul Cultivators would apply for positions.

At that moment, as Bei Wufeng, Yan Qianji, Jin Jun, and other Heavenly Chosen students from the Artifact Refinement Department completed their interviews with Zhang Yu, today's interview process came to a complete end.

Just then, Ye Xingli sent Zhang Yu a message: Junior Brother, I'm going to fully dedicate myself to Teacher's project now. It's time I returned your company to you.

Zhang Yu knew that his senior sister had joined Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's experimental team at the Research Association, participating in spatial technology research.

He believed that with Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's capabilities, significant breakthroughs were inevitable, and Ye Xingli would undoubtedly benefit greatly.

Zhang Yu said, "President Fortune, please coordinate with Senior Sister."

During his five-month seclusion, Zhang Yu's original company had undergone multiple expansions, now employing over 200 people.

Lady Fortune, the original shareholder, had taken over management shortly after, but the sheer volume of information overwhelmed her.

After entrusting the company's administration to Lady Fortune, Zhang Yu returned to his cultivation.

Magic Power and vital energy surged through his body as he practiced a breathing technique to enhance his Magic Power.

His next goal was to upgrade the Passive Breathing Technique to level 40, allowing him to passively cultivate Magic Power at maximum efficiency every day.

After mastering this breathing technique, his next objective was to advance each of his cultivation arts to level 40, completing the creation of the Chain Formation Diagram for the Nascent Soul Sacred Body.

"After all, the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier Immortal Sect daoist art is vastly different from Kunlun in the Palm. It requires far more time and resources. With the Nascent Soul Sacred Body, my cultivation will be much more efficient, saving me significant time and resources."

In addition to these pursuits, Zhang Yu's Nascent Soul could be seen hovering behind him, silently practicing its cultivation method.

"A key aspect of the Nascent Soul Realm is continuously nourishing the Nascent Soul. Through cultivation, I must constantly enhance its range, speed, and other attributes, preparing it for its eventual transformation into the Primordial Spirit."

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, connected to Zhang Yu's consciousness, was rapidly browsing vast amounts of learning materials, including textbooks and knowledge required for Artifact Refinement Department graduate students, as well as various artifact refinement design blueprints that Zhang Yu felt he could use.

Cultivating cultivation arts, studying knowledge, nourishing the Nascent Soul, managing his research team, remotely directing his company... time flowed relentlessly through Zhang Yu's incredibly full life.

---

Even as the Spatial Technology Research Association was established, the other Ten Great Universities did not completely abandon their research and exploration of spatial technology.

Heavenly Demon University.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus gazed at Kuang Tianqing before him and asked, "You've returned to being a man?"

Kuang Tianqing's eyelid twitched, and he thought to himself, "Damn it... What do these new Soul Transformation Experts want from me? Could they be like the old ones, trying to give me remedial lessons?"

The thought sent a wave of goosebumps across his body, and he felt an overwhelming urge to flee.

But Kuang Tianqing knew that with his current cultivation level, escaping from a Soul Transformation Expert was impossible.

"Damn it..." Kuang Tianqing mentally repeated, "Endure it. Endure this temporary humiliation..."

Just then, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus continued, "Since you've chosen to revert to being a man, it seems your memories have returned?"

Seeing Kuang Tianqing's surprised and bewildered expression, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus said calmly, "I recently reviewed my Master's diary and discovered that you possess considerable knowledge about the sect."

"A diary?" Kuang Tianqing cursed inwardly. "That old bastard Divine Monarch Unrestrained! Why did you have to write a diary? And put my secrets in it?!"

But a moment later, he realized, "Wait, how could Divine Monarch Unrestrained just randomly write a diary?"

"That brat Sinful Lotus... he probably didn't find a diary. He must have hacked into Divine Monarch Unrestrained's hidden database and extracted information about me."

As this thought took hold, Kuang Tianqing's mind raced, his thoughts churning even more furiously. "Why is he telling me all this? Does he want to expose my identity and 'correct' me, his Demonic Dao senior? Is he trying to squeeze more resources out of me?"

"Ah, these treacherous disciples who betray their ancestors... what wouldn't they do?"

Sighing, Kuang Tianqing decided to lay her cards on the table. "What do you want?" he asked bluntly.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus replied calmly, "I plan to establish a Spatial Technology Research Group, which I will lead personally, to catch up with Magnetic Pole."

Kuang Tianqing's eyes narrowed. He realized he had misjudged the situation.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus continued, "You must understand. Even if Magnetic Pole is willing to provide technical support, Spatial Technology is of paramount importance. It's not just about vast commercial interests; it will also form a crucial component of each university's future military strength, determining the course of wars. Such a thing... must be developed independently."

"And Heavenly Demon University, even if it cannot monopolize the technological direction, must at least become one of the leading forces."

"The sect memories you possess should greatly assist my research, wouldn't you agree?"

Hearing these words, Kuang Tianqing's heart stirred. He suddenly asked, "Zhang Yu... is he also in the Spatial Technology Research Association?"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus replied, "As far as I know, yes. However, he acquired the Immortal Sect Technique too recently. It's unlikely he'll achieve any significant breakthroughs in the short term."

"On the other hand, Magnetic Pole has managed to make an early breakthrough in Spatial Technology..."

"Perhaps Zhang Yu leaked some details of the Immortal Sect Technique to her."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus concluded, "That's why I need your assistance."

---

Netherworld University.

Wang Yin asked in surprise, "The university is also getting into spatial technology?"

Divine Monarch Nether Spring replied calmly, "Spatial technology is the future trend. The university can't rely solely on an outsider like Magnetic Pole."

"Moreover, the design blueprint she's publicly released has already broken the most difficult ground. With the combined strength and accumulated knowledge of the Soul Transformation experts at the various universities, they might even be able to catch up to her, or even surpass her."

"Magnetic Pole has merely taken the first step ahead of us. What follows will be a hundred flowers blooming, with all the universities competing together."

"Once you join the university's experimental group, remember to observe closely, listen attentively, and learn diligently. In the future, you might become a senior expert in this field."

Wang Yin nodded thoughtfully, then suddenly asked, "Is Zhang Yu now working under Magnetic Pole? Has he already... reached the Nascent Soul Realm?"

He recalled Zhang Yu's Daoist name posted on social media: "This guy's ambition is huge."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring confirmed, "Indeed. I checked his expenses at the Research Association — almost all of them are for consolidating his Nascent Soul cultivation. It seems Magnetic Pole is using him to spend the research funds."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring continued, "Wang Yin, put Zhang Yu's affairs aside for now. The most important thing now is researching spatial technology. You need to pay close attention to every article Magnetic Pole publishes, every product she releases, and every piece of intelligence about her. Understand?"

---

Immortal Armaments University.

Tian Shengong gazed at the design blueprint before him, his heart filled with admiration. "Is this the Spatial Magical Artifact designed by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole?"

"Magnificent! Truly magnificent!"

Ahead, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets declared, "You must thoroughly digest this blueprint within three days. Within a month, you must completely overhaul it, complete testing, and begin the production phase."

"From now on, you must monitor every piece of intelligence about Magnetic Pole. We must stay relentlessly on her heels, leveraging our late-mover advantage to devour, absorb, and assimilate everything she creates. We will cling to her like a shadow, then surpass her completely!"

"This is not just a victory for Immortal Armaments University, but for Extreme Tiger as well! It is the prelude to our future dominance in the spatial domain, where we will set the industry standards!"
