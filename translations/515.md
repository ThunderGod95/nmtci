# Chapter 515: Accept My Extreme Emotion Sword Dao

As a seven-colored light shimmered into existence, a hazy human figure slowly materialized within Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

A woman's voice then echoed in Zhang Yu's mind.

"Zhang Yu, we meet again."

Staring at the indistinct figure, Zhang Yu exclaimed in surprise, "You're... Divine Monarch Seven Emotions?"

He cursed inwardly, "Wen Wuya's actions have been discovered. Contacting A-Zhen will be even more difficult now."

"Has Divine Monarch Seven Emotions come to settle accounts with me?"

"But this is Myriad Laws University City..."

Zhang Yu's thoughts raced back to the earlier incident when Divine Monarch Jade Nectar had descended from the Spirit Realm to clash with Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations.

"Even if the Soul Transformation Divine Monarch isn't here in person, the aftermath of their battle could bankrupt me!"

"Should I immediately call True Monarch Magnetic Pole for help? Or seek assistance from the three Divine Monarchs at the university?"

"But that would completely sever my ties with Divine Monarch Seven Emotions. Maybe I should hear what she wants first?"

As Zhang Yu's mind churned with conflicting thoughts, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said calmly, "Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen often speaks of you."

"You've aspired to join Joyful Union University since high school, haven't you?"

Zhang Yu was momentarily at a loss for words, eventually managing only an awkward smile. "Back in high school, who really knows what major is best? Now, I just want to work hard in the Artifact Refinement Department and deeply cultivate the Great Dao of Artifact Refinement."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions neither affirmed nor denied Zhang Yu's response, simply stating coolly, "The Artifact Refinement Department is indeed more reliable than Civil Engineering. If you hadn't switched to Artifact Refinement, I wouldn't have bothered seeking you out today."

Just as Zhang Yu was secretly feeling proud of his Artifact Refinement Department affiliation, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions continued, "Because of your Artifact Refinement status, I'll offer you slightly better terms today."

"1,000 Spirit Coins."

"I'll give you 1,000 Spirit Coins..."

Zhang Yu's heart jolted with surprise, then sank with realization. Are they trying to pay me 1,000 Spirit Coins to leave Bai Zhenzhen? Hmph, they underestimate me. Even with 1,000 Spirit Coins, I'd never agree...

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' voice continued, "Within three days, you must travel to Heavenly Sword University, live and eat with Bai Zhenzhen, and practice swordsmanship with her daily. No matter what she does to you, you must not resist. Maintain this arrangement for three months."

As she spoke, the number 1000 Spirit Coins appeared in Zhang Yu's bionic eye, as if the money would be transferred to his account with a mere nod.

Zhang Yu's heart sank, feeling his resolve rapidly crumbling.

"1000 Spirit Coins for three months with A-Zhen... Is this just free money?"

Accept her! Accept her! Accept her!

Voices clamored in his mind, urging him to agree to Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' offer, but he barely managed to suppress them with reason.

"No, this is too strange."

"Even if Myriad Laws University approves my sudden three-month absence, and my teacher agrees... who knows what Divine Monarch Seven Emotions might do after I go to Heavenly Sword? I can't entrust my fate to her."

Recalling True Monarch Magnetic Pole's stories about the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao and the reports Director Gao had sent him about Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' disciples, Zhang Yu gradually calmed down, using logic to suppress his impulsive urges.

Sensing Zhang Yu's internal struggle and his subsequent composure, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said coolly, "It seems you're unwilling to abandon your achievements at Myriad Laws."

"Alright, I can offer another condition."

As she spoke, the patterns of light within Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye shifted once more, and a secret manual suddenly materialized.

The cover of the manual bore four large characters: Extreme Emotion Sword Dao.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions declared, "If you agree to cultivate the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao and advance it to Level 10 within three years, I won't interfere even if you establish a Dual Cultivation Department at Myriad Laws University, invite Divine Monarch Jade Nectar for dual cultivation, or even engage in triple cultivation with Bai Zhenzhen. I won't meddle in any of it."

Zhang Yu paused, staring at the words "Extreme Emotion Sword Dao" on the manual's cover. His mind flooded with news reports of spouses killing each other, children murdering their parents, and entire families being slaughtered.

He thought to himself, "If I cultivate this manual, will it turn me into a homicidal maniac? That would be a surefire way to go bankrupt!"

"No, it's worse than bankruptcy. It would mean killing my own people!"

He mused, "With my skills, if I truly went on a killing spree... how many people I know could stop me?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions asked, "What? Are you unwilling?"

Zhang Yu replied slowly, "I don't have the certification."

"I only have a Military Civil Engineering Certificate. That wouldn't qualify me to register the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, would it?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said calmly, "You've been secretly cultivating my Extreme Emotion Sword Dao. No one reported you, so what does it matter if you lack certification? If you can reach level 10, I'll arrange for you to take a supplementary exam and get certified."

Zhang Yu's reluctance only grew. The crime of practicing cultivation arts without certification was too severe; he couldn't bear the consequences. Moreover, the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao seemed prone to losing control, making exposure highly likely.

Just then, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions snorted coldly. "You refuse this, reject that, and keep making excuses... You have no choice."

"Take the sword!"

Zhang Yu blinked in surprise. In the next instant, the manual that had appeared in his Bionic Eye suddenly flipped open. Page after page of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao's cultivation methods flashed before his eyes, instantly imprinting themselves deep within his mind.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions smiled. "I've already taught you the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao. With your martial dao aptitude, you'll quickly master its sword techniques. There's no escape now; you're destined to walk this path."

"Just like human emotions, they naturally take root and sprout in the heart. You can't kill them all, you can't extinguish them completely."

"The Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is like those emotions. It will gradually grow and spread within you, beyond your control."

Zhang Yu glanced at his Feather Book, carefully examining the page where cultivation arts were recorded. He searched repeatedly, but found no trace of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao.

He wondered inwardly, "If what Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said is true, and that was indeed the secret manual of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, then I've already read it completely. Why hasn't the Feather Book recorded it? Could it be...?"

At the same moment, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions continued with a smile, "Zhang Yu, the world claims my Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is a Demonic Path sword art, contrary to worldly ethics and unacceptable to society."

"But only I know that my Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is the true Righteous Path sword art. It's just that Kunxu has been corrupted by demons."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Whether your Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is righteous or demonic aside... judging by the Feather Book's reaction, this Extreme Emotion Sword Dao isn't complete, is it?"

He had encountered situations before where viewing a cultivation art failed to register in the Feather Book.

Based on his years of experience with the Feather Book, the most common reason for this was that the cultivation art he had seen was incomplete.

"Is the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao practiced by Divine Monarch Seven Emotions incomplete?"

"Or did she deliberately transmit an incomplete version to me?"

Zhang Yu dared not voice his doubts. He had no evidence to support his suspicions, and if Divine Monarch Seven Emotions had deliberately withheld the complete sword technique, exposing her would only bring trouble upon himself.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions continued, "Now that you've learned the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, I won't sever your connection with Bai Zhenzhen again."

"In fact, not only will I not sever it, but you must now communicate with Bai Zhenzhen for at least half an hour every day. Do you understand?"

Zhang Yu: "Huh?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions: "One missed day will result in a warning. Three missed days in a month, and I'll expose your cultivation of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"Trust me, having 'cultivated the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao' on your resume would be disastrous for many, especially in the Artifact Refining World."

"You wouldn't want your teacher, True Monarch Magnetic Pole, to discover you've been secretly cultivating the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, would you?"

Zhang Yu couldn't help but inwardly curse, "Damn it... You're using this as blackmail, yet you still have the nerve to call the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao the Righteous Path?"

In the next moment, a flash of light revealed Bai Zhenzhen's image on the screen.

This time, it wasn't a recording but a real-time projection across the Spirit Realm.

Bai Zhenzhen stared at Zhang Yu on the other side of the screen, her voice urgent. "Yu Zi, have you cultivated the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions chuckled softly. "He has already completed his training. I have personally imparted the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao to him."

Bai Zhenzhen broke out in a cold sweat, her face etched with worry as she fixed her gaze on Zhang Yu. "Yu Zi, is it true? Did you really learn it?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions laughed. "I've reviewed Zhang Yu's records. With his innate talent in martial dao, he has likely already mastered the first level of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"Zhang Yu, how do you feel now? How do you feel?"

"Is something surging within your heart? Do you feel an overwhelming urge to rush to Heavenly Sword University? Is sword qi stirring restlessly within your body?"

Under Bai Zhenzhen's concerned gaze and Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' bewitching words, Zhang Yu felt too embarrassed to admit he hadn't mastered the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao.

Though fleeting glimpses of sword techniques and stances had flashed before his eyes since the beginning, Zhang Yu had failed to grasp their essence.

After all, Zhang Yu had three principles he never violated: he would not cultivate incomplete cultivation arts, those that could not be inspected by the Feather Book, or those incompatible with the Feather Book's specialized cultivation arts.

Cultivation arts like the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao were precisely the kind he disdained to cultivate.

Bai Zhenzhen bit her cherry-red lip, her voice tinged with resentment. "Yu Zi, it's my fault. I'm the one who led you down this Extreme Emotion Demonic Path."

Crimson sword qi erupted from her body, and sword light swirled in her eyes. "Don't worry," she vowed. "I'll accelerate my cultivation of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao. When the time comes, I'll personally help you abolish your Extreme Emotion Sword Dao cultivation."

Remembering Zhang Yu's willingness to risk everything to exchange Spiritual Roots with her, Bai Zhenzhen gritted her teeth. "From now on, we should avoid contact for a while. I'm afraid that if we meet too often, my Extreme Emotion Sword Dao cultivation will advance too quickly..."

"Absolutely not," Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said coldly. "Not only must you not cease contact, but you must meet daily in the Spirit Realm."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' sinister laughter echoed between them.

"Exactly! Not only will you meet, but I'll also create a private space for you two in the Spirit Realm! You'll be entwined day and night! Whispering sweet nothings! Inseparable! Clinging like glue! Hahahahahaha..."
