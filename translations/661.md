# Chapter 661: New World

True Person Starfire said, "The spatial structure of Kunxu was designed and crafted by Immortals."

"All technologies that utilize and modify spatial structures are collectively referred to as Spatial Technology."

"If the Lower Realms, from the first to tenth layers, were to master Spatial Technology, they would usher in a new era of massive infrastructure development, leading to a healthier economic landscape."

"The production efficiency of all industries would experience a quantum leap, generating even greater profits for the sects."

"Such a choice should be tolerable to them."

True Person Starfire cautioned, "But remember this: you may choose cultivation arts that contain Spatial Technology, but never select those with excessively profound spatial techniques."

"Specifically, avoid arts that involve creating, severing, or piercing spatial structures. Never choose such techniques."

Zhang Yu's gaze flickered slightly, his mind already recalling information about the Immortal Descendants. He asked, "Why?"

True Person Starfire explained, "Altering spatial structures would have too great an impact on Kunxu, and it's something the Immortals would never permit. If you were to choose an Immortal Sect Technique with similar capabilities..."

True Person Starfire chuckled bitterly. "The best outcome might be that you never master this cultivation art in your lifetime."

"Remember this: any influence on space must be simple, as simple as possible. Bending or folding space is already the absolute limit."

After sharing this information, True Person Starfire added, "I've given you my advice, but the final decision rests with you."

"Keep in mind that even if you choose a Space-Tech cultivation art, you'll still face the combined pressure of the ten academies and the overwhelming power of Soul Transformation cultivators. These challenges are unavoidable."

"There's no cultivation art in this world that can solve all your problems in one fell swoop."

After his conversation with True Person Starfire, Zhang Yu's mind swirled with information.

"Space?" Zhang Yu mused inwardly. "Could that be a better choice?"

"But what kind of cultivation art specifically?"

"Will I only find out after the award ceremony, when I can access the Dao Repository Catalog?"

Zhang Yu sank into deep thought. "Should I choose... space?"

Seven hours remained until the awards ceremony.

Kuang Tianqing awoke in a spare physical body.

Feeling the weakness of this vessel, a flicker of disgust crossed her eyes.

But what truly tormented her came from within her mind.

After dying and becoming a Soul Cultivator in the Spirit Realm, long-sealed memories surged forth relentlessly.

These ancient memories had completely reshaped Kuang Tianqing's personality and beliefs, filling her with unease about her current situation.

Yet they also revealed the true purpose behind her participation in the Ten Greats League.

"I'm here to promote the New Reincarnation Technology," she murmured, rubbing her temples. "To think I lost to Zhang Yu... Who exactly is backing him?"

Activating a private communication channel, she soon heard a familiar laugh.

Recognizing the voice, Kuang Tianqing said, "Son..."

The other party replied, "Hmm?"

Kuang Tianqing paused, as if struck by a sudden realization, and sighed helplessly. "Father."

The other party chuckled in satisfaction. "That's more like it. Might makes right — the strong are fathers, the weak are sons. Remembering this means your memories have returned. What do you need me for?"

Kuang Tianqing said, "I failed. What do we do now?"

The other party replied calmly, "I'm already aware of the situation. Don't worry about it."

Kuang Tianqing was taken aback. "Don't worry about it? We've poured so many resources into promoting the New Reincarnation System. Just abandon it? If Zhang Yu chooses the Dharma Realm..."

The other party said, "Dao Qiankun is one of us."

Kuang Tianqing's eyes widened, a flicker of surprise crossing her face.

The other party continued, "Zhang Yu is also one of us. He will choose the New Reincarnation."

Kuang Tianqing was even more astonished. "How could I not know this?"

The other party chuckled softly. "Now you do. This time, we will declare to every living person in the world: Reincarnation exists."

Four hours remained until the award ceremony.

Inside the Flying Boat, Zhang Yu looked at Zhang Pianpian with surprise. "Senior Sister, what are you doing back here?"

A moment later, his eyes widened in astonishment. "You've reached the Golden Core stage?"

Zhang Pianpian nodded. "It's just the Golden Core. Compared to the chaos you stirred up on the Second Layer, it's nothing."

"Now countless people are investigating me, trying to get me to persuade you to choose an Immortal Sect Technique."

Zhang Yu sighed, a wry smile crossing his face.

Zhang Pianpian continued, "I previously suggested the Nine Heavens Reincarnation Steps. What are your thoughts on it now?"

Zhang Yu asked, "Can the Nine Heavens Reincarnation Steps protect my friends?"

Zhang Pianpian shook her head. "It's hard to say, but it's definitely the safest cultivation art for you."

After a moment of silence, Zhang Yu said, "Many people trust me. Many are relying on me to survive. Many have staked their lives and fortunes on me."

"A-Zhen, Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan... so many people. I want to protect them all, if possible."

Zhang Pianpian looked at Zhang Yu with a sigh. "The path of the Immortal Dao... isn't meant to be walked this way."

But sensing Zhang Yu's gaze, Zhang Pianpian only perceived a resolute determination, the same unwavering resolve he had shown when helping her and Bai Zhenzhen in the past.

Unconsciously, her younger brother had taken on more and more responsibilities, the weight on his shoulders growing heavier with each passing day.

Zhang Pianpian disapproved of Zhang Yu's choices, fearing that one day he would be crushed by the burden.

Yet at this moment, seeing the unwavering determination in his eyes, Zhang Pianpian felt as if she were seeing the same brother who had stayed on the First Layer to accompany Bai Zhenzhen until she passed the Foundation Establishment exam.

Zhang Pianpian knew then that Zhang Yu's mind was made up.

Zhang Yu said, "Master Xinghuo told me I could choose a cultivation art that incorporates Space-Tech."

"A new era of grand infrastructure projects?" Zhang Pianpian sighed. "It's a desperate measure, but it's just drinking poison to quench your thirst. Are you sure you want to pursue this path?"

A hint of confusion flickered in Zhang Yu's eyes. "Senior Sister, what do you think?"

Zhang Pianpian looked at Zhang Yu. "My only advice is the Nine Heavens Reincarnation Steps. Preserving yourself is the most crucial thing on the path of the Immortal Dao."

"However... to prevent you from making a rash choice later, I can help you research which cultivation arts contain Space-Tech."

"But I also have a suggestion... Among these arts, choose one you can cultivate to completion the fastest."

"I remember you're quite skilled in martial arts, right? The Nine Heavens Reincarnation Steps is a martial art."

Zhang Yu's eyes flickered as he thought, "Immortal Sect Techniques are also divided into martial arts and daoist arts. Daoist arts require various resources for cultivation, while martial arts can be practiced directly."

He mused, "Does Sister want me to cultivate the art as quickly as possible after obtaining it? If I choose a martial art, I might even master it on the spot?"

Zhang Pianpian said meaningfully, "I know you have a talent for martial arts. Although all these arts involve Spatial Technology, which one can you cultivate faster? Let me see if I can find it for you in advance."

After a moment's thought, Zhang Yu replied, "The fewer the moves a martial art has, the faster I can master it."

Zhang Pianpian nodded and turned to leave. "I understand. I'll let you know before the award ceremony."

---

Two hours before the award ceremony.

Countless streams of data flashed through Nine Heavens Liu's eyes, representing the flow of vast sums of capital and the shifting values of assets.

Ever since Zhang Yu's victory, Nine Heavens Liu had been plunged into relentless activity.

This unexpected outcome had disrupted many people's plans and upended the Finance Department's carefully laid arrangements.

As a result, Nine Heavens Liu and his colleagues had been forced to engage in frantic negotiations and make emergency investments across the board, hoping to secure sufficient profits regardless of which Immortal Sect Technique Zhang Yu ultimately chose.

He knew that the Kunlun Society, with its eight Soul Transformation cultivators from the Finance Department, was also fully mobilized. These eight cultivators were traveling between the Ten Great Universities, constantly influencing the institutions' decisions.

What puzzled Nine Heavens Liu was that while actions, negotiations, and meetings were proceeding at a feverish pace, many funds remained unaccounted for.

He couldn't help but recall the massive sums of money that had mysteriously vanished from the Finance Department's accounts before the Ten Greats League began.

"Where did all that money go?"

"What exactly are the Soul Transformation cultivators preparing for?"

Just then, a meeting invitation appeared before Nine Heavens Liu.

But when his consciousness crossed the Spirit Realm and followed the invitation's path, he found himself in an unfamiliar place.

At the same time, a large crowd of teachers and students stood around them. Nine Heavens Liu recognized these individuals as the elite members of the Finance Departments from the Ten Great Universities.

Just as everyone was filled with confusion, bewilderment, and tension, a colossal figure materialized before them.

"This place is called the Dark Spirit Realm."

Nine Heavens Liu looked up and saw that the speaker was none other than his Master, Divine Monarch Golden Citadel of the Finance Department at Myriad Laws University.

"For the sake of Kunxu's overall interests, the Kunlun Society has always been committed to maintaining peace, preventing wars, and resolving conflicts between Soul Transformation cultivators."

"But now, whether it's the Soul Transformation cultivators from the various universities or the Upper Sects, their pursuit of profit has grown increasingly greedy, and their exploitation of the Kunlun Society and the Finance Department has become increasingly unscrupulous."

"Yet today, an unprecedented opportunity has presented itself to us."

"The gates to a new world have been opened before us, and unprecedented profits are now within our grasp..."

In the next moment, Nine Heavens Liu saw seven more Soul Transformation figures materialize in succession, followed by a series of Evil God figures and three additional Soul Transformation cultivators with unfamiliar auras.

Though their auras were unfamiliar, Nine Heavens Liu immediately recognized two of them: the Unemployed Elder and the Ascension Child, who had previously attacked University City.

"What are they planning?"

As Nine Heavens Liu watched this scene unfold, his heart raced. He felt like a small fish being swept forward by the great flood of history, with no idea where it would be carried.
