# Chapter 751: The Righteous Gods' Aid, Formless Martial Art (6/6)

Watching Yun Zhiguang's actions, Zhang Yu immediately shouted, "Principal! Stop! If you keep acting so recklessly, I'll call the Righteous Gods!"

Streams of divine light erupted from behind Yun Zhiguang, pinning Zhang Yu firmly to the ground. Her beautiful, classical face was frosted with coldness. While calibrating her movements and coordinates, she sneered, "Go ahead and try. Even if you scream your lungs out, you won't stop me."

As Zhang Yu sent his message through the Spirit Realm, several Righteous Gods quickly descended upon the scene. Among them was Deng Bingding, an old acquaintance of Zhang Yu's.

Seeing the situation, the Righteous Gods showed varied expressions, but none of them took any action.

Zhang Yu cried out urgently, "Sirs! Yun Zhiguang has gone mad! She's trying to force me into Compulsory Dual Cultivation! Please stop her immediately!"

The Righteous Gods remained unmoved. Deng Bingding explained to Zhang Yu, "Her actions are currently legal. We cannot intervene."

"Legal?" Zhang Yu was stunned. "This is fucking legal?"

Deng Bingding continued to explain, "Yun Zhiguang possesses a Compulsory Dual Cultivation License. She has an annual quota for it. Theoretically... as long as she pays the fee, doesn't harm the other party, and doesn't seize the opportunity to steal their seed, she can force anyone she chooses into Compulsory Dual Cultivation."

"Hehehehehe."

Amidst a delicate laugh, a projection of her license materialized above Yun Zhiguang's head.

Staring at the three large characters for "Compulsory Dual Cultivation License," even Zhang Yu, who had experienced countless bizarre things in Kunxu, was left speechless.

Yun Zhiguang's voice rang out with a laugh. "Cultivate first, report later — a special privilege granted by the Heavenly Court. This is my right. Today, whether you're willing or not, I'm claiming you."

Zhang Yu roared in fury and struggled violently.

The Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power within him surged wildly, while his Immortal Sect Technique, Kunlun in the Palm, generated layers of spatial distortion.

But seeing this, a nearby Righteous God warned, "Stop at once, True Monarch Blazing Light! Yun Zhiguang has a Compulsory Dual Cultivation License. Her forcing you is a legal and compliant act. However, if you resist with force and attack her, it will be considered intentional assault — an illegal act — and we will be obligated to stop you."

"Seeing this part, I want to say something, but... I'm completely at a loss."

Deng Bingding also warned him, "Don't use force. You're at a critical moment in the Sect Examination. If you get entangled in a lawsuit, all your previous efforts will be wasted."

"Holy shit..." Zhang Yu cursed inwardly. "This is too corrupt! The heavens of Kunxu are utterly corrupt! How can a license like this even exist? Where the hell do you even get one? How do you pass the test for it?"

At this moment, Zhang Yu finally understood. From the Righteous Gods' perspective... being subjected to Compulsory Dual Cultivation by Yun Zhiguang was no big deal. It wouldn't affect his examination, so why not just let it happen?

"They probably even think that since I've already adopted a sect mindset, I shouldn't object to Compulsory Dual Cultivation at all."

But Zhang Yu refused. This was a bottom line he fiercely guarded — one of the things that distinguished him from the countless Kunxu University Students and Sect Scions. It was the anchor preventing him from being completely assimilated by Kunxu.

As he felt her curvaceous body press against him, Zhang Yu screamed in his mind, "No! How can I fall here? No, wait... how can I get it up here?"

Although only an instant had passed between Yun Zhiguang's arrival and Zhang Yu being pinned to the ground, his mind was racing, desperately searching for a way out of this predicament.

"I wonder how Kuang Tianqing faced those eight Soul Transformation cultivators back then? Should I ask him?"

Meanwhile, Yun Zhiguang watched Zhang Yu's constant struggling and resistance, a strange glint flashing in her eyes. "There's definitely something fishy here," she thought.

"He's resisting this fiercely over a mere Compulsory Dual Cultivation. With such a mindset, how could he have possibly passed the preliminary examination and entered a sect?"

"If he truly possessed a sect mindset and perspective, he wouldn't be refusing me at all. He should be cooperating."

"For him to pass the preliminary examination under these circumstances... the Heavenly Court must be secretly helping him."

With this realization, Yun Zhiguang resolved to deal with Zhang Yu thoroughly today.

At the same time, Le Mulan, who had been observing from the sidelines, sent a message to Zhang Yu.

In fact, ever since the re-examination ended, Le Mulan had often trained and studied with Zhang Yu. So when Yun Zhiguang arrived, she had been watching the entire scene unfold with both shock and careful attention.

As she observed carefully, a question arose in Le Mulan's mind.

"Yun Zhiguang... why is she forcing a Compulsory Dual Cultivation on Zhang Yu? What's her goal?"

Le Mulan vaguely sensed that this question held significant importance for the current situation.

And when Zhang Yu saw Le Mulan's message, a flash of insight struck him: "That's right, Yun Zhiguang's goal..."

"According to sect principles, I shouldn't be afraid of her Compulsory Dual Cultivation."

"Does she know my bottom line? Or that I've sealed my Sect Examination Memories? Or is she convinced I lack a sect mindset?"

Zhang Yu dismissed these possibilities one by one. The scene of his first meeting with Yun Zhiguang flashed through his mind.

"Extreme Emotion Sword Dao!" The thought suddenly struck him. "I told her I cultivate the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao! Could that be why she's testing me? Trying to break my Extreme Emotion Sword Dao? To make me suffer a backlash and perform poorly in the interview?"

"I must do the opposite. I have to make her understand that dual cultivation won't harm me — it will help me!"

At that moment, a flicker of understanding illuminated Zhang Yu's mind. He already had a countermeasure.

He thought to himself, "In that case, I can't back down. Instead, I must... charge forward fiercely!"

The next moment, Zhang Yu released his Sect Examination Clone. Fierce Study Qi instantly erupted from his body, making him seem like a completely different person.

"Hmm?" Yun Zhiguang's heart skipped a beat. She could already sense the change in Zhang Yu below.

In her eyes, Zhang Yu's gaze seemed panicked, but it was merely a disguise. The overwhelming lust hidden within startled even her.

"Come on, come on!" At that moment, the Sect Examination Clone roared inwardly. "Dual cultivation? I've been studying for the Sect Examination for so many years, spending countless nights alone with only a lamp for company, my frustration and desires bottled up. How could I not want to dual cultivate? I want to climb the peak of the Immortal Dao, to reach the highest echelons of the sect. How could I not want to cultivate with a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch?"

"Yun Zhiguang! You want to use this to trigger a backlash in me? Little do you know, I'm going to use you to aid my cultivation!"

Yun Zhiguang sensed that although Zhang Yu was desperately suppressing his vital energy and Magic Power, they were still slowly converging toward his lower abdomen.

More importantly, she could feel his entire body poised and ready for cultivation. How could this possibly be the reaction of someone unwilling to dual cultivate?

"Did this kid lie to me? If he truly practices the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, how could he react like this?"

"Or... has he already cultivated the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao to the Sect Devotee Realm, enabling him to dual cultivate for the sect? Was everything before just an act? Does he actually want to dual cultivate with me to gain benefits?"

As this thought crossed her mind, a sharp glint flashed in Yun Zhiguang's eyes.

She knew that the Sect Devotee Realm was a recent addition to the Heavenly Sword Sect's Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, updated only a few years ago. The new teachings hadn't even been transmitted to the Lower Realm yet.

"If Zhang Yu truly possesses this ability, the Heavenly Court must be secretly aiding him."

With this realization, Yun Zhiguang abruptly stopped her actions. She looked at Zhang Yu, who appeared unwilling, yet filled with longing — even seeming ready to lunge forward and pursue her. She let out a soft chuckle and retreated.

The Righteous Gods watching from the side understood the situation instantly.

Deng Bingding thought to herself, "So that's how it is. The True Monarch was just feigning compliance, pretending to be unwilling to dual cultivate. He even called us here to help lure her into his trap. A pity Yun Zhiguang saw through it."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's true self breathed a sigh of relief. He knew he had narrowly escaped a tiger's jaws, avoiding the tragic fate of being targeted for Compulsory Dual Cultivation.

Zhang Yu once again sealed his Sect Examination Clone, taking back full control of his body.

At the same time, Yu Xinghan burst into the room, shouting, "Let Zhang Yu go! If you have a problem, deal with me!"

After the re-examination, not only Le Mulan but also Yu Xinghan and Bai Zhenzhen had been staying close to Zhang Yu. They were looking out for each other to prevent any mishaps before the final interview.

As Yu Xinghan arrived, he sent Zhang Yu a mental message: "Don't worry, I covered for you. Bai Zhenzhen doesn't know what's happening here."

Zhang Yu replied: "Good brother."

Yun Zhiguang glanced coolly at the newcomers but had no intention of resorting to Compulsory Dual Cultivation again. After confirming it was ineffective against Zhang Yu, what would be the point? It would just be giving him a free benefit while wasting a Compulsory Dual Cultivation License slot.

"Since he's thinking like a sect member, let's handle this the sect's way."

With a thought, Yun Zhiguang sent several documents flying toward the three present: three contracts, one each for Zhang Yu, Yu Xinghan, and Le Mulan.

As Yu Xinghan's eyes scanned the contract's contents, he was stunned to realize it was an outsourcing agreement.

According to the contract, not only would they be offered jobs on the Eleventh Layer, but they would also be sponsored to take the Sect Staff Selection Examination. They would be provided with the best possible conditions to participate in the Sect Examination until they were accepted, and upon entering the sect, they would receive various rewards.

In short, it was a path to join the Eleventh Layer, enter the Myriad Laws Sect, ride the Promotion Accelerator, and ascend to the peak of the Immortal Dao.

As Yun Zhiguang sent out the contracts, the Righteous Gods nearby sprang into action. Deng Bingding spoke up, "Yun Zhiguang, please do not interfere with the candidates."

Yun Zhiguang smiled faintly. "I'm merely offering them an outsourcing contract, a new opportunity. I'm not preventing them from taking the Sect Examination. How is that interference?"

As she spoke, Yun Zhiguang began to retreat, adding, "Zhang Yu, Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan, you're all intelligent people. You should understand the situation with this Sect Examination."

Her tone carried a warning. "Your interviews this time will likely be extremely difficult. It's possible that your positions will be filled by others."

"On the other hand, if you stay on the Eleventh Layer, with my help, you'll have countless opportunities to take the Sect Examination..."

With a soft chuckle, Yun Zhiguang vanished from sight.

Deng Bingding then turned to Zhang Yu, Yu Xinghan, and Le Mulan. "Please rest assured, you three. The Heavenly Court will guarantee the upcoming Sect Examination Interview is fair and impartial. With your abilities, you're certain to pass."

"Yun Zhiguang is just a cornered dog lashing out, a desperate patient trying any cure. Don't pay her nonsense any mind."

"In fact, those sect disciples are already mobilizing their forces, trying to find evidence of you cheating. They want to expose some scandal at this critical moment."

Yu Xinghan exclaimed in shock, "Evidence of cheating?"

Deng Bingding smiled. "Rest assured, you three. You didn't cheat, so how could there be any evidence? Yun Zhiguang and her allies' efforts are doomed to fail."

"As for any other underhanded tactics, we will block them for you. All you need to do is focus your energy and prepare for the interview."

Zhang Yu, however, couldn't simply dismiss it. He believed Yun Zhiguang was right about one thing: the upcoming interview would be anything but simple.

The Conservative Faction within the sect would undoubtedly do everything in their power to prevent them from passing.

Although the Heavenly Court would support them from behind the scenes, the subtle power struggle between the two forces would inevitably affect them.

"I must seize this time to continue studying and cultivating, to become stronger so I can face the challenges ahead."

As for the so-called outsourcing contract, Zhang Yu didn't even give it a second thought. For now, Yun Zhiguang and the other sect disciples had to accommodate them due to the current situation.

But once they reached the Higher Ups, the sect would no longer need anything from them. Heaven only knew how they would be treated then.

Accepting the contract would mean entrusting his entire fate and future to others — a choice Zhang Yu was unwilling to make.

He wouldn't wait for next year. He was determined to enter the sect this year, in this very session.

So, in the days that followed, Zhang Yu once again devoted himself entirely to studying and cultivating.

The ten martial arts of the "Formless Martial Art" became his daily mandatory practice.

This was not only because Zhang Yu sensed the profound depth of these ten martial arts, but also because of a reminder from Deng Bingding.

"True Monarch Blazing Light, questions in the re-examination often carry deep meaning and are closely linked to the job positions you're applying for. It's worth spending extra effort to study them."

Zhang Yu sensed that Deng Bingding's words were a hint. He decided to switch his Feather Book's specialized martial art daily, aiming to raise all ten martial arts of the "Formless Martial Art" to the Level 40 Nascent Soul Peak before the interview began.

Fortunately, his Nascent Soul Sacred Body was at the 12th Layer, and he had sixteen Monsterfolk Clones to assist him. His martial arts practice speed was unprecedented; he could push a martial art to Level 40 almost every day.

If not for the one-day cooldown required by the Feather Book to switch specializations, his cultivation speed would have been even faster.

As Zhang Yu cultivated daily, he could feel the undercurrents surging around him. Many factions and sources of information tried to approach and influence him, but the Righteous Gods blocked them all.

Regardless of how fiercely the two sides clashed in the shadows, Zhang Yu paid almost no attention to the outside world, immersing himself completely in his cultivation.

In the blink of an eye, six days passed. Zhang Yu had advanced the "Formless Martial Art" to the Sixth Layer, cultivating six cultivation arts in this Chain Formation Diagram to the maximum Level 40 of the Nascent Soul Realm.

Basic - Formless Martial Art (6/6): Simulates martial arts. Maximum power does not exceed 50% of the original.

At first glance, Zhang Yu found this effect unremarkable, even inferior to the Third Eye Mystic Power.

After all, the Third Eye Mystic Power allowed him to learn any martial art just by seeing it performed, with no power limit.

Through his experiments, Zhang Yu discovered that the Formless Martial Art required prior knowledge of the target martial art's details before it could be simulated.

"This doesn't seem very useful."

But as Zhang Yu continued to test it, with Martial One, Martial Two, Martial Three, and the other cultivation arts circulating naturally, he began to grasp the true wonder of the Formless Martial Art.

"The Formless Martial Art simulates all types of martial arts in the world by using the ten cultivation arts within its set."

Gang Qi erupted from Zhang Yu's body as streaks of palm shadows shot skyward with the force to tear the heavens and split the earth, only to be silently withdrawn.

"This simulation can directly manifest the subtleties of a Level 40 martial art?"

At that moment, Zhang Yu was simulating the Great Wilderness Mountain-Shifting Force from the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering.

He wasn't circulating the martial art itself. Instead, by using the Formless Martial Art to simulate it, he directly manifested the subtleties of the Great Wilderness Mountain-Shifting Force at Level 10, Level 20, Level 30, and even Level 40.

"Maximum power does not exceed 50% of the original..."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "The numerical values are insufficient, but the mechanics are perfectly simulated."

At that moment, Zhang Yu deeply understood the difference between the Third Eye Mystic Power and the Formless Martial Art.

"The Third Eye Mystic Power allows me to learn a martial art just by seeing it, but I still have to start from Level 1 and cultivate it step by step, leveling it up one level at a time."

"The Formless Martial Art, on the other hand, allows me to instantly simulate and manifest the subtleties of a Level 40 cultivation art on the spot, as long as I know its details beforehand."

Zhang Yu understood that the Level 40 limit was because the ten martial arts within his Formless Martial Art set were only at Level 40.

If he raised Martial One through Martial Ten to Level 50, he could directly simulate the subtleties of a Level 50 cultivation art. By the same logic, if he raised all ten cultivation arts to Level 60, he could instantly simulate the subtleties of a Level 60 cultivation art...

Of course, this was all contingent on the simulated martial art actually having content for Level 50, Level 60, and so on.

As for the process of "understanding the details"...

"This is its only drawback: I need to read the secret manual."

"With the Formless Martial Art, I can simulate the high-level effects of any cultivation art just by reading its secret manual once."

"But..."

Zhang Yu thought of the Third Eye Mystic Power. "If I use the Third Eye Mystic Power to observe, and then combine it with the Formless Martial Art for simulation... could I, without reading the secret manual, directly simulate and advance someone else's martial art just by observing them circulate their cultivation art?"

At this thought, Zhang Yu's heart burned with excitement.

But the next moment, he sighed. "Alas, first, I don't have the copyright to their martial art."

"Second... I only have the Examination Field copyright for Martial One through Martial Ten, meaning I can only use them within the Examination Field."

"I can't use this method openly."

But then, Zhang Yu's eyes flickered again. "However, if I get into the Edict Pavilion, I should be able to use it, right?"

As he continued to study the Formless Martial Art over the past few days, Zhang Yu had begun to form a theory about this cultivation art.

He suspected, "These ten cultivation arts are as vast as the ocean, encompassing all things and containing the principles of all martial arts in the world. It is precisely because of this that they can be used to simulate all martial arts under heaven."

"Perhaps this is the method the Edict Pavilion uses to simulate cultivation arts and then approve their permissions."

At this thought, Zhang Yu wasted no time and continued cultivating his martial arts, eagerly anticipating what the next two effects of the Formless Martial Art would be.

While Zhang Yu was making steady progress each day, a series of investigations into him quietly began across the First to Fifth Layers, spreading like a vast net across the entire world.

The first to be affected was Examiner Lu Xuanzhi.

Facing the sect disciples before him, Lu Xuanzhi stated firmly, "Zhang Yu absolutely did not cheat in the Examination Field. I can guarantee that."

Whether Lu Xuanzhi liked it or not, as the examiner, he was now tied to Zhang Yu's fate.

No matter how the sect disciples questioned or investigated, he stood firm, testifying that Zhang Yu had committed no acts of cheating in the Examination Field.

Meanwhile, many others connected to Zhang Yu were also implicated.

"Dirt on Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen?"

"I already told you. Are you sure you're only giving me that many Spirit Coins?"

Zhou Chechen looked at the stranger before him. "This is a critical moment for their Sect Examination. You want dirt on them now... you're trying to sabotage their chances, aren't you?"

Hearing the stranger raise the price again, Zhou Chechen hurriedly said, "They bullied classmates in high school! Oh, and Bai Zhenzhen stole electricity!"

Yun Zhiguang's gaze flickered at his words. "Stole electricity? They stole things? Were they caught?"

After hearing that Bai Zhenzhen had merely plugged multiple chargers into various classroom outlets, Yun Zhiguang's face twisted in annoyance. "Is there anything else? I need more substantial dirt, preferably something they weren't caught for."

"You call that stealing? Are you trying to praise her for conserving energy?" Yun Zhiguang sneered. "Is there anything else?"

After a fruitless interrogation, Zhou Chechen watched the stranger leave empty-handed. "Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen... even if I did have real dirt on you... I'd probably just let it go."

"Just hurry up and get into the sect so people stop bothering me."

Just then, Deng Bingding's figure materialized. She looked at Zhou Chechen and said, "Don't worry, student. They will definitely pass the Sect Examination this time."

"They will break open the gates of the lower layers Sect Examination for you all. From now on, the lower layers Sect Examination will become a regular event, and you too will have the chance to enter the sect."

"Enter the sect..." Muttering these four words, Zhou Chechen felt his heart tremble. It was as if his blood energy, which had long since cooled, was heating up once more.

An impulse from the depths of his soul, an infinite yearning for the Immortal Dao, made him willing to cast aside all his past grievances and resentments to help Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

Wang Yin stared at the person before him and said coldly, "There's no grudge between me and Zhang Yu or Bai Zhenzhen."

"We were just roughhousing."

"Roughhousing?" Yun Zhiguang frowned. "Wang Yin, think carefully. If you provide useful information, I can get you an outsourced job on the Eleventh Layer, or even a chance at the Sect Examination."

Wang Yin remained silent, watching the stranger's figure dissipate. He thought to himself, "Zhang Yu, you guys better get into that sect. I gave up an outsourced job on the Eleventh Layer for you."

Both the impulse in his heart and the Sect Examination Memories in his mind told Wang Yin that once the Sect Examination became a regular event, he could compete in the lower layers with a massive advantage and secure the best chance of passing.

"Xiang Shan, does Zhang Yu engage in severe monsterfolk discrimination?"

"Was he responsible for that environmental damage incident? The one that ultimately destroyed the medicinal field..."

Staring at Yun Zhiguang and her group, Xiang Shan's mind flashed with the red envelope he'd received, the triple wages he'd earned, the Yu Bonds he'd bought with his entire fortune, and the news Deng Bingding had shared.

After a moment of thought, Xiang Shan said flatly, "Zhang Yu doesn't discriminate against monsterfolk, nor did he cause any environmental damage. It was all my fault — I messed up accidentally."

He thought to himself, "Will I... also get a chance at the Sect Examination in the future?"

Meanwhile, various investigations into Zhang Yu and his companions continued. However, under the Heavenly Court's strict supervision, the sect disciples could only use inducements and normal investigative methods, refraining from any illegal tactics.

Ying Mingchi from Celestial Monsters University stated, "True Monarch Blazing Light is my elder. He possesses a true Monster Heart."

Mo Shangjin from Myriad Laws University said, "I don't recall the True Monarch committing any illegal or criminal acts at the construction site."

Ye Xingli said, "Senior Brother has always been selfless. How could he possibly embezzle funds?"

Looking at the feedback from one investigation after another, Yun Zhiguang snorted coldly. "A bunch of scum from the Lower Realm, banding together... Do they all want to see Zhang Yu pass the Sect Examination so they can get a chance to enter the sect themselves?"

At the same time, recalling the constant obstructions during the investigation and the clues that had surfaced, Yun Zhiguang grew even more certain of her initial suspicions.

"Zhang Pianpian — that woman is the key."

"And True Monarch Starfire. It seems his demotion to the First Layer wasn't a coincidence after all."

"Zhang Yu, Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan, Bai Zhenzhen... Their skills and the exam questions are far too perfectly matched."

"The Heavenly Court must have been planning this all along."

Yun Zhiguang sighed, knowing that with the Heavenly Court's thorough preparations, her side was powerless.

"All we can do now is wait for the interviews."

As time passed, Zhang Yu and the others finally reached the final stage of the Sect Examination: the interviews.
