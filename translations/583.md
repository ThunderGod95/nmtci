# Chapter 583: I Still Prefer Your Previous Rebellious Spirit

The oppressive aura of a Golden Core cultivator emanated from True Person Rising Sun, pressing down on Yu Xinghan with palpable force.

True Person Rising Sun knew that with such an overwhelming disparity in cultivation realms, he wouldn't need elaborate interrogation techniques. Simply subjecting Yu Xinghan to this relentless pressure would be enough to break the Foundation Establishment student's spirit within a short time.

At that point, Yu Xinghan would answer any question asked. Combined with some interrogation tactics, True Person Rising Sun could even make him say exactly what he wanted to hear.

In True Person Rising Sun's view, with such a vast difference in cultivation realms, nothing was beyond his ability to extract, given the opportunity.

However, this matter was of critical importance, and starting with pure interrogation methods would leave him vulnerable to criticism. True Person Rising Sun had initially been reluctant to resort to such tactics.

But now that he had failed to detect the Dual Rest Virus in Yu Xinghan, he knew there was no turning back.

Yet Yu Xinghan's lips proved far tighter than True Person Rising Sun had anticipated, and his will far more resolute than he had expected.

He understood that without resorting to certain methods, he would likely be unable to pry open the other party's mouth.

"Yuqing," True Person Rising Sun said calmly, "disconnect the Spirit Realm covering this room."

Yun Yuqing blinked in surprise, looked at True Person Rising Sun, and hesitated, "Captain..."

True Person Rising Sun frowned. "What are you waiting for? Hurry up!"

After Yun Yuqing left, True Person Rising Sun continued to unleash the pressure of his Golden Core, pressing down on Yu Xinghan like relentless waves.

Watching Yu Xinghan's forehead drip with cold sweat and his face grow increasingly pale, True Person Rising Sun said coldly, "Yu Xinghan, don't cling to false hope. The Dual Rest Cult is a major concern for all three Soul Transformation experts at the academy. The spread of the Dual Rest Virus at the Civil Engineering Department's construction site has long been a top priority for us..."

Yu Xinghan replied, "I'll wait for Director Gao to arrive."

True Person Rising Sun's eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of malice crossing his face. No matter what he said, the other party offered only this one response.

True Person Rising Sun thought to himself, "Why hasn't Yun Yuqing finished yet? What's taking her so long?"

He sent several messages to the other party, but they vanished like a clay ox sinking into the sea, eliciting no response.

Just as True Person Rising Sun began to sense something was amiss, he received a message from his superior, True Monarch Morningstar.

True Monarch Morningstar: Come to my office immediately.

True Person Rising Sun: Division Chief, I'm currently interrogating Yu Xinghan.

True Monarch Morningstar: Stop the interrogation and come here at once.

True Monarch Morningstar: Don't make me come and fetch you myself.

True Person Rising Sun sighed inwardly, "Trying to get things done... why is it so difficult?"

He gave Yu Xinghan a deep look, stood up, and left without a word.

Upon entering True Monarch Morningstar's office, he was astonished to see Zhang Yu sitting opposite the True Monarch.

Witnessing this scene, True Person Rising Sun felt an even darker premonition and immediately began using his Bionic Eye to contact the outside world.

At the same time, True Monarch Morningstar skillfully brewed a cup of Spirit Liquid tea for Zhang Yu, smiling as he said, "...Your Master and I are old acquaintances, both from the same batch of Golden Cores. Back then, she was peerlessly radiant, while I was just a minor figure among those Golden Cores."

Zhang Yu sighed, "No matter how dazzling, brilliant, or extraordinary a Golden Core may be, it's still just a Golden Core. Back then, you were a hidden talent. How many Golden Core True Persons of that era could have achieved what you and my Master have today?"

True Person Rising Sun, listening to their conversation, grew increasingly somber. He opened his mouth to speak, but ultimately remained silent.

True Monarch Morningstar smiled and nodded. "How's the tea?"

Zhang Yu took a sip, his face lighting up with astonishment. "Excellent tea! The Spirit Liquid within is of such high quality — I've never tasted anything like it."

True Monarch Morningstar's smile widened. "It's made with Heaven-Born Water from my hometown. Nowadays, young people are too busy taking pills to appreciate tea. If you like it, I'll give you some to take with you when you leave."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "It's not that young people don't like tea — it's that they can't afford it!"

Meanwhile, True Person Rising Sun listened to their conversation while rapidly formulating a countermeasure. To him, it was clear that True Monarch Morningstar was siding with True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Zhang Yu.

True Person Rising Sun felt a surge of resentment. How could a mere Foundation Establishment student, not even at the Golden Core stage, become a guest of honor to a Nascent Soul True Monarch simply by having a powerful Master? Worse still, this student was now interfering with the Patrol Team's Magic Enforcement duties.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Morningstar's mind was crystal clear. His recent report to Principal Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution had confirmed the Principal's stance. Armed with this knowledge, he felt like he had a strategy guide and X-ray vision, leaving no room for error in his next move.

"The Principal isn't targeting True Monarch Magnetic Pole," Morningstar thought to himself. "On the contrary, he wants to help her."

Morningstar couldn't pinpoint the exact reason, but he speculated it was related to the Soul Transformation Bionic project.

"Is the Principal trying to copy Divine Monarch Jade Nectar?" he wondered inwardly.

Just then, Morningstar seemed to suddenly remember True Person Rising Sun. He glanced at him and said casually, "Rising Sun, have Yu Xinghan's test results come back yet?"

True Person Rising Sun quickly replied, "The results are in, but he still has several issues to explain..."

True Monarch Morningstar asked, puzzled, "If he doesn't have the Dual Rest Virus, what else needs explaining?"

True Person Rising Sun explained, "Although the virus hasn't been detected in his own body, many people he's been in contact with have tested positive for the Dual Rest Virus..."

True Monarch Morningstar's gaze sharpened, and the oppressive aura of his Nascent Soul surged forth, forcing True Person Rising Sun to stagger backward. "What nonsense are you spouting? Contact with someone who has the Dual Rest Virus warrants investigation? If that's the case, should I be investigated too, since I've met so many suspects?"

Overwhelmed by the crushing pressure of the Nascent Soul aura, True Person Rising Sun struggled to speak. "Division Chief, that's not what I meant..."

True Monarch Morningstar snorted coldly, then suddenly extended a finger, as if seizing something from the Spirit Realm. With a flick, he shattered all the messages True Person Rising Sun had sent.

"Stop calling for backup," True Monarch Morningstar said coldly. "This matter is no longer your responsibility."

"Yun Yuqing, come in."

At True Monarch Morningstar's summons, Yun Yuqing entered the office as if she had been waiting outside.

True Monarch Morningstar looked at her and said, "Take Student Zhang Yu to retrieve Yu Xinghan. Help Yu Xinghan complete the necessary procedures."

True Person Rising Sun, standing nearby, glared intently at Yun Yuqing, but his subordinate acted as if she didn't recognize him, obediently leading Zhang Yu away.

True Person Rising Sun turned to True Monarch Morningstar. "Division Chief, there's definitely something suspicious about Yu Xinghan and Zhang Yu. Just give me three days — no, just one more day — and I'll uncover the truth for you."

True Monarch Morningstar replied coolly, "My dear Captain Rising Sun, I wouldn't dare ask you to investigate. Our humble Fourth Division is too small to accommodate a great hero like you."

True Person Rising Sun's face paled. "Division Chief!" he protested, unwilling to give up. "Regardless of whether you believe I have ulterior motives, Zhang Yu is connected to the Demonic Sect. Letting him stay will undoubtedly bring great harm to the school in the future! We can't just ignore this..."

True Monarch Morningstar flicked his finger, sending True Person Rising Sun flying out of the office with a powerful force.

"Division Chief!" True Person Rising Sun clenched his fists, as if shouting, but a talisman fell, silencing him completely.

He roared inwardly, "You'll regret this! You'll all regret this!"

On the other side, Zhang Yu looked at Yu Xinghan and patted his shoulder, surprised to see him so soon.

The key to this swift reunion lay in True Monarch Morningstar's attitude.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "According to Teacher, True Monarch Morningstar's stance reflects the will of Principal Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution."

Lady Fortune explained, "Soul Transformation cultivators rarely express their opinions directly. They usually have their subordinates speak for them. Once a Soul Transformation cultivator takes a public stance, it's difficult to change course, leaving little room for negotiation. Especially in this internal conflict at Myriad Laws University, if a Soul Transformation cultivator were to intervene personally and the situation escalated... it wouldn't be long before civil war erupts."

Meanwhile, Yu Xinghan, having been escorted out of the interrogation room, asked in surprise, "We're free to go?"

Yun Yuqing, standing beside him, replied politely, "Our investigation has cleared you, Student Yu. You're free to leave."

Yun Yuqing escorted them all the way to the main gate, waving goodbye until Zhang Yu and Yu Xinghan's figures disappeared from sight.

Seeing her courteous demeanor, Zhang Yu couldn't help but think, "I still prefer your former rebellious spirit."

Turning his head, Zhang Yu saw Yu Xinghan clutching his head and asked, "Still feeling unwell?"

Yu Xinghan nodded, focusing on the state of the third eye in his mind and recalling its recent changes. A mix of shock and anxiety surged through him.

After completing the Evil God Ritual and becoming a believer of Lady Fortune, Yu Xinghan's latent potential had been awakened, causing his third eye to undergo a profound transformation.

Though the transformation had only recently occurred, Yu Xinghan had already grasped its new capabilities.

"Besides copying others' techniques and improving my martial dao level through observation, I can now even see the flow of their Magic Power, allowing me to completely master their martial arts."

"Damn... If only I could go back to ancient times. Modern society completely stifles my talent."

"What if I accidentally learn martial arts I shouldn't know and inadvertently reveal them? That would be a disaster — I'd go bankrupt from copyright infringement fees!"

"I absolutely can't let anyone discover this ability. Otherwise, countless individuals and corporations will be after me."

On the way home, Yu Xinghan kept his head bowed, avoiding eye contact with anyone on the street, terrified that observing their Magic Power flow would inexplicably cause him to learn a whole array of cultivation arts.
