# Chapter 202: The God of Wealth is First, University and Junior College

"Among the eight ministries, the first to be established by the immortals was the Ministry of Finance and Taxation. The first great god of the Ministry of Finance and Taxation was the Great God of Boundless Wealth and Sea of Fortune."

"The currencies of all layers and sects in Kunxu are issued by this Great God of Boundless Wealth and Sea of Fortune."

"It can be said that among the eight ministries, finance and taxation come first, and this Great God of Boundless Wealth and Sea of Fortune can even be called the god of gods, the god above gods, and is also revered as the God of Wealth."

"But later, the Ten Great Sects gradually discovered that merely controlling the issuance of currency was not enough."

"It is necessary to control the scale and circulation of currency on each layer to better control Kunxu."

"Once a problem arises, it could trigger a Heaven and Earth Calamity, leading to one corporate war after another. Amidst the devastation, who knows how many people would jump off buildings, how many great families would collapse, and how many corporations would fall…"

"After all, the immortals of the Ten Great Sects are not perfect and flawless. In their many years of governing Kunxu, there have been multiple Heaven and Earth Calamities, throwing Kunxu into chaos and turmoil."

"However, those flawless True Immortals who have jumped out of the three loans, are not within the five insurances, and can even issue their own currency are always able to avoid the effects of the Heaven and Earth Calamity. They can always come out to reorganize Kunxu after the calamity ends."

"Later, the immortals of the Ten Great Sects began to have the Eight Ministries of Righteous Gods reclaim the wealth of the world."

Speaking of this, Fu Ji sighed with great longing and envy, "By issuing money with one hand and collecting it with the other, the profits of the entire thirty-six layers of Kunxu are under their control. The life and death, fortune and misfortune of trillions of living beings are all at their whim."

Listening to Fu Ji's long speech, Bai Zhenzhen let out a breath.

As a high school student, she didn't understand everything, but she understood one thing: making money… or rather, currency reclamation, was very important to the righteous gods.

Fu Ji said, "Every righteous god has an annual performance target, which is to make money, or how much currency to reclaim."

"So as long as you give that sixth-rank god an opportunity to make money from the Zhou family, it will be a great contribution for her."

"But even righteous gods cannot act arbitrarily, let alone a mere sixth-rank god like her."

"So what we need to do is give her an opportunity, create a foothold, and she will naturally latch onto the Zhou family."

A few hours later, as Zhang Yu and the others were plotting, their intended enemies made the first move.

Zhang Yu's phone vibrated. It was a message from Yun Ni, the patrol captain in Songyang City.

Yun Ni: The higher-ups suddenly want to check for redundant staff. If you and Bai Zhenzhen don't want to be dismissed from your Divine Assistant positions, you'll have to start working regular office hours every day starting next week.

Zhang Yu's eyebrow twitched slightly. If he had to work in an office every day, where would he find the time to cultivate and earn money?

But Zhang Yu was reluctant to just throw away this outsourced Divine Assistant identity. He immediately asked, "Is there any way to avoid the office hours?"

Yun Ni: No way. The inspection is very strict this time. I can't cover for you.

Fu Ji reminded him from the side, "Ask her if she knows the reason behind it."

After some questioning from Zhang Yu, Yun Ni replied with a single word: Zhou.

Zhang Yu understood. _The Zhou family is making a move again?_

_First the curriculum reform at school and the extra tutoring, and now they want me to work office hours?_

Zhang Yu could feel that they were systematically squeezing his time for studying, cultivating, and earning money. If an ordinary student encountered this, their mentality would likely crumble bit by bit, leading to a drop in grades and a regression in cultivation.

Looking at Yun Ni's reply, Bai Zhenzhen snorted coldly, "What on earth does this Zhou family want? They won't fight, they just keep annoying us step by step?"

Fu Ji said thoughtfully, "They are putting pressure on you."

Zhang Yu said, "In any case… we can't just obediently go work in the office. Since the Zhou family has the ability to influence the higher-ups of the patrol team, going to work will only make us fall into their rhythm and be targeted again and again."

"We must act according to our own rhythm, using the current information asymmetry to deal with the Zhou family."

The next morning, after Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen returned to school on an overnight train.

After activating the detection ritual's power within his body a few times to test, Zhang Yu once again sensed the camera that had been secretly monitoring him.

_Sure enough, they started monitoring again not long after we got back?_

However, neither Zhang Yu nor Bai Zhenzhen showed any sign of it, acting as if they hadn't noticed anyone watching, and continued their normal school routine of classes, cultivation, exercise, and tutoring…

Meanwhile, on the rooftop of a nearby building.

A young man was observing Zhang Yu's life at school through a camera.

The young man was handsome, but at only 1.9 meters tall, he was considered short even among cultivators. Yet, he exuded a fierce aura from within.

His name was Yue Jincheng, a new employee who had been with the Myriad Stars Group security force for less than a year.

When he was first assigned to monitor Zhang Yu, he was diligent and conscientious, not letting a single movement of Zhang Yu's escape his sight, carefully scanning every second of the surveillance footage, hoping to achieve merits soon, get a promotion and a raise, and become a security captain.

After all, in this day and age, there were more and more university students from the second layer of Kunxu, making it extremely difficult for someone from the first layer like him to stay on the second layer.

As a result, more and more university graduates returned to their hometowns after graduation, causing the number of university graduates in Songyang City to increase year by year, and making it harder and harder to find a job.

Yue Jincheng cherished this hard-won job. Since joining, he had been living at the company day and night, paying for his own meals and the company's overnight accommodation fees, following his leader's every move, and never missing an opportunity for overtime.

When he received this surveillance job, he was full of ambition, but the more he watched Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, the more helpless he felt.

Especially watching their day-to-day life, Yue Jincheng felt that his time and life were constantly being worn away.

Unconsciously, he found himself spending more and more time on his phone during work hours.

Looking at Zhang Yu tempering his body through the camera lens, Yue Jincheng sighed inwardly, _At least you're still cultivating. What am I doing, watching you cultivate every day?_

After observing Zhang Yu listlessly for a few hours, Yue Jincheng finally couldn't help but speak into the walkie-talkie, "Senior Si, just waiting like this is not a solution."

"Shouldn't we be more proactive?"

On the other side of the rooftop, a woman was monitoring Bai Zhenzhen while listening to an audiobook.

It was Si Zhouyu, who had previously tailed Bai Zhenzhen during her food deliveries.

Hearing Yue Jincheng's words, Si Zhouyu frowned, "What are you trying to do?"

Yue Jincheng said, "No matter how formidable Zhang Yu or Bai Zhenzhen are, they are just two high school students."

"With our skills, dealing with them, whether it's stealing their phones or sneaking into their apartments, would be a piece of cake."

"Then we'll know all their secrets."

Although Si Zhouyu had similar thoughts and also believed that dealing with two high school students would be easy for cultivators of their level, as an old employee who hadn't received a promotion or raise in twenty years, she wanted a promotion, but she understood even more that one must not act on their own initiative regarding tasks assigned by company leaders.

Si Zhouyu immediately said, "The leader has his reasons for the arrangements. Don't act foolishly."

Yue Jincheng frowned, glanced at Si Zhouyu who was still listening to her audiobook, a hint of disdain in his eyes.

He had already looked down on this senior who hadn't been promoted in over 20 years, and after learning a few days ago that she was just a junior college graduate, he looked down on her even more.

After all, he, Yue Jincheng, was a proper graduate of the 72 lower-tier colleges. That was a real university student.

As for Jinzhou Academy where Si Zhouyu graduated from, did it even deserve to be called a university?

_I can't be like her, wasting my good years away._

_In a year or two, my rank will definitely be above hers._

Time flew by as Yue Jincheng continued his boring surveillance.

That evening, watching Zhang Yu walk toward the subway station after school, Yue Jincheng was slightly taken aback. _This kid usually runs home to save money. Why is he willing to take the subway this time?_

Yue Jincheng had no choice but to follow Zhang Yu onto the subway, beginning to switch between different railway lines.

However, as a peak Qi Refinement employee assigned to track and monitor opponents, he naturally had his own unique methods.

His body shape shifted, his muscles contorting. Combined with the clothes in his backpack, he was able to change his appearance every time he got close to Zhang Yu.

After riding the subway in circles, Yue Jincheng followed Zhang Yu to a subway station in the suburbs.

Watching him run towards the distant suburbs, Yue Jincheng's spirits suddenly lifted.

_Could it be that this kid is finally making a move today?_

_It's time for me to earn my merits._

Just as he was thinking about whether to notify Si Zhouyu, who was monitoring Bai Zhenzhen, he received a message from her.

It turned out that Bai Zhenzhen had also taken the subway to the suburbs.

A short while later, Yue Jincheng and Si Zhouyu gathered together, their spirits somewhat lifted as they watched Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, who were still moving quickly in the distance.

Half an hour later, watching Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen buy tickets and enter the conservation area, both of them frowned.

Yue Jincheng couldn't help but ask, "Should we go in?"

Si Zhouyu said, "Nonsense. We have to follow them in and see who they are meeting."

Yue Jincheng looked at the conservation area's price list with a pained expression and said, "The company will reimburse us, right?"

Si Zhouyu: "Of course."

But she thought to herself, _How long the reimbursement will take is another question. I just hope Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen can give me a surprise this time._

But not long after the two entered the conservation area and found Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen again, they discovered that they had each put on an oxygen mask.

"This is… could it be the package they received at school today?" Si Zhouyu said in astonishment. "It seems they were well-prepared."

Yue Jincheng looked at Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen breathing from their oxygen tanks, then at himself and Si Zhouyu taking deep breaths of the conservation area's air. A sense of foreboding suddenly arose in his heart.

_I hope these two don't stay here for long._

But it was clear that Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, equipped with oxygen tanks, had no intention of leaving right away.

Yue Jincheng and Si Zhouyu could only follow them, watching as their own expense records grew with every breath they took, a growth that made their hearts bleed.
