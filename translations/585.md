# Chapter 585: The Merits of a Character Who Discriminates Against Monsterfolk

After Zhang Yu handed the video to True Monarch Magnetic Pole, she instructed him to undertake another task.

"Go meet True Person Rising Sun," she said.

Zhang Yu asked, "True Person Rising Sun? What for?"

He ventured cautiously, "Besides, he's a Golden Core True Person. As a mere Foundation Establishment disciple, I wouldn't even be able to speak to him properly."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled. "It's not like I'm sending you to fight him. And what good would fighting do anyway? Does he dare lay a finger on you now? You represent me."

After a moment's thought, she elaborated, "Zhang Yu, physically eliminating opponents is a last resort, the most inferior method. Throughout history, sects that relied solely on killing have all perished."

"The superior approach is to learn how to turn people to your advantage, to leverage greater resources and power."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed. "But the ultimate method, the way of the Immortals, is this: regardless of whether you serve them or what your intentions may be, every action you take, every word you speak... ultimately becomes nourishment for their Immortal Dao."

With a wave of her hand, True Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "I'll lend you the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda for now. Go talk to True Person Rising Sun."

"Tell him that if he's willing to reveal who's behind him, I can guarantee his safety."

After leaving the laboratory, Zhang Yu immediately sensed an invisible force enveloping him within the Spirit Realm.

Within his Bionic Eye, a new button had appeared, labeled "On/Off."

As Zhang Yu focused his mind on the button, a phantom image of the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda suddenly erupted behind him, startling him.

Simultaneously, a row of new buttons materialized in his Bionic Eye: Ghost-God Evasion, All Evils Repelled, Indestructible Vajra, Spirit Realm Transversal...

Most of the buttons were grayed out, indicating that True Monarch Magnetic Pole hadn't granted Zhang Yu permission to activate them.

Sensing growing attention from others, Zhang Yu quickly refocused his mind on the button and deactivated the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda.

"But where is that Rising Sun guy now?"

After a moment's thought, Zhang Yu sent a message to Zhang Pianpian: "Senior Sister, do you know True Person Rising Sun's current location?"

On the Flying Boat.

As University City gradually shrank into the distance, True Person Rising Sun's brow furrowed deeper.

Today was the day he was to take up his post at the Vocational College.

He couldn't even remember the college's name, simply referring to it as the Vocational College.

Not a single person had sent him a farewell message through the Spirit Realm, let alone come to see him off, even as he boarded the Flying Boat.

At this thought, True Person Rising Sun couldn't help but sigh at the fickleness of human nature.

But in the next moment, a faint ripple of Spirit Realm energy flashed through the air, and a figure seemed to have traversed countless mountains and rivers, materializing directly before him through the Spirit Realm.

When he recognized the figure, True Person Rising Sun's expression shifted slightly. "Zhang Yu?"

Standing before him was Zhang Yu, who had activated the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda's Spirit Realm Transversal ability to project his Spirit Realm Projection directly to the Flying Boat.

True Person Rising Sun's face hardened with hostility. "What do you want?" he asked coldly.

Looking at the True Person before him, Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "True Person Rising Sun, do you remember? Our first meeting was also on a Flying Boat."

Hearing this, True Person Rising Sun's expression grew even colder.

Zhang Yu continued, "Are you truly content to go to the Vocational College?"

Seeing that the other party remained silent, Zhang Yu continued, "Life offers many paths, and none of them require us to walk blindly down a single, predetermined road."

"As the saying goes, 'A wise bird chooses its tree.' With your cultivation and abilities, wouldn't attending a Vocational College be a waste of your talents?"

As he spoke, the radiant glow of the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda materialized behind Zhang Yu, causing True Person Rising Sun's expression to flicker slightly.

"The Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda..." True Person Rising Sun immediately recognized the signature magical artifact of True Monarch Magnetic Pole, confirming that Zhang Yu had indeed been sent as her representative.

A flicker of hesitation crossed True Person Rising Sun's mind, but remembering the promises he had received from the other side, he declared in a deep voice, "I don't know what you're talking about, nor do I care to find out."

"Leave. I don't want to see you again."

Undeterred by the abrupt rejection, Zhang Yu smiled faintly and vanished into thin air.

True Person Rising Sun turned his gaze toward University City, now reduced to a tiny black dot on the horizon. He recalled his first meeting with Zhang Yu aboard the Flying Boat, never imagining how drastically things would change.

"I will return."

---

After concluding his communication with True Person Rising Sun, Zhang Yu returned the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda to True Monarch Magnetic Pole and reported True Person Rising Sun's response.

Director Gao then contacted him again.

Director Gao: Are you alright? I was planning to visit the Patrol Team, but I didn't expect Yu Xinghan to be released so quickly.

Zhang Yu briefly explained the situation at the construction site. Director Gao replied: The construction site definitely needs a thorough cleanup.

Director Gao: The reason I contacted you this time is precisely for this matter.

Director Gao: I plan to implement daily Dual Rest Virus testing at all Civil Engineering Department construction sites.

Director Gao: Your company will need to cooperate with this initiative.

Zhang Yu: I will lead the way in full cooperation.

Seeing Zhang Yu's response, Director Gao nodded slightly and began issuing instructions to the Civil Engineering Department's work group.

In truth, Director Gao had long suspected the spread of the Dual Rest Virus at construction sites and had been wanting to conduct comprehensive testing and screening for some time.

However, implementing such measures would slow down construction efficiency and increase costs for the higher-ups, reducing their profits.

For the workers, it would shorten their working hours and decrease their income.

In short, everyone on the construction site, from top to bottom, resisted the Dual Rest Virus testing. Director Gao's proposal was immediately opposed by numerous leaders, board members, and subordinates.

But now, riding the momentum of the Patrol Team's crackdown on the Dual Rest Virus, Director Gao was pushing for the initiative again.

This time, while the workers remain uncooperative, the upper-level leaders had finally agreed to Director Gao's approach.

After all, the Patrol Team has inspected several construction sites recently, and any Dual Rest Virus exposure would lead to immediate work stoppages. It's better for the Civil Engineering Department to conduct internal inspections and remove infected individuals proactively.

---

At the construction site, Yu Xinghan lined up with Ying Xin and the others, preparing for the day's Dual Rest Virus testing.

Thanks to Director Gao's vigorous promotion, daily Dual Rest Virus testing and prevention campaigns were now mandatory at all construction sites.

Yu Xinghan's ears were filled with the grumbling of workers around him, while the figures in his Third Eye flickered in and out of view.

Over the past few weeks, Yu Xinghan had been diligently working to master his Third Eye.

The Third Eye had become far more powerful than before. Simply seeing someone now allowed him to learn their active martial arts techniques.

But Yu Xinghan shared Zhang Yu's view: he had no interest in learning a bunch of useless, ordinary martial arts that would only increase his risk of exposure.

Instead, he focused on controlling his Third Eye, striving to prevent it from automatically absorbing everything and mastering the ability to selectively activate and deactivate its learning mode.

Yu Xinghan raised his head, his gaze fixed on Shi Huaiyu. Observing the flow of Magic Power within her, he felt a surge of satisfaction. "Under control. No more indiscriminate learning."

Currently, Yu Xinghan's favorite subject for observation with his Third Eye was Shi Huaiyu. After all, she possessed the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering and had mastered the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power. Even if he learned her cultivation arts, it would be a worthwhile endeavor, making her the perfect practice target.

Just then, a commotion erupted in the distance.

Yu Xinghan turned to see a large group of monsterfolk chanting slogans in protest against mandatory Dual Rest Virus testing.

"Daily testing is discrimination against monsterfolk!"

"So-called prevention measures completely disregard our culture!"

"Why should we reduce dual cultivation frequency? How can dual cultivation transmit the Dual Rest Virus?"

In the laboratory, Zhang Yu watched news reports showing monsterfolk workers protesting virus testing at multiple construction sites. Some even gathered in large numbers to openly practice dual cultivation as a direct challenge to the testing procedures.

"There must be someone behind this," he muttered.

"I wonder if they're the same group backing Xiang Shan and True Person Rising Sun..."

As he reviewed various videos, Zhang Yu reaffirmed one crucial point: his Third Eye still couldn't penetrate screens to observe the flow of Magic Power within others' bodies.

"To truly see the circulation of Magic Power within the physical meridians, I'll need to observe people in person."

Glancing at notifications flooding his social media platform, Zhang Yu casually scanned through the torrent of insults from monsterfolk.

Xiang Shan had become a figurehead for countless students at Celestial Monsters University, a symbol of oppression by the Human Race.

Naturally, Zhang Yu was now seen as the Human Race's representative of that oppression.

Celestial Monsters University's staggering monster population had brought forth a massive influx of Soul Cultivator Students, making them a formidable force even within the Spirit Realm. Wherever they went, they often overwhelmed comment sections.

"These guys," Zhang Yu thought to himself, "when they meet me in the real world and see my Military Certificate and ranking, they kneel down in utmost respect. But as soon as they enter the Spirit Realm, their courage swells a hundredfold."

Zhang Yu could sense that while few were willing to publicly defend him against the monsterfolk's attacks in the Spirit Realm, many secretly supported him. This was evident from the likes he received, particularly from Mo Shangjin and Xiao Qingxuan of the Civil Engineering Department, as well as Yan Qianji, Bei Wufeng, and Ye Xingli of the Artifact Refinement Department.

"Especially Bei Wufeng," Zhang Yu noted, "he likes every single one of my posts. That guy's the real bigot here. Yet instead of attacking him, these monsters come after me, the one who doesn't discriminate."

Zhang Yu clicked on Bei Wufeng's profile and noticed that his avatar had been changed.

"Did he change his profile picture because the old one was too aggressive towards monsterfolk, given the current tense situation?"

Beyond the likes, Zhang Yu noticed a significant increase in refinement commissions recently, which he promptly delegated to the Heavenly Sun Radiance God and his assistants to handle for profit.

He mused inwardly, "While monsterfolk are numerous, how many can actually afford magical artifacts and Bionics? They were never my target clientele anyway."

"On the other hand, those who discriminate against monsterfolk... many of them are quite wealthy."

"Adopting an anti-monsterfolk persona might actually attract more business."

Watching the monsterfolk still tirelessly arguing in the comments section, Zhang Yu thought, "Keep ranting, keep ranting. The more you do, the more business you'll bring me."

After casually skimming through the latest news in the Spirit Realm, Zhang Yu resumed practicing the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon.

It was now June, and next month he would formally challenge Bei Wufeng for his spot on the school team.

In the coming weeks, Zhang Yu planned to fully immerse himself in cultivating the art, striving to advance its refinement level as much as possible.
