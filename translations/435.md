# Chapter 435: Signing the Contract

Director Gao: "This is True Monarch Magnetic Pole."

Director Gao: "She's the teacher from the Artifact Refinement Department."

Director Gao: "Didn't I invite her to mentor you during the last Civil Engineering Competition?"

Zhang Yu: "Oh, it's her? I didn't realize she was from the Artifact Refinement Department. You never mentioned it."

Zhang Yu: "She's not a Civil Engineering teacher, and we haven't been in touch since that competition. I'd completely forgotten her name."

Director Gao: "So, what do you think of artifact crafting?"

Zhang Yu: "I'm actually quite interested in it!"

Feeling Zhang Yu shift slightly in her arms, True Monarch Magnetic Pole chuckled. "Stay still, little one. Don't fidget."

"Are you uncomfortable in my arms?"

Zhang Yu: "N-no!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole's lips curled slightly. "So you're quite comfortable, then?"

Seeing Zhang Yu's stunned expression, she pressed further. "Are you more comfortable in Teacher Gao's arms, or mine?"

Zhang Yu: "Huh?"

Lady Fortune sighed at Zhang Yu's bewildered look. "Zhang Yu, you're doomed. This woman is your natural nemesis. Neither you nor your mentor stand a chance against her!"

Zhang Yu mentally replied to Lady Fortune, "I was just caught off guard and didn't know how to respond!"

Lady Fortune warned, "Be careful. That woman is clearly someone who'd stop at nothing. The way she's talking to you right now is very targeted; she must have thoroughly studied your character and habits!"

Meanwhile, Director Gao had already replied: "You want to learn artifact crafting?"

Zhang Yu: "I think Bionics and magical artifacts are essential for the Immortal Dao!"

Zhang Yu: "Learning more about artifact crafting can only be beneficial. It'll help me avoid getting ripped off when buying magical artifacts!"

Zhang Yu: "As for mastering actual artifact crafting techniques, I don't have the resources for that."

Zhang Yu: "Teacher, right now I just want to focus wholeheartedly on mastering the fundamentals of our Civil Engineering Department, quickly master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, and then make a big splash on construction sites!"

Director Gao: chuckles "Don't be impatient. Your chance will come!"

Zhang Yu: "Teacher, does that mean I can start practicing the Seven Civil Engineering Techniques once I get my Military Certificate?"

Director Gao: "See? You're rushing again!"

Director Gao: "Until the Heavenly Court announces the results, nothing is settled yet!"

"Director Gao," True Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "we need to be careful about appearances. Don't go around spreading news about the Military Certificate, understand?"

"Understood, Teacher!" Zhang Yu replied.

I'm just so eager to learn the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power! Zhang Yu thought, watching the exchange between True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Director Gao. Is True Monarch Magnetic Pole trying to make Director Gao believe I'm fully committed to staying in the Civil Engineering Department to study the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power?

After a few more exchanges, Director Gao asked, "Has Director Lin contacted you?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole turned to Zhang Yu. "Has he?"

Zhang Yu immediately recounted everything about Director Lin's and the Old Director's approaches and their offers, leaving nothing out.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole relayed the entire conversation to Director Gao.

Moments later, True Monarch Magnetic Pole closed the communication window and turned to Zhang Yu. "Old Gao will likely contact you soon to sign a contract and formally accept you as his disciple."

"Just sign it when he does."

Sensing Zhang Yu's puzzled expression, True Monarch Magnetic Pole added calmly, "Don't worry, the contract will be relatively lenient and won't overly restrict you."

"As for our relationship..." True Monarch Magnetic Pole's lips curled slightly as she gazed at Zhang Yu in her arms, a smile of complete control spreading across her face. "I care more about practical results than mere titles!"

"Until you master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, you'll remain Old Gao's good disciple."

"My Civil Engineering Heavenly Chosen, Zhang Yu!"

Zhang Yu asked, "What if I master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power by my third year?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole waved dismissively. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."

Though she acknowledged the possibility, it was clear she considered it highly unlikely.

Meanwhile, Ye Xingli trailed True Monarch Magnetic Pole, her anxiety growing as they approached Zhang Yu's dormitory floor.

"We're almost there!"

"Why are they still talking?"

"Should I interrupt?"

But seeing True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Zhang Yu engrossed in their conversation, Ye Xingli hesitated, unsure whether to intervene.

---

At a deserted street corner...

With a resounding thud, Zhang Yu landed heavily on the ground, like a truckload of cargo.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled. "Young man, you ate well during this examination!"

Zhang Yu chuckled awkwardly. He had indeed grabbed a few snacks while taking the test.

"True Monarch, I'll head back now," Zhang Yu said.

"Hmm, go on," True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied casually.

As Zhang Yu turned to leave, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's figure flickered slightly and vanished without a trace.

"Xingli, you should continue guiding this boy in artifact crafting."

Hearing True Monarch Magnetic Pole's words, Ye Xingli couldn't help but ask, "Master, you... seem to treat him differently from other students."

"Different students require different methods of instruction," True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly. "That's called tailored teaching."

"Do you know Zhang Yu's roommates?"

"Zhang Yu's roommates?" Ye Xingli hadn't really thought about it before and didn't see much point in knowing.

The Magnetic Pole Monarch continued, "All of Zhang Yu's roommates are fellow villagers from the First Layer."

Ye Xingli exclaimed in surprise, "Ah? All from the First Layer?"

Ye Xingli didn't consider herself prejudiced against First Layer residents. She simply believed that most of them were poor, foolish, and possessed exceptionally weak potential for the Immortal Dao.

Zhang Yu, a genius who had climbed all the way from the First Layer, had already far exceeded Ye Xingli's expectations.

She never imagined he would still be living with his First Layer villagers... How could he possibly tolerate it?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "In summary, based on all available information, Zhang Yu is someone who values old ties."

As if recalling something, True Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed, "Heh, valuing old ties... How long has it been since I last used that phrase?"

---

Zhang Yu returned to his dormitory and collapsed onto his bed with a thud.

His severely injured body had long been pushed to its limits. Now that the day's events had finally come to an end, he couldn't help but relax completely.

Tu Lishan: How did the exam go?

As Zhang Yu read Tu Lishan's message, he recalled the waves of concern he had received after the Military Certificate Examination. He sighed inwardly, "Who says Kunxu lacks human warmth? The better my grades get, the more human warmth I find at Myriad Laws University!"

Shortly after lying down, the chilling power of the ritual resurfaced. With a resigned sigh, Zhang Yu decided to enter the Supreme Clarity Realm and continue studying the advanced artifact crafting courses.

Several hours later, Zhang Yu received a message from Director Gao, offering him formal discipleship and a supplementary contract.

After reviewing the contract, Zhang Yu realized True Monarch Magnetic Pole had been right. The terms were relatively lenient, placing few restrictions on him.

"But... is this a contract with a company?"

"Is this company owned by Director Gao?"

Zhang Yu continued reading. In essence, the contract stipulated that the company would reimburse him 30 Spirit Coins per month for his cultivation expenses until he obtained his Golden Core qualification certificate.

After Zhang Yu broke through to the Golden Core stage, he would be required to undertake a certain amount of work as specified, with profits split evenly between him and the company.

Most other details in the contract revolved around these core terms.

Zhang Yu mused, "30 Spirit Coins a month... that's 360 a year! I never imagined I'd become a student who could spend that much annually!"

Lady Fortune commented, "This is an unusually fair contract for Kunxu. According to these terms, even after you reach the Golden Core stage, Director Gao will only make a modest profit."

"However, once you break through to the Nascent Soul stage, he'll start earning big!"

"It seems Director Gao is truly betting on you reaching the Nascent Soul stage."

"As for when you reach the Soul Transformation stage, this contract will likely need to be renegotiated!"

The next day, Zhang Yu and Director Gao completed the contract signing under the witness of a Righteous God, officially making Zhang Yu Director Gao's formal disciple.

Director Gao gazed at Zhang Yu before him, nodding in satisfaction. "I told you to stay in the hospital for proper treatment yesterday. Why did you run off on your own?"

Zhang Yu replied, "Teacher, you know my constitution. There's no need to waste money in the hospital!"

"You little rascal!" Director Gao chuckled, feigning anger. "Do you think I need you to save me money?"

With that, he reached out and pulled Zhang Yu closer, his Magic Power flowing through the young man's body.

Instantly, Director Gao sensed that Zhang Yu's injuries had indeed healed significantly.

Particularly impressed by the vibrant vitality pulsing through Zhang Yu's flesh and blood, his satisfaction with this disciple deepened.

Yet his expression remained impassive as he said, "The Civil Engineering Competition is coming up soon. You need to focus on fully recovering. Understand?"

Zhang Yu looked surprised. "Huh? Isn't the competition in December? It's only October now!"

Director Gao explained, "Starting this year, the competition format is changing again."

After all, in recent years, students' practical skills had improved dramatically, and the intensity of the competition had grown fiercer.

"In this format, completing the entire competition in just one or two days is too risky. It not only increases the cost of the event but also makes it difficult for students to fully showcase their abilities!"

"For Inter-University competitions, some universities have been protesting for years. This year, the Civil Engineering Competition's Inter-University League has been restructured into a series of matches spread over several months, with breaks in between!"

"Our university's Civil Engineering Department is planning to adopt a similar format for our internal competitions!"

"The matches will start in late October and continue until December!"

Hearing Director Gao's explanation, Zhang Yu thought the change sounded promising. At least for him, it was excellent news, giving him more time to recover from his injuries and improve his skills!

Director Gao looked at Zhang Yu and continued, "There's one more thing I wanted to mention."

"For the department's internal competition, just lead your current team to the top seven and secure a spot in the Seven Civil Engineering Techniques."

"When the Inter-University League begins, I'll assign you to Mo Shangjin's team. You can go with him and gain some experience!"
