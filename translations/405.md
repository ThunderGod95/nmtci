# Chapter 405: The Myriad Laws Soul Transformation Cultivators, Cultivation Drug Trials

Hearing Xiao Qingxuan's words, Zhang Yu asked curiously, "Has the intensity of the University War escalated again?"

Xiao Qingxuan nodded. "It started with just a few vocational colleges fighting."

"Gradually, universities from the 72 Lower Colleges began to join in."

"Recently, teachers from the 36 Upper Colleges have been discovered participating in the battles, and some students have even been killed."

Zhang Yu said, "Senior Xiao, do you think the Ten Greats will intervene?"

Xiao Qingxuan shook his head.

Zhang Yu asked, "You don't think so?"

Zhang Yu was surprised that Xiao Qingxuan, a member of the War Faction, believed the Ten Great Universities wouldn't join the conflict.

Xiao Qingxuan explained, "I don't know."

"Whether the Ten Greats will intervene ultimately isn't up to the lower-tier schools to decide."

"As long as the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs remain committed to peace, the Ten Greats won't intervene, no matter how fiercely the lower tiers fight — even if they turn the Second, Third, and Fourth Layers into scorched earth."

"But who can truly know what the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs are thinking?"

"Moreover, their opinions likely aren't unified."

"For example, among the three principals of Myriad Laws University, some probably favor war while others advocate for peace."

"Otherwise, why would the Civil Engineering Department be divided into two factions?"

"Ultimately, the attitudes of each faculty are merely extensions of the three principals' wills. The choices of students and teachers are simply coerced by the benefits offered by the Divine Monarchs..."

As Xiao Qingxuan spoke, Zhang Yu nodded repeatedly.

Having been at Myriad Laws University for so long, he knew that the university's three Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs currently served as principal and vice-principals.

Of course, Myriad Laws University had more than two vice-principals. In addition to the two Soul Transformation Divine Monarch vice-principals, there were also five Nascent Soul True Monarchs serving as vice-principals, each overseeing different domains.

Zhang Yu asked, "Regarding the faculties, I know that the Artifact Refinement Engineering Faculty, where the Artifact Refinement Department is located, is pro-war, while the Economics and Management Faculty, where the Finance Department is located, is pro-peace. What about the Dao Techniques Faculty, where the Dao Techniques Department is?"

Although Zhang Yu had asked Zhang Pianpian a similar question before, he was curious to hear Xiao Qingxuan's perspective.

Xiao Qingxuan replied calmly, "The Finance and Artifact Refinement Departments, as two of the three Ace Departments, essentially embody the majority of their respective facultys' essence, thus determining their overall stance."

"However, the Dao Techniques Faculty is unique. In addition to the Dao Techniques Department, which is also an Ace Department, it also houses the Talisman Department."

"Speaking of the Dao Techniques Department, they're major producers, transporters, and sellers of Magic Power. Their stance on the University War likely favors limited regional tensions to drive up Magic Power prices, while avoiding full-scale war that could lead to uncontrollable losses."

"As for the Talisman Department, though not an Ace Department of Myriad Laws University, they represent the power and attitude of the Righteous Gods, which can still influence the decisions of the entire Dao Techniques Faculty."

"But the Righteous Gods have always remained observers in the University War. It's hard to say what their true intentions are..."

As Zhang Yu and Xiao Qingxuan walked and talked, Zhang Yu realized that despite being Ten Thousand Deficit, his senior had a deep understanding of the school's various factions and leaders. Their conversation gave Zhang Yu a fresh perspective on the current situation.

Just then, Zhang Yu noticed a statue kneeling on the ground. "What's this?" he asked curiously. "Why is there a statue in the factory?"

Xiao Qingxuan frowned, a flicker of distaste in his eyes as he glanced at the statue.

After a moment's hesitation, he explained, "The work at the Pharmaceutical Factory is monotonous. Prolonged labor can lead to psychological stress, mental exhaustion, and mechanical alienation."

"This has resulted in workers taking their own lives."

"But you know, the operators are on the assembly line 24/7. Each one has become an integral part of the line, tightly integrated into the entire production process."

"Therefore, an operator's suicide often causes the assembly line to stall, impacting the Pharmaceutical Factory's production efficiency."

"To address this, the factory adds Happiness Potions to the operators' drinking water. This reduces stress, dulls their minds, and makes them work more happily."

"They've also improved the operators' transformation surgery, enhancing replaceability and modularizing the operators..."

"Beyond these hardware improvements, they've erected 'Suicide Shame Statues' to stigmatize suicide, promote a modern worker ethos that shames suicide, and select model workers to boost the operators' sense of factory honor..."

As Xiao Qingxuan explained, a figure appeared in the Spirit Realm Projection beside them, wearing the Pharmaceutical Factory's uniform and moving among the operators' Bionics, conducting product quality checks.

Noticing Zhang Yu's gaze toward the projection, Xiao Qingxuan said, "That's a Soul Cultivator Employee."

"Workers who die from overwork on the factory's assembly line not only avoid compensation for lost wages but can also become Soul Cultivators, continuing to work for the factory."

"As a student of the Ten Greats, you might not understand, but for many Junior College Students, this is a good job."

Zhang Yu looked at the workers assembling components on the assembly line and noticed that many of them gazed at the Soul Cultivator's projection with clear longing.

Of course, most Junior College Students were secretly observing Zhang Yu and Xiao Qingxuan. To them, these two Myriad Laws University students seemed dazzlingly out of reach.

The Junior College Students on this assembly line all came from the same school. While observing Zhang Yu and Xiao Qingxuan, they chattered about them in their group chat.

One person typed: "Myriad Laws University students just look so rich."

Another replied: "Need you even ask? He's the powerhouse who owes 10,000 Spirit Coins!"

Someone agreed: "Even if he killed Junior College Students every day, it would take forever to rack up 10,000 Spirit Coins, right? He probably had to kill a few Vocational College Teachers along the way too."

Another commented: "No wonder he's a Myriad Laws University student. His personal debt is more than all of ours combined."

After Zhang Yu and Xiao Qingxuan finished surveying the factory, they completed measuring and recording the building's data.

Then, Zhang Yu followed Xiao Qingxuan to the adjacent construction site, where they began excavating the underground space and laying the foundation.

Zhang Yu unleashed the Great Wilderness Mountain-Shifting Force with a single palm strike. A visible shockwave erupted, shattering vast swathes of rock into rubble.

Simultaneously, Formless Warriors surged from behind Zhang Yu, already beginning to clear the construction site, transport building materials, and dispose of debris.

After the rock layers were crushed, excavated, and cleared, Zhang Yu activated the Heaven-Turning Seal martial art. Palm after palm, each strike wrapped in Gang Qi, he relentlessly pressed down, leveling the ground.

Watching the construction site rapidly take shape, Xiao Qingxuan nodded in approval. "Director Gao was right," he thought. "Zhang Yu alone is more than enough for this project."

A moment later, he turned to Zhang Yu and said, "Besides the construction work at the Pharmaceutical Factory, Director Gao has also arranged a drug testing position for you. I'll take you there shortly."

---

Inside the office building, Zhang Yu observed the students from the 72 Lower Colleges lining the corridor and asked curiously, "Are they all here to test drugs?"

Xiao Qingxuan nodded. "Junior college students' bodies are too fragile. Some drugs require true university students to properly assess their effects."

Zhang Yu understood. On the Second Layer, junior college students often lacked even the qualifications to participate in drug trials.

As a student from Myriad Laws University, Zhang Yu's involvement in drug trials naturally required higher standards.

As Zhang Yu headed directly toward the laboratory, the surrounding students from the 72 Lower Colleges collectively cast envious glances.

"A Foundation Establishment student from Myriad Laws University? They're testing drugs too?"

"The drugs they're testing must be incredibly potent. Even their excrement could probably kill us."

"What nonsense! How could an academic overachiever from Myriad Laws University even need to excrete?"

Upon entering the laboratory, Zhang Yu found Le Mulan already waiting.

Seeing Zhang Yu and Xiao Qingxuan, Le Mulan smiled and said, "Zhang Yu, the Mentor instructed me to coordinate the drug trials with you."

Xiao Qingxuan turned to Zhang Yu. "I'll wait outside. Call me if you need anything."

Xiao Qingxuan recalled Director Gao's instructions.

"Old Gao really values Zhang Yu, ordering me to provide immediate medical support so he can take large doses of experimental drugs and further accelerate his cultivation efficiency."

After Xiao Qingxuan left, Le Mulan approached Zhang Yu, pulling out a thick syringe. "This experimental drug will accelerate your metabolism and enhance your body refinement efficiency, but it will also cause mental overstimulation, bodily congestion, and disruptions in your Magic Power circulation..."

As she explained, Le Mulan skillfully injected the drug into Zhang Yu's body.

This was partly because Zhang Yu had consciously relaxed his muscles, skin, and Magic Power defenses, and partly due to Le Mulan's precise needle insertion, demonstrating her exceptional injection technique.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Le Mulan has been giving injections since high school. Her technique is far superior to mine, probably even surpassing the students in the Security Department."

Indeed, Zhang Yu compared her injection skills to those of the Security Department students. After all, these guys claimed to give the most injections in the entire school daily, making their technique even more advanced than that of the average Medical Faculty students.

As Le Mulan administered the injection to Zhang Yu, her mind drifted back to the task her mentor had assigned her.

"To prepare for the escalating intensity of the University War, the department has decided to develop several new medications."

"This Zhang Yu from the Civil Engineering Department is quite intriguing. I've reviewed his data from the Biology Department, and I want to see if we can create drugs using his vital energy factors and bloodline expression."

"Le Jingchen said he's unwilling to sell his breeding rights, correct? He's even stopped selling his seed now?"

"Ask him again. I'm willing to offer a high price."

Faced with Le Mulan's inquiry, Zhang Yu naturally refused outright. Whether due to Lady Fortune's warning or his own convictions, he had no interest in selling his breeding rights.

In fact, Zhang Yu had even stopped selling his seed.

He waved his hand dismissively and said, "Since dedicating myself to the Immortal Dao and abstaining from worldly desires, I haven't produced any goods for quite some time."

"I feel excellent now, and I doubt I'll ever return to that line of work."

Yet as Le Mulan watched Zhang Yu's retreating figure, her mind flashed back to her mentor's words about him. She couldn't shake the feeling that her mentor hadn't revealed the full truth and wouldn't give up so easily.
