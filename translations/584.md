# Chapter 584: Transferred to Vocational College, Comment Section Overrun by Monsterfolk

Yu Xinghan's heart was brimming with hundreds, even thousands, of questions he desperately wanted to ask Zhang Yu about the changes he had brought about and the Evil God Ritual.

Though he yearned for answers, Yu Xinghan knew this was neither the time nor place to ask. He couldn't even send a message; he had to keep his questions bottled up inside.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu finally had the time and inclination to examine Yu Xinghan's evolved Dao Seed.

He switched his Azure Lotus Sword Embryo (Spiritual Root) to the Third Eye Mystic Power (Spiritual Root) and briefly scanned the street. A wave of astonishment washed over him before he quickly switched back to the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo.

Zhang Yu murmured to himself, "What a formidable Dao Seed."

"With this Third Eye Mystic Power, one could master any martial art with a single glance, mastering it instantly."

However, he quickly realized that this power couldn't be used indiscriminately.

"First, while daily life exposes me to many people and cultivation arts, most of these arts are quite ordinary. Mastering them would offer little benefit and only increase the risk of exposure."

"Especially compared to openly using the Third Eye Mystic Power to learn martial arts everywhere, it's far better to continue enhancing the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo and improving the Chain Formation Diagram's effectiveness."

"If I were to use the Third Eye Mystic Power to steal martial arts, I should target specific individuals, planning each theft meticulously rather than randomly stealing from anyone on the street."

As the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo returned to his mind, Zhang Yu quickly considered another question: "I never imagined that Yu Xinghan's potential, awakened by the Evil God Ritual, would cause such a qualitative transformation in the Third Eye Mystic Power."

A glance at the Feather Book revealed that the Third Eye Mystic Power remained at the 3rd-tier in the Dao Seed Register, showing no sign of advancement.

"It's not an upgrade, but a pure qualitative change. The same tier now possesses far greater capabilities."

"But why did Yu Xinghan's awakened potential enhance his Dao Seed's abilities, while A-Zhen's didn't improve the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo?"

Zhang Yu couldn't grasp the underlying principles, only speculating, "Could it be that the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo's potential has already reached its limit? Or perhaps the Evil God Ritual simply can't interfere with it?"

He shook his head, unable to find a satisfactory explanation.

Then, another thought struck him.

"After Yu Xinghan's potential was unlocked, his Third Eye Mystic Power grew stronger."

"If Le Mulan's potential were unlocked, would it enhance the power of her Profound Cold Meridian?"

"And what about Ye Xingli, or even Master... If their potential were unlocked, would it amplify the power of their Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart and Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology?"

The thought made Zhang Yu's heart race with excitement.

However, he knew that Ye Xingli and True Monarch Magnetic Pole would never become believers of the Evil God. If he dared voice such a suggestion, they would likely report him on the spot.

As for Le Mulan...

Zhang Yu wasn't entirely confident. Even helping Yu Xinghan unlock his potential had felt like a risky gamble.

"I'll have to observe further..." Zhang Yu mused inwardly. "Perhaps I can find an opportunity to test the waters."

The next day, True Person Rising Sun arrived at his office, his Bionic Eye displaying a stream of news headlines.

He found no mention of the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's interception the previous day, nor any reports of the sudden inspection at Zhang Yu's construction site. True Person Rising Sun immediately realized that someone higher up had suppressed the information, likely to minimize the impact and prevent further coverage.

As he scanned the news, True Person Rising Sun asked, "Where's Yun Yuqing?"

No one answered.

True Person Rising Sun frowned. The atmosphere in the office grew increasingly unsettling. Everyone seemed to have lost their tongues; not only did no one initiate conversation with him, but he could sense them deliberately keeping their distance.

Gritting his teeth at this realization, True Person Rising Sun waited a long while before finally receiving a message from one of his subordinates.

"Captain, haven't you heard?"

True Person Rising Sun replied, "Heard what?"

The other party didn't respond, further fueling True Person Rising Sun's growing frustration.

Just then, a message finally appeared in his Bionic Eye, startling him so violently that he shot to his feet. The aura of his Golden Core erupted, causing his long robes to billow and crackle under the force of the Gang Qi.

"They're transferring me to a Vocational College?!"

True Person Rising Sun stormed out of his office and arrived at True Monarch Morningstar's office moments later. He took a deep breath and demanded, "Division Chief, what's the meaning of this transfer order?"

True Monarch Morningstar replied calmly, "The investigation into your violation of Magic Enforcement regulations is complete. The severity of your actions is considerable, and the higher authorities are taking this matter very seriously."

True Person Rising Sun protested, "What violation are you talking about?"

True Monarch Morningstar countered, "You know perfectly well what you did. Is abusing your authority to harass students the behavior of a qualified Patrol Team Member? Go down there and reflect on your actions."

True Person Rising Sun gritted his teeth and retorted, "Vocational Colleges are a dump!They're not fit for anyone!"

True Monarch Morningstar's voice turned icy. "If I hadn't intervened on your behalf, you wouldn't even be going to a Vocational College."

"Alright, that's all I have to say. Hurry up and hand over your duties, then go to the Vocational College."

True Person Rising Sun walked out of True Monarch Morningstar's office in a daze, his mind half frozen, half burning, filled with both anger and despair.

But moments later, he snapped awake as if jolted by electricity. He knew he couldn't rot away at the Vocational College; otherwise, his life would be an endless torment.

True Person Rising Sun remembered someone and immediately contacted them. "This is what happened," he said. "I helped you before, so you need to help me now."

"I risked my entire future with the Patrol Team. You can't forget what you promised, can you?"

After a long silence, True Person Rising Sun let out a small sigh of relief.

The other party agreed to give him another sum of money and told him to lie low for a while. They promised to provide the promised job and position in the future, but not yet — doing so now would attract too much attention.

Though True Person Rising Sun knew they were right, the thought of working at the Vocational College still filled him with anxiety and uncertainty.

In Bei Wufeng's laboratory, where he was overseeing an experiment, a notification flashed across his Bionic Eye. It was a message from Jin Jun.

Jin Jun: Senior Brother, have you heard about what happened with Zhang Yu?

Bei Wufeng: I've been busy with the school's training program lately. Just get to the point.

Jin Jun: Zhang Yu got into a conflict with students from Celestial Monsters University at a construction site.

Jin Jun: He reported them, and they were arrested for environmental pollution.

Jin Jun: The Celestial Monsters University students are currently detained, and many monsterfolk are protesting.

Bei Wufeng read Jin Jun's messages and saw that many monsterfolk were chanting slogans about discrimination against their kind and biased law enforcement.

"Selective enforcement! When will the discrimination against monsterfolk end?"

"We monsterfolk at Celestial Monsters University have no concept of environmental protection. It's part of our cultural heritage and ancestral customs..."

"Zhang Yu also used violence! Why isn't he arrested? Why only Xiang Shan?"

Unconsciously, Bei Wufeng paused his experiment, watching the news with growing interest. He never imagined his Junior Brother would provoke such a major conflict with the monsterfolk.

He checked Zhang Yu's social media account and found it had been overrun by monsterfolk. Hundreds of comments, each accompanied by animal avatars, were attacking him.

Jin Jun sent a message: "I heard Zhang Yu has been blacklisted by many monsterfolk."

Jin Jun: "Many believe Zhang Yu's actions are jeopardizing the cooperation between Myriad Laws and the Celestial Monsters."

Jin Jun: "Senior Brother, should we take advantage of this situation?"

Bei Wufeng, who had been cheerfully reading the news, suddenly frowned at Jin Jun's message. He replied: "Junior Brother, your thinking is flawed."

Bei Wufeng: "Even though Zhang Yu is my rival, he's still one of us from the Artifact Refinement Department. We can settle our differences behind closed doors."

Bei Wufeng: "But when he's publicly clashing with monsters — especially Civil Engineering monsters [vomit emoji] — how can we undermine him? What would others think of us?"

Bei Wufeng: "Your perspective needs broadening."

As a Human Race Immortal Daoist, Bei Wufeng had long harbored disdain for the monsterfolk from Celestial Monsters University. He deeply resented the Finance Department's strategies to curry favor with the university.

Bei Wufeng knew the situation was beyond his control. All three Soul Transformation cultivators supported the plan, so he kept his thoughts to himself, always greeting the monsterfolk with a smile. In his Bionic Eye, he marked them as priority targets and applied a "humanization patch" to avoid discomfort from prolonged exposure.

Of course, another crucial reason Bei Wufeng didn't kick Zhang Yu was that he didn't perceive him as a threat, nor did he believe Zhang Yu could ever replace him on the school team.

Bei Wufeng simply liked Zhang Yu's social media post before returning to his experiments.

While the monsterfolk were causing a massive uproar online, Zhang Yu paid little attention.

After all, compared to the monsterfolk, he was far more concerned about who was behind True Person Rising Sun.

In True Monarch Magnetic Pole's laboratory, Zhang Yu said to his teacher, "Master, I've caused you trouble this time."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied dismissively, "If it wasn't this problem, another would have arisen elsewhere."

She sneered coldly and said slowly, "Some people will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. Now that they know my Soul Transformation Bionic project has yielded results, they're no longer content to sit still."

"Next time something like this happens, report it to me immediately. Don't wait until you're on your way back to tell me, like you did this time."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole believed this incident was inevitably connected to her review of Soul Transformation and the Soul Transformation Bionic project.

But just then, Zhang Yu spoke up. "Master, the root cause of this incident lies with me. If I hadn't gotten involved with the Dual Rest Cult while investigating Junior College Students, none of this trouble would have arisen."

As he spoke, he handed Shui Haiyu's recording to True Monarch Magnetic Pole. "Master, I suspect this incident may genuinely be related to the Demonic Sect."

After skimming through the recording, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's brow twitched slightly, but she said nothing specific, merely nodding. "I understand. Don't mention this to anyone else for now. I'll look into it myself."
