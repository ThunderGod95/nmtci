# Chapter 739: The Heavenly Court Descends

"Sis, I'm counting on you," Zhang Yu said calmly. "Without you, I couldn't have achieved this."

Zhang Pianpian sighed. "Hacking the divine power network is nothing. Right now, across the entire Second to Fifth Layers, you're the only one who could borrow this much money."

One billion... Ten billion...

Move Mountain Talisman! Divine Power Talisman! Heaven Overturning Talisman!

As talisman after talisman descended, beams of divine light enveloped Zhang Yu's body, pouring incomparably violent power into him. His every movement, every breath, now triggered a hurricane.

Thirty billion... Forty billion... Fifty billion!

Heaven Manipulation Talisman! Weather Control Talisman! Endless Magic Power Talisman! Infinite Spiritual Energy Talisman! Earth Shifting Talisman!

At this moment, all the spiritual energy of the Fifth Layer seemed to converge upon Zhang Yu.

Countless astral winds raged across the sky, sweeping toward the firmament.

With a deafening roar, in a region untouched by the Stars Filling the Sky Great Formation, the earth began to warp at Zhang Yu's will. It transformed into pairs of colossal hands that soared upward, piercing straight into the heavens.

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus of the Righteous Qi Alliance watched silently, marveling inwardly, "A single thought shatters heaven and earth."

Seventy billion!

Eighty billion!

One hundred billion!

Cross-Layer Divine Power Talisman! Myriad Laws-at-Will Talisman! Great God Possession Talisman!

A series of explosive cracks echoed around Zhang Yu as the divine power network overloaded from transmitting such immense power.

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu's Spirit Realm Authority, Talisman Authority, and Divine Power Network Authority surged wildly.

The Second, Third, and Fourth Layers trembled in unison as their divine power networks churned, funneling power toward Zhang Yu on the Fifth Layer.

In this moment, Zhang Yu recalled the time he had been subjected to the talismans of the Great God of Sentient Creation. The sensation was similar but thousands, even tens of thousands of times more intense.

Zhang Yu's body swelled abruptly, transforming into a giant hundreds of meters tall. He soared into the sky, wreathed in countless beams of divine light, and unleashed a devastating punch toward the firmament.

If the descending firmament had already been pushed to its limit by the resistance of numerous Soul Transformation cultivators and the modifications of the Stars Filling the Sky Great Formation, then Zhang Yu's strike, fueled by ten billion spirit coins' worth of divine power, completely reversed the tide.

Amidst thunderous rumbles, all cultivators on the Fifth Layer felt the entire world tremble violently. The firmament, which had been gradually descending, was forcefully pushed back up.

True Monarch Junior College stared in awe, stammering, "God... God... God... Zhang Yu is now the Righteous God with the highest authority below the Fifth Layer!"

"Heaven, earth, and all living beings hold no secrets from him. The myriad things of the world are under his control. Overturning heaven and earth is but a single thought away!"

In response to Zhang Yu's strike, Fu Xiantian's face gradually materialized in the firmament.

One held up the heavens, the other suppressed them. Their gazes clashed, burning with boundless battle intent and fighting spirit.

Fu Xiantian sighed, "You'd incur a debt of a hundred billion to stop me? Only you would think of such a thing."

Zhang Yu retorted, "This isn't money — it's resolve! Fu Xiantian! This is the damn resolve of everyone from the Second to the Fifth Layer to survive!"

With another deafening roar, Chang Buxiu stared at the sky and shouted excitedly, "It's going up! The heavens are being pushed back up!"

Fu Xiantian said coldly, "A mistaken resolve is meaningless. What value is there in a twisted survival?"

"Zhang Yu, now feel our resolve."

As he spoke, the several Reincarnation Avatars under his control descended from the firmament. Each cast the Reincarnation Soul-Washing Scripture, pointing a finger toward Zhang Yu.

In an instant, Zhang Yu's mind plunged into chaos as countless memories surged forth.

He remembered being betrayed repeatedly in his sect, insulted by his mother, forcibly cultivated by his brothers, and devoured until nothing but a husk remained...

"This isn't me!"

*Roar!* With a furious shout, a bestial shadow leaped from Zhang Yu's body, only to be seized by his massive hand.

As Zhang Yu tore at it with immense force, the Monsterfolk Clone screamed with the pain of rending flesh and bone before being utterly shredded to pieces.

Just like that, the Demon Beast Clone, infused with Reincarnation memories, was directly killed by Zhang Yu.

Immediately, another memory surfaced. Zhang Yu remembered being skinned and having his bones pulled out by his own disciple in the sect, forced to watch as he was eaten piece by piece.

"I told you, this isn't me!"

With a furious roar, Zhang Yu brutally tore another bestial shadow to shreds.

But immediately, more memories flooded his mind.

Zhang Yu remembered his family turning on each other for a single job — father and son killing each other, husband and wife murdering each other, children and grandchildren betraying their elders. In the end, he was the sole survivor, yet still failed the interview.

He remembered cultivating diligently, barely passing the assessments and interview, only to be forced to give up his position to someone else. He was driven to bankruptcy, trodden underfoot, and forced to admit to everyone that he was a pauper, unworthy of the job...

Scene after scene flashed through his mind, but with each one, Zhang Yu tore apart another of his clones, enduring the excruciating pain of shattered bones and shredded flesh.

As he repeatedly annihilated himself in this way, his hands had already pushed the firmament upward by a full hundred meters.

"Fu Xiantian! Don't use your memories, your experiences, to decide our future!"

"None of this is me! It's not my Master, not my companions, not my classmates, not my colleagues!"

Amidst his furious roar, Zhang Yu had already violently obliterated the final Demon Beast Clone.

*Bang!*

The firmament was once again pushed back by another hundred meters. At the same time, the few Reincarnation Avatars of Fu Xiantian, due to the overloaded operation of the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture, had their divine souls shatter and were completely absorbed by the firmament.

Fu Xiantian's voice echoed coldly, "That is your future. Do you truly believe you can resist the influence of the Heavenly Court? That you can defy the Immortal Emperor's arrangements? To continue living is to walk the wrong path."

Zhang Yu pressed his hands desperately against the firmament, spitting out each word, "Wrong? Look closely at the living people below! They want to live! They just want a job! They just want to live a decent life! What have they done wrong?!"

Fu Xiantian didn't answer. Instead, the sky began to crack, and a terrifying force descended, crushing down on Zhang Yu with insane pressure.

"This is..." Zhang Yu's expression changed drastically as he felt an irresistible force dragging him downward.

Simultaneously, the Sky Pillars rising from the Stars Filling the Sky Great Formation began to shatter, one after another.

Within the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation, the divine light erupting from the many Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, who had just been fighting together, rapidly dimmed as they found themselves unable to hold on any longer.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus stared at the shattering firmament, her voice a mixture of shock and fury. "He's insane... He self-destructed the Great Annihilation Final Vista Mystic Seal! That bastard won't even remain an artifact spirit!"

Divine Monarch Nether Spring spoke with chilling coldness, "He intends to drag everyone down with him."

Under the crushing pressure of the collapsing sky, whether it was Zhang Yu, Stars Filling the Sky Great Formation or the Soul Transformation cultivators from the Ten Universities and the Righteous Qi Alliance, all were steadily losing ground.

Faced with the self-destruction of this Sect-Guarding Magical Artifact, it seemed no one in the world could stop it.

Fu Xiantian's face, which had appeared in the firmament, also began to crack. He looked at Zhang Yu and said, "You cannot stop the Heaven Collapse. Come with me to the New World."

Zhang Yu stared back at Fu Xiantian. "Fu Xiantian, I used to hate Kunxu too. I despised everything about the Kunxu People..."

"But recently, I've realized something."

"The Kunxu People... if you pay them, they'll charge forward."

"Give them a job, and they'll risk their lives for it."

"Show them how to make money, and they'll trust you, willing to bet everything they have."

"So, are the Kunxu People themselves at fault, or are those who twisted them into this state the ones to blame?"

Fu Xiantian replied indifferently, "Weakness is the only sin. The weak can only change, can only find their own way out. This is the natural law of Kunxu."

Just then, Bai Zhenzhen, wielding the Emotion Heaven Sword, slashed toward the firmament.

Fu Xiantian, now just a blurry silhouette, snorted coldly. "Just like that. The weak can only lose, can only flee. Don't you understand yet?"

As the sword qi collided with the firmament, Bai Zhenzhen, covered in blood, plummeted downward.

But it was as if a switch had been flipped. Soon, True Monarch Starfire also soared into the sky, charging toward the firmament.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter shouted, "Go, Myriad Hands! We can't let Zhang Yu lose, or who will pay back our debts?!"

Chang Buxiu activated the Great Void Cloud Repository and yelled, "Everyone! We can't let True Monarch Blazing Light fall!"

"I want to live!"

"I want to keep making money!"

Meanwhile, within the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation...

"Damn it... You think you're the only one who can self-destruct?" Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole cursed. "Everyone, whether we go bankrupt or not depends on this! Let's blow up with him!"

As she spoke, Heavenly Sun Radiance God was the first to soar into the sky, crashing into the firmament like a Great Sun, erupting in blindingly intense light.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus gave a bitter smile and silently guided his magical artifact upward.

At the same time, countless red dots appeared on the ground.

Seeing these red dots, which resembled flickering flames, Fu Xiantian paused for a moment. Then he realized they were countless Fists, Blazing Lights, and flames, all surging toward the sky.

Many red dots remained on the ground. Fu Xiantian glanced down and saw a massive number of monsterfolk breeding, creating Demon Beasts, and then desperately modifying the great formation.

"For True Monarch Blazing Light, everyone, breed like your lives depend on it!"

Thinking about how these people were first showered with money by Zhang Yu, then borrowed from him, and now charged forward for his victory, Fu Xiantian couldn't help but sigh. "Not ten billion, not twenty billion... You've leveraged at least thirty billion Spirit Coins' worth of power against me."

"Zhang Yu, you truly are worthy of Master's attention."

"Fu Xiantian!" As his divine power shattered, Zhang Yu once again pushed against the firmament, roaring, "Did you see that? This is the determination of everyone who wants to live..."

"Opposing you is the choice of the entire world, the entire realm, of all living beings."

Fu Xiantian replied coldly, "So what? You won't be able to hold on for much longer."

Under the assault of countless people, the firmament's descent slowed slightly. But soon, many Cultivators could no longer sustain their efforts and plummeted back to the earth. The firmament's descent accelerated once more.

Fu Xiantian said faintly, "This is how Kunxu works. The strongest decides everything. The rest... even if they all unite, it's meaningless."

"Today, I will exterminate all life and create a New World."

Amidst the violent tremors, the soaring red dots and sparks fell like meteors, crashing back to the ground one by one.

At this moment, Fu Xiantian was the strongest in this realm, blasting away everything that stood in his way with unshakable power.

"It's finally over..."

Just as Fu Xiantian sighed inwardly, a crack spanning a thousand miles suddenly appeared in the sky.

Watching this scene, Zhang Yu sighed softly. "It's finally here."

Fu Xiantian's heart jolted. Staring at the crack in the sky, he demanded, "You summoned the Heavenly Court?"

Zhang Yu replied, "It wasn't me. It was the Ten Billion Spirit Coins."

In an instant, Fu Xiantian understood. The divine power network, boiling and surging after being infused with Ten Billion Spirit Coins, had become like a lighthouse set ablaze, its boundless brilliance illuminating the path through the darkness. It had accelerated the Heavenly Court's search and descent, drawing those greedy Righteous Gods toward it as swiftly as flies to filth.

The next moment, the sky was torn in half, and a pair of eyes spanning thousands of miles peered down from the rift.

The Heavenly Court had arrived.

Author Note: The University War Ends, the Heavenly Court Descends

With the descent of the Heavenly Court, the University War has officially concluded. Now, it's time to wrap things up and set the stage for the next arc.

Forged in the fires of war, Zhang Yu has grown further in both strength and character compared to his high school and university days. He has also gradually gained greater influence over the entire Kunxu World.

From the start of the Ten Greats League to the end of the University War, Zhang Yu has transitioned from someone shaped by the world to someone who mutually influences it.

Telling this story — of a protagonist who grows step by step in the Kunxu World, constantly changed and tempered, until he ultimately begins to reshape the world itself — is the central theme of Cultivating Immortality Without Money.

I want to extend my deepest gratitude to all the readers who have followed the story this far. Your support lets me know I'm not alone and that my ideas are resonating with you through the internet.

However, I must apologize to everyone, as I need to take a day off.

Since taking a day off on Lunar New Year's Day last year, my goal has been to maintain daily updates until the novel is finished, accompanying you all each day with reasonably interesting content.

But now, it seems that's becoming difficult to achieve.

Although I've had practice from writing several previous books and was mentally prepared for the story of Kunxu to become progressively harder to write — with the difficulty growing exponentially as the plot progressed — I've found myself running out of time like never before over the past two months while writing the University War arc.

My daily writing process starts after posting the noon update. I begin by organizing the main outline and my inspirations, then write a detailed outline for the next day's chapter. After that, I fill in the content, write the main text, and then think about where I can add some cyberpunk-style humor or check for anything that doesn't fit the book's overall tone.

Because this book's setting is quite complex, and perhaps because I'm getting older, the entire process takes a long time. This has been especially true over the last two months as the plot has expanded. Having pushed myself to this point — the end of the University War and the descent of the Heavenly Court — I feel I've reached my limit.

The upcoming chapters are especially crucial. Whether it's Zhang Yu's growth, the changes in Bai Zhenzhen and Yu Xinghan, the evolution of the entire world, the progression of the main plot, or the gradual emergence of sects and Immortals — all of this requires me to spend more time deliberating and organizing the outline.

Therefore, I need to take a day off. I sincerely apologize to everyone again.
