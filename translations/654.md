# Chapter 654: The Strongest Undergraduate

Myriad Laws University.

Students were simultaneously studying, working, and watching the final battle between Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing.

For many students, observing this battle itself was a form of learning.

In a classroom, Gongshu Jin watched the footage of Zhang Yu through his Bionic Eye, silently wondering, "Can Zhang Yu win?"

At the construction site on the 671st floor, the footage of the final battle between Zhang Yu, the former Civil Engineering Student, was projected directly onto the wall.

Shi Huaiyu watched the battle with a flushed face, her Bionic Eye constantly refreshing the price fluctuations of Myriad Laws Coins and stock prices. She mentally screamed, "Go, Zhang Yu! Recover all the coin value lost after Dao Qiankun's death!"

Meanwhile, in the Civil Engineering Department office, Director Gao was also watching the battle between Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing.

Throughout the fight, he continuously sent updates on the battlefield's developments to True Monarch Magnetic Pole, who was in seclusion, including screenshots and text summaries.

Although True Monarch Magnetic Pole remained unresponsive, Director Gao hoped that upon emerging from seclusion, she would immediately see the news of Zhang Yu's performance in the Ten Greats League.

Director Gao: Zhang Yu has successfully deployed his formation. Kuang Tianqing has begun dismantling it...

Director Gao: Their Golden Cores have been exhausted. They've both replaced them with new ones...

Director Gao: Another Core exchange...

Director Gao: Zhang Yu's dragon beasts are depleted...

Director Gao: Kuang Tianqing's dual cultivation power seems to be running out...

Tu Lishan, watching the live broadcast, sighed, "They've been fighting fiercely for nearly ten hours. I never imagined Zhang Yu could reach this point."

"It's been less than two months since the Ten Greats League began, yet he's already caught up to Kuang Tianqing's level?"

Director Gao sat beside him, watching intently. "His progress in these two months has been truly remarkable," he said.

"The Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor refined by Magnetic Pole allows him to rapidly transform the environment. His dragon beasts not only aid in battle but also assist with construction. This ten-hour battle, with its constant construction and destruction of great formations, has drained a significant portion of Kuang Tianqing's energy."

Director Gao remained unaware that Zhang Yu had also been cultivating the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture, a black art. In his view, Zhang Yu simply possessed extraordinary talent in controlling and breeding Demon Beasts, his command of them flawless in every battle.

"He also has the Seven Absolutes Bionic, modified by seven Nascent Soul experts from the Artifact Refinement Department. It not only enhances his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power but also includes a technique that combines other military-grade powers to fuel an Immortal Dao Sun."

"This Immortal Dao Sun seems to have evolved further. After being miniaturized for practical use, it can be deployed more frequently, yet its destructive force remains potent enough to threaten Kuang Tianqing."

"Moreover, with Principal's support, he recently mastered the Shattered Core Technique. Though it's only at the tenth-level and not as refined as Kuang Tianqing's, it's already at the Foundation Establishment level, sufficient to challenge her in battle..."

Tu Lishan added from the side, "But the sword is still the most crucial factor."

Tu Lishan gazed enviously at the coiled longsword in Zhang Yu's hand. "Even with Zhang Yu's inherent abilities, he'd likely still fall short against Kuang Tianqing."

"But this sword... it's essentially the culmination of all the resources of Heavenly Sword University's top genius. Her entire cultivation, Bionic, and Divine Spiritual Root have been forged into this blade, imbuing it with the devastating power of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"With the sword in hand, Zhang Yu's overall combat prowess has undergone a complete transformation."

"This coiled longsword allows him to threaten Kuang Tianqing with every strike, capable of breaking through the Heavenly Demon Void Technique, the Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art, and the Cursed Heaven Myriad Demon Throne. Though still significantly weakened, his attacks can now at least wound Kuang Tianqing..."

Though Tu Lishan outwardly envied the destructive power and enhanced strength granted by the coiled longsword, he knew his envy extended beyond the sword's intrinsic value.

What he truly envied, it seemed, was that Zhang Yu had someone willing to sacrifice so much for him.

Tu Lishan couldn't help but wonder, "What exactly did Zhang Yu do to Bai Zhenzhen? Did he borrow a fortune in Spirit Coins? Has he been giving her free dual cultivation sessions? Or is Bai Zhenzhen his daughter? Is she his father's or mother's child? But the ages don't match up..."

No matter how hard he pondered, Tu Lishan couldn't make sense of it.

Director Gao listened to Tu Lishan's analysis without comment.

He recalled his past warnings to Zhang Yu, urging him to stay away from Bai Zhenzhen, to avoid that madwoman who cultivated the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao.

Yet, during this Ten Greats League, Bai Zhenzhen displayed extraordinary strength. She not only pushed the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao to its peak, reaching a level that threatened Kuang Tianqing, but also made the ultimate sacrifice, transforming her body into a sword to aid Zhang Yu in securing victory.

When the pair entered the battlefield together, a mysterious reaction seemed to occur. Zhang Yu's own strength surged, and the endurance of his Extreme Emotion Sword Qi increased exponentially.

Director Gao's expression was complex as he thought to himself, "To wager her life to help Zhang Yu win... their bond runs deeper than I imagined."

"Especially after the Human-Sword union. Beyond the destructive power of the Extreme Emotion Sword Qi, their combined combat prowess has skyrocketed. I fear..."

Director Gao remained unaware of the truth: Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had exchanged Spiritual Roots. Now, their Dual Spiritual Roots had merged into a single entity when Zhang Yu wielded the sword, constantly influencing and amplifying each other. He also didn't know that the Feather Spirit Root and True Spirit Root were simultaneously enhancing the effects of Zhang Yu's Chain Formation Diagram Set.

Thus, from Director Gao's perspective...

"Could it be... that Bai Zhenzhen isn't the only one cultivating the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao?" Director Gao wondered inwardly. "Is Zhang Yu also secretly practicing it? Is that why their Dual Swords Harmonization is so powerful? Is this part of Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' scheme?"

The thought filled Director Gao with a sense of helplessness.

Just then, Kuang Tianqing's aura in the live broadcast surged violently, instantly approaching the Golden Core realm. She detonated her Golden Core and physical body, unleashing a supreme strike against Zhang Yu.

Director Gao's gaze sharpened as he watched. "A true life-or-death attack," he murmured.

"Detonating both Golden Core and physical body — this technique perfectly complements the Netherworld Disintegration Technique for offense."

"Kuang Tianqing's experience in this area far surpasses Zhang Yu's. By using this as her final move, she's dragged him into her domain of expertise."

"After ten hours of relentless combat, she's been waiting for this very moment."

"Even if Zhang Yu risks his life and detonates himself in retaliation, he can't possibly match Kuang Tianqing's seasoned mastery of this technique."

As Director Gao watched, he couldn't help but wonder: "How will Zhang Yu defend against this?"

---

On the battlefield, Zhang Yu watched Kuang Tianqing charge toward him with unprecedented calm.

For some reason, he recalled a conversation he'd had with Lady Fortune after replicating Dao Qiankun's Dao Seed.

Having gained the power of an Immortal Descendant and possessing spatial abilities, Zhang Yu was astonished.

Since arriving in Kunxu, he had never encountered any applications of Immortal Dao Technology related to space.

No Storage Rings, no Storage Magical Artifacts, no Spatial Attacks, no Spatial Distortions... Zhang Yu had seen none of these.

Wait... Zhang Yu suddenly remembered. He had seen it once.

The transition from Kunxu's First Layer to the Second Layer involved a dramatic spatial shift, and the underlying technology must have been related to space.

But that was all. He had never encountered spatial powers at Myriad Laws University, nor had he found any place to study them.

"Spatial technology must be incredibly advanced," Zhang Yu thought. "If it were to become widely disseminated, the world would likely undergo another massive transformation."

After obtaining the power of the Immortal Descendant and mastering the ability to create 10-cubic-meter spaces, Zhang Yu felt a sense of confusion.

This feeling intensified as he sensed the information within the Dao Seed, leaving him even more hesitant.

That's why he turned to Lady Fortune.

"Lady Fortune, if you possessed the ability to create spaces, how do you think it should be used within Kunxu?" Zhang Yu asked.

Hearing Zhang Yu's question, Lady Fortune casually replied, "Are you joking? To tamper with Kunxu's spatial structure, what level of authority and status would one need?"

Zhang Yu's heart stirred. "What level?" he pressed.

Lady Fortune scoffed. "Stop daydreaming. Kunxu's 36 layers were designed and built by the Immortals themselves. They're fixed. Do you think they'd let anyone mess with them?"

"Theoretically, all the spaces within Kunxu belong to the Immortals. They're just letting you use them for free. Do you think they'd let you carve them up and remodel them however you please?"

"If that were allowed, I bet within a few years, corporations would have turned Kunxu into 365 layers or more..."

Hearing Lady Fortune's reply, Zhang Yu knew his hesitation had been justified. He thought to himself, "As expected, the spatial abilities of the Immortal Descendants cannot be used lightly. If discovered, it would inevitably lead to trouble."

"The ten cubic meters of space that an Immortal Descendant can create, along with the thirty square centimeters... roughly the size of a fist... that's the opening..."

Zhang Yu sensed the information within the Dao Seed and mused, "These parameters are designed to prevent easy detection of changes in the spatial structure, to guard against spatial probing."

"To safely create larger spaces and wider openings, I need to enhance the Immortal Descendant's Dao Seed and gain greater Spatial Authority."

Zhang Yu suddenly realized that the Immortal Descendant's ability wasn't just about creating space, but about creating space covertly. This concealment was crucial.

With this realization, another question arose in Zhang Yu's mind.

He asked, "Lady Fortune, if that's the case, is manipulating space... the domain of Immortals? Is it something only Immortals can achieve?"

Lady Fortune replied, "A very few Immortal Sect Techniques might also allow it."

Zhang Yu asked, "What about the Immortal's... disciples? Descendants? Could Immortal Descendants achieve this?"

Lady Fortune chuckled. "Learning Immortal Sect Techniques would allow it, though obtaining such techniques would be exceedingly difficult."

Zhang Yu pressed, "Can't Immortal Descendants achieve it directly? Like inheriting a portion of the Immortal's Spatial Authority or abilities..."

Lady Fortune shook her head. "I've never heard of such a thing. But if bloodline power truly granted control over space, that would be absurd."

"Such Immortal Descendants would be born with innate talents for smuggling, illegal immigration, and tax evasion! They'd be criminal geniuses!"

"It would be a miracle if such individuals could resist committing crimes. Wouldn't Immortals fear their descendants plunging Kunxu into chaos?"

"If they actually did that, other Immortals would surely object. They'd likely oppose it."

As Lady Fortune spoke, the image of Dao Qiankun flashed through Zhang Yu's mind. The Heavenly Chosen of Myriad Laws University seemed far more complex than he had previously imagined.

Through sensing the Dao Seed's information and discussing it with Lady Fortune, Zhang Yu grew even more reluctant to reveal his Immortal Descendant abilities.

This was merely Zhang Yu's perspective. He desperately wanted to remain undetected and worked tirelessly to achieve this. Ultimately, however, the outcome was beyond his complete control, leaving him to do his best and trust in fate.

For cultivators without spatial abilities, detecting changes in spatial structures was inherently difficult.

"Moreover, the Immortal Descendant chose this specific size because, given their current Spatial Authority, spatial distortions of this scale are the least likely to be noticed. It's designed to prevent spatial detection."

"In contrast, visual changes might be more easily detected."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "For example, if someone directly sees me sending objects into the spatial realm, even a fool would realize something's amiss."

"Especially during my final battle against Kuang Tianqing, countless people are watching the live broadcast. This battle will likely be replayed endlessly in the future, making visual concealment absolutely crucial."

"So, if I want to use the Immortal Descendant's abilities during the final battle..."

"The moment had arrived."

On the battlefield, Zhang Yu locked eyes with Kuang Tianqing.

As Kuang Tianqing unleashed her desperate strike, a tempestuous gale erupted, and a surging shockwave exploded outward with each of her movements.

The shattered radiance of her Golden Core soared skyward, like a sun igniting on the horizon, its incandescent light searing Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

Though Zhang Yu had resolved to harness the power of the Immortal Descendant, he knew this single ability alone would be insufficient.

Kuang Tianqing's attack would inevitably be earth-shattering, its destructive range engulfing Zhang Yu completely.

To believe that a mere 30 square centimeters — a space no larger than a fist — could completely block such an assault was sheer fantasy.

"The Immortal Descendant is an excellent support," Zhang Yu mused inwardly. "But whether to protect the Immortal Descendant or to utterly defeat Kuang Tianqing, I cannot rely solely on it..."

Facing Kuang Tianqing's desperate onslaught, Zhang Yu needed to mobilize every asset, every ounce of strength, and every fiber of his spirit.

"Kuang Tianqing, do you think you've dragged me onto your battlefield?"

"You're wrong, Kuang Tianqing. Pushing myself to the limit... that's my specialty."

The light of a shattering Golden Core erupted from Zhang Yu's body.

Then a second! A third! A fourth!

Four Golden Cores shattered in succession, blinding golden light tearing through Zhang Yu's body as if to rip him apart.

The tangible force of the Shattered Cores surged from within Zhang Yu, enveloping him like flames and propelling him forward.

"Come, Kuang Tianqing."

"Let this final strike decide the victor of this battle."

The audience watched in stunned disbelief.

Ye Xingli was utterly shaken. "Four Golden Cores shattered consecutively? That requires multitasking on an unimaginable scale — simultaneously controlling four Golden Core breakthroughs, four Shattered Cores... What kind of computational power and control does he possess?"

Nine Heavens Liu's eyes gleamed with strange light as he observed the scene. "The backlash from a Fourth Layer Shattered Core... can his physical body truly withstand it? Isn't this no different from self-destruction?"

Shattering a Golden Core inevitably carries severe consequences.

Each instance of shattering a Golden Core during a breakthrough inflicts catastrophic damage on the body's flesh, meridians, bones, Dantian, Spiritual Root...

In ancient times, if a Foundation Establishment cultivator failed to break through to the Golden Core stage, it was a life-or-death calamity. Severe injuries could permanently halt their cultivation progress.

Even in the modern Kunxu environment, only the strongest Foundation Establishment cultivators like Kuang Tianqing and Zhang Yu could repeatedly shatter their Golden Cores in succession.

But shattering one core at a time was fundamentally different from shattering four in a single breath.

*Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!*

The explosive sounds erupted as Zhang Yu's flesh and blood suddenly burst apart, revealing fragments of fractured white bone and ruptured organs.

The power of the four layers Shattered Core surged through the Seven Absolutes Bionic. The Bionic Eye flashed with a barrage of warning messages: "Bionic nearing critical limit," "Overheating," "Severe overload," "Durability critically low," and more.

"Immortal Dao Sun! Show yourself!"

Driven to his absolute limit, Zhang Yu unleashed the most powerful technique of his life, creating a second sun that blazed across the battlefield.

Watching his opponent unleash such a formidable attack, Kuang Tianqing felt no respect, admiration, excitement, or satisfaction.

Only rage. A burning fury surged through her heart.

"Damn it... After fighting this hard, how can you still be so strong?"

"Why must you be this powerful? Why must you stop me from reaching the pinnacle? From extending the lifespan of the world?!"

Kuang Tianqing channeled her fury to amplify her final strike, pouring every ounce of her remaining strength into the attack.

"Then let's die together!" Kuang Tianqing roared. "Let's see who falls first!"

Like two suns colliding, a blinding radiance engulfed both combatants and the entire battlefield.

In that moment, both Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing understood perfectly: against this life-or-death opponent, victory would be determined by who died first.

Facing the explosion of the Immortal Dao Sun and the scorching heat and shockwaves from their colliding forces, Zhang Yu's body sustained catastrophic damage.

After all, the Immortal Dao Sun's explosion was inherently self-destructive. Now, amplified by the four layers Shattered Core Technique and colliding head-on with Kuang Tianqing's desperate strike, the resulting cataclysm threatened to obliterate everything.

Zhang Yu's blood mist evaporated instantly, and his Seven Absolutes Bionics began to malfunction one by one.

For the first time, Zhang Yu felt his Civil Engineering Holy Body reaching its limit, teetering on the brink of death.

At that moment, a pure white sword qi surged forth.

"Yu Zi!" Bai Zhenzhen's ethereal form materialized behind Zhang Yu, her hand joining his on the sword hilt. "Follow my instincts," she urged. "Let's strike together."

Gathering his last reserves of strength, Zhang Yu channeled his ultimate sword qi. Dragging his battered body, he followed Bai Zhenzhen's guidance, unleashing a soaring slash. The white sword qi cleaved through the chaotic currents before him, as if slicing apart the two suns dominating the battlefield inch by inch.

With this soaring strike, Zhang Yu achieved human-sword unity, his entire being transforming into a living blade piercing forward.

This posture allowed him to shield himself from the shockwave, his hand leading the charge, his head and torso aligned in a straight line behind his arm.

As the coiled sword cleaved through the shockwave, weakening the incoming explosion, a spatial rift opened on the back of Zhang Yu's sword-wielding hand. Amidst the blinding light and earth-shattering blast, a fist-sized spatial aperture continuously devoured the encroaching shockwave.

Yet this absorption seemed utterly insignificant against the cataclysmic explosion, a mere speck against the overwhelming force.

In this situation, Zhang Yu's head and torso, hidden behind the sword and his hands, experienced significantly reduced pressure.

However, neither the coiled sword's assistance, the Immortal Descendant's protection, nor Zhang Yu's efforts to shrink his body and evade the aftershocks could completely block the explosion.

He could only fight with all his might, endure, and struggle, burning his life force to its very end.

Crack! Cracks gradually appeared on the coiled sword's blade.

"A-Zhen!" Zhang Yu exclaimed inwardly, instinctively trying to retract the sword.

Bai Zhenzhen's phantom abruptly embraced him. "Yu Zi! Hold on! Don't worry about me!"

Zhang Yu took a deep breath. "A-Zhen..."

Only a few moments had passed since their final clash, yet time seemed to slow to a standstill for Zhang Yu.

Watching the coiled sword shatter inch by inch and feeling his life force gradually extinguish, Zhang Yu's heart surged with intense resentment and fury.

"Why? Why hasn't a victor been decided yet?"

"Is Kuang Tianqing still alive?"

"Why can't she die?!"

At that very moment, within Kuang Tianqing's abdomen, a tiny body was wailing.

"Zhang Yu! Why aren't you dead yet?!"

Shortly after detonating her Golden Core and physical body, Kuang Tianqing transferred her consciousness into a Demonic Fetus gestating within her abdomen.

This Demonic Fetus would only be destroyed when her original body had completely evaporated.

But now, with over half of her original body already vaporized and the battle still undecided, Kuang Tianqing felt an overwhelming sense of anxiety and tension.

When more than eighty percent of her body had evaporated, unease surged through her heart.

As ninety-nine percent of her body was vaporized and the Demonic Fetus was exposed to the full force of the explosion, an unprecedented wave of resentment and indignation flooded her mind.

All these mental shifts occurred within the brief moments of their final clash.

All her power had been exhausted, all her Bionics and magical artifacts had been destroyed, and Kuang Tianqing's life was nearing its end.

"Damn it!"

"Why?! Why aren't you dead yet, even after enduring this much?!"

"I sacrificed everything! I represent the will of the heavens! Why... why..."

In the next instant, searing light completely engulfed the Demonic Fetus.

---

When Zhang Yu regained consciousness, he found himself standing on scorched earth, thick smoke billowing into the sky and completely obscuring his vision.

Bai Zhenzhen's ethereal form materialized beside him, smiling. "Yu Zi! We won."

Zhang Yu's heart jolted as memories of the moment before his near-death experience flooded back.

In that final instant, a layer of divine light had suddenly descended, shielding a ten-meter radius around him and blocking all the residual shockwaves from the battle.

Immediately afterward, streams of healing talismans had poured down upon him, preserving his life.

"Did Kuang Tianqing die first?" Zhang Yu wondered inwardly. "I became the champion, won the match, so my life was spared."

"Did they think it would be too embarrassing for the champion of the Ten Greats League to die?"

Just then, ten beams of divine light sequentially illuminated the surrounding area.

Zhang Yu looked up and saw a dense array of titles shimmering within the divine light, flashing before his eyes.

These ten beams represented the ten Soul Transformation principals of the Ten Great Universities.

Behind these ten beams, the projection of a Righteous God descended from the heavens, transcending the Spirit Realm to project its image into the atmosphere.

"Congratulations, Zhang Yu."

Zhang Yu's heart skipped a beat when he saw the Righteous God. Above the deity's head, the words "Great God of Sentient Creation" were clearly displayed.

This Great God was the foremost deity of the Ministry of All People among the Eight Righteous Gods, and the only Righteous God Zhang Yu had ever worshipped using a talisman.

The Great God of Sentient Creation smiled gently at Zhang Yu. "You won the finals and became the champion of this year's Ten Greats League, the strongest undergraduate among the Ten Greats."

"The award ceremony will be held tomorrow, and the Dao Repository Catalog will be formally revealed at the ceremony."

"At that time, you may choose any cultivation art from the Dao Repository Catalog as your champion's reward."

The Great God from the Heavenly Court chuckled. "However, your current condition is not ideal..."

From within the divine light representing Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution of Myriad Laws University, a voice echoed: "Within a day, Myriad Laws University will completely restore Zhang Yu's body and Bionic."

The Great God of Sentient Creation nodded with a smile, then shook his head. "I fear that at this very moment, many Evil Cults, Evil Gods, and those with ulterior motives are already plotting something sinister."

"We must ensure the champion's safety within this 24-hour period."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution declared, "Myriad Laws University will spare no effort to guarantee Zhang Yu's safety."

The Great God of Sentient Creation said calmly, "Celestial Evolution, it's not that I distrust the capabilities of Myriad Laws, but the awards ceremony must proceed without incident. For the next 24 hours..."

The Great God glanced at Zhang Yu, and in the next moment, a talisman appeared above Zhang Yu's head.

Divine Protection Talisman!

As the talisman descended, lines of notifications appeared in the eyes of every Soul Transformation Divine Monarch who looked at Zhang Yu.

"Attacking Zhang Yu will result in a fine of 1 million Spirit Coins."

"All Righteous Gods must protect Zhang Yu at any cost for the duration of the Divine Protection Talisman."

"Upon encountering an attack, simultaneously activate 1024 types of talisman reactions..."

"Dedicated network line to the Spirit Realm: Upon death, the soul will be directly transported to the Ministry of All People..."

Looking at the dense lines of text explaining the Divine Protection Talisman, Zhang Yu felt only one thing... he was invincible.

But after checking the talisman's duration, Zhang Yu thought, "This invincibility lasts about a day. Once I choose an Immortal Dao Technique, it will disappear."

"Is this to ensure I can choose an Immortal Sect Technique and guarantee its transmission?"

"But after I make my choice..." Zhang Yu thought to himself, "then there will be no power protecting me."

Meanwhile, the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs present shared the same thought, knowing that an unprecedented competition would unfold among the ten universities over the next day.

Divine Monarch Unrestrained of Heavenly Demon University mused, "Though Kuang Tianqing has fallen, we haven't lost yet. If we can just persuade Zhang Yu to choose the Immortal Sect Technique at the last moment..."

Divine Monarch Heavenly Star of Heavenly Sword University sneered inwardly, "Whether Kuang Tianqing or Zhang Yu wins is irrelevant. What comes next is simply a battle between the universities to control the champion's will."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution of Myriad Laws University thought to himself, "The Four Heavenly Demon Schools' investment in Kuang Tianqing has been wasted, though such investments are trivial to them."

"The true battle begins now. Zhang Yu's victory gives him an initial advantage, but it could provoke a united backlash from the other universities..."

As Zhang Yu and the Divine Monarchs sank into deep contemplation, the Great God of Sentient Creation said calmly, "Then we shall meet again in one day."

As the Great God's projection vanished, ten streams of divine light converged on Zhang Yu.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's voice echoed in Zhang Yu's mind: "Let's go, Zhang Yu. We need to discuss your guaranteed admission to graduate studies and doctoral programs, our full support for your future Soul Transformation breakthrough, and the complete waiver of all cultivation expenses."

At that moment, the Divine Monarch from Immortal Armaments University also transmitted his voice: Zhang Yu, you're not still thinking about studying, are you? Come to Immortal Armaments University, and you can do whatever you want. Did Myriad Laws sign a contract with you? I'll cover the breach of contract fees for you.

Personal contracts can be extremely restrictive, capable of bankrupting individuals.

However, there's a limit to the compensation required for breaching a personal contract. No single contract could force a Foundation Establishment student to pay for an entire Kunxu, and no Righteous God would support such an unreasonable agreement.

Regardless of how astronomical the maximum compensation for breaching a personal contract might be, it would undoubtedly fall within the financial capacity of any of the Ten Great Universities.

When the target is an Immortal Sect Technique, such personal compensation becomes even less of a concern for the principals.

Just as the principals of Myriad Laws and Immortal Armaments Universities finished transmitting their messages, the principal of Celestial Monsters University burst into laughter and declared loudly, "Zhang Yu, if you're willing to choose the Immortal Sect Technique we want, I'll transfer you here. After that, the principal's position will be yours. You'll be the principal."

"Principal Zhang Yu of Celestial Monsters University — what do you think?"

Upon hearing Celestial Monsters University's offer, the other Divine Monarchs present reacted with anger, cold smiles, or stony silence...

Perhaps some naive and foolish individuals might believe the principal genuinely intended to elevate Zhang Yu to the position of principal, but no such fools were present. No one believed the principal of Celestial Monsters University was truly determined or capable of making Zhang Yu its principal.

As Zhang Yu gazed at the divine light representing Celestial Monsters University, he thought to himself, "This old monster is spouting nonsense, making things up as he goes... Does he think I'd never choose Celestial Monsters University, so he's deliberately stirring up trouble?"

At that moment, a crisp female voice echoed from the divine light representing Pill Cauldron University: "Old mudfish, this is an internal matter for the Human Race. It's none of your business to interfere. Zhang Yu is protected by the Great Gods, untouchable by anyone, but you are not."

As more Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs voiced their opinions, the atmosphere grew increasingly tense and oppressive, as if a conflict were about to erupt at any moment.

Amid this volatile atmosphere, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution calmly stated, "Everyone, Zhang Yu has just finished his match and is severely injured. Let's discuss this after he's received proper treatment."

Simultaneously, a Flying Boat arranged by Myriad Laws University landed before Zhang Yu, whisking him away from the scene with a whoosh.

Yet everyone knew this was far from over.

A struggle far more intense, unfathomable, and sinister than the Ten Greats League itself was about to unfold, with Zhang Yu at its center.
