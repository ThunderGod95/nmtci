# Chapter 663: Stealing the Dao Repository

As Zhang Yu's gaze swept across the Immortal Sect Techniques listed in the Dao Repository Catalog, only brief, almost meaningless descriptions appeared.

Before he truly selected an Immortal Sect Technique, Zhang Yu could feel the immense pressure emanating from the Soul Transformation cultivators, pressing down on him from all directions.

However, Zhang Yu understood that while this pressure would intensify and become increasingly oppressive until he made his choice, once he chose an Immortal Sect Technique, the Soul Transformation cultivators would lose the possibility of pursuing higher profits. Instead, they would shift their focus to maintaining the benefits and growth that Zhang Yu's new technology would bring.

"It's just like Teacher Starfire said," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "For a 100-point profit, they'll exert maximum pressure on me. But once they realize they're locked into a 10-point profit and can't recover their sunk costs, they'll stop wasting effort and won't dwell on the past."

"And compared to venting their anger or seeking revenge," Zhang Yu mused, "driven by profit and the fear of falling behind others, they'll still choose to cooperate with me and retain that 10-point profit."

"This is the operating principle of Kunxu's powerhouses — a group of creatures driven purely by profit."

After realizing this, Zhang Yu couldn't help but sigh. He had always disliked certain aspects of Kunxu, but now they had become the very reason he could continue navigating the treacherous space between Soul Transformation, the Ten Universities, and the sects.

By exploiting this principle, Zhang Yu had injected his own will into the world's transformation.

He chose the Immortal Sect Technique "Kunlun in the Palm," thereby interfering with the future of the world.

Just as Zhang Yu completed his selection and gained access to "Kunlun in the Palm," he turned to the host, Dao Qiankun's earlier words echoing in his mind.

"What exactly does 'New World' mean? Was that really Brother Dao speaking? Isn't Brother Dao dead? A feigned death? Why?"

But before Zhang Yu could ponder further, a shocking sight unfolded before him.

As the sky tore open, the Kunxu Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Layers materialized in the sky.

Looking up at the scene that resembled layers of celestial realms, Zhang Yu exclaimed inwardly, "What's happening?"

Unlike Zhang Yu's complete ignorance, many university leaders in the audience had already undergone a drastic change in expression before he even selected the Immortal Sect Technique.

True Monarch Tranquility, observing the streams of information surfacing in his Bionic Eye, grew increasingly grave. "University City riots... Dual Rest Cult invasion... Evil Gods rampaging..."

Director Gao's eyes flickered, his heart sinking. "Myriad Laws... Immortal Soldiers... Vajra... All Ten Great Universities have been attacked. This scale and scope... the Demonic Sect alone couldn't possibly pull this off."

In Zhang Pianpian's Bionic Eye, vast amounts of data surged continuously. "Not just the Second Layer... the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Layers are also under massive assault. The Financial Tsunami has begun... Did the Finance Department participate? So..."

The moment Zhang Pianpian looked up at the sky coincided with the sequential emergence of the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Layer skies.

"The emergency plan has been activated," Zhang Pianpian thought to herself. "Faced with such a massive uprising, the Heavenly Court has chosen to tear open the sky, connecting all layers from the second to the sixth, and intervene directly on a grand scale."

Under countless shocked gazes, the sky above — the zenith of the sixth layer — began to shimmer with dense, golden divine light, as if poised to pierce through the worlds of the second to sixth layers.

True Monarch Tranquility, witnessing this scene, breathed a sigh of relief. "No matter what happens, with the Righteous Gods presiding, these Demonic Sects and Evil Gods won't be able to stir up any real trouble..."

Just as countless powerful figures beneath the sky shared this sentiment, gazing up at the divine light with awe...

In the very next instant, an unfathomable darkness spread across the sixth layer of the sky.

The sky transformed into an abyss, as if the heavens and earth had been inverted, threatening to engulf the entire world.

And the Righteous Gods, who had been shining brightly moments before, flickered like dying lightbulbs as the darkness emerged, their radiance extinguished completely.

Zhang Pianpian, witnessing this, finally showed surprise. "The spatial structure between the 6th and 7th layers... has been temporarily severed? An Immortal must have intervened."

Not only did the divine light above vanish, but soon the people on the 2nd layer discovered that the Righteous Gods had disappeared entirely.

All the Righteous Gods seemed to have been disconnected, vanishing without a trace in an instant.

Immediately, the riots spreading across the schools intensified.

At the same time, many powerful figures at the awards ceremony began to flicker, either retracting their projections or swiftly departing, all eager to reach the attacked areas and salvage their losses.

The Great God of Sentient Creation, who had been standing beside Zhang Yu just moments ago, had also vanished.

The host, who had somehow moved to Zhang Yu's side, said calmly, "My apologies, Zhang Yu. I originally intended to take your place here, but they discovered this body, forcing me to temporarily abandon the Dao Qiankun identity."

"I never imagined you would defeat Kuang Tianqing and make it this far."

As he spoke, Dao Qiankun stepped in front of Zhang Yu, shielding him.

"Kunxu is beyond saving now. Even the forces and ideologies I spread have been twisted by the changing environment."

"Zhang Yu, whether you've chosen the Six Paths of World Evolution Book or are willing to accept the opportunity I offer..."

"From now on... you can hide behind me."

"Until the New World is complete, until this world returns to its proper course."

As he spoke, the host gradually transformed into Dao Qiankun's appearance.

At the same time, the Spirit Realm Network seemed to have come under Dao Qiankun's complete control. Countless cameras focused on him, and all videos and live streams broadcasted his image.

Zhang Pianpian exclaimed inwardly, "Such immense Spirit Realm authority!"

In the next moment, under the gaze of countless viewers, Dao Qiankun declared, "Reincarnation exists."

"Death is not the end, but a new beginning."

"Everyone who dies will be reincarnated."

"Do not fear death."

---

Below the stage.

Ever since the university riots tore a rift in the sky, Kuang Tianqing had been in a state of shock.

"Did we cause this?"

"Could the higher-ups have planned something this massive?"

But when the Righteous Gods vanished, Kuang Tianqing sensed something was amiss.

Ancient memories churned in her mind, possibilities rising and falling in rapid succession, each one dismissed as quickly as it appeared.

"No matter how reckless they are... severing all connections to the Righteous Gods is going too far."

"This can't be the Reincarnation Group's intention."

Watching Dao Qiankun approach Zhang Yu, Kuang Tianqing thought to herself, "He's gone mad. What is he trying to accomplish?"

As Dao Qiankun stood before Zhang Yu and delivered his speech about Reincarnation, a glimmer of understanding gradually dawned in Kuang Tianqing's mind.

"Come to think of it, the Reincarnation Group likely refrained from interfering with Zhang Yu earlier because of 'His' assurances."

"But now, 'His' words will make the Reincarnation Group the target of public ire, leading countless people to suspect that today's entire scheme is connected to promoting the New Reincarnation System..."

Kuang Tianqing, drawing on her memories, realized that the current situation was far from what the Reincarnation Group had intended.

"By exploiting the distribution of Immortal Dao Technology through the Ten Greats League, they gradually manipulated the power dynamics between universities, sects, and Immortals."

"With everyone pursuing their own interests, constantly wary of each other, and their forces fragmented, 'He' executed this earth-shattering scheme."

"He even orchestrated a vast network of alliances, from the highest echelons to the grassroots level, to achieve his goals."

"But what about the consequences? Did 'He' completely disregard them?"

Staring at the pitch-black sky, resembling a bottomless abyss, Kuang Tianqing murmured inwardly, "Why haven't the other Immortals intervened to stop him? Are they preoccupied with other matters?"

Kuang Tianqing thought of the mutually suspecting sects and the Reincarnation Group.

"Most of their forces are likely engaged in confronting the Reincarnation Group."

"But we haven't done anything reckless. Still, other factions likely won't trust us easily now. After all, we've offended too many people and groups promoting the New Reincarnation System, and now we're caught up in this..."

Another suspicion surged in Kuang Tianqing's mind: "But... have we really done nothing reckless?"

Realizing even she harbored doubts, Kuang Tianqing understood the higher-ups would inevitably be wary of the Reincarnation Group.

"But it's futile. At best, it will only buy us a little time..."

As Kuang Tianqing pondered, a sudden light pierced the endless darkness above.

Her heart quickened. "They're here!"

In the dark sky, it was as if two invisible giants were locked in a titanic struggle. The divine light of the Righteous God flickered intermittently, as if on the verge of breaking through the darkness's blockade and descending once more into the mortal realm.

But in the next instant, the entire Second Layer began to tremble violently.

Many soon realized that the tremors weren't confined to the Second Layer. From the Second Layer to the Sixth Layer, every layer of space was convulsing violently.

Kuang Tianqing noticed that the Soul Transformation projections had vanished from the venue. All the Soul Transformation cultivators from the Ten Great Universities had withdrawn their projections.

Meanwhile, deep within the mountains far from the ceremony hall, Nine Heavens Liu, who had skipped the awards ceremony, gazed at the massive construction project before him. He thought to himself, "So this is where the massive funds were being channeled?"

"No, not just here, but into countless hidden corners across floors 2 through 6."

"No wonder they needed to invest such astronomical resources. No wonder they seized control of all Civil Engineering projects. No wonder they took such extraordinary risks..."

Nine Heavens Liu watched as the sixth floor gradually faded into nothingness, an endless surge of ambition rising within him.

"All because this is the profit from an entire New World."

"Without such immense profits, why would the Finance Department ever take such risks?"

"But as long as the profits are sufficient, what do gods matter? What do Immortals matter? What the world dares not do, the Finance Department will!"

"Today, we will seize a world. Today, we will steal Dao Qiankun..."

Nine Heavens Liu knew his Master spoke the truth. The Finance Department had always been exploited, serving as the sect's collective purse. They constantly generated profits, only to have them continually seized. Despite their relentless efforts, the growth of profits and assets had gradually reached its limit. For the countless powerhouses of the Finance Department, this stagnation was unacceptable. Without high growth, confidence would wane, Qi Luck would dissipate, and the very foundation of the department would crumble.

"But if we can seize a world, all our problems will be solved," Nine Heavens Liu thought, gazing at the night sky on the sixth floor. Divine light intertwined and clashed, signaling the start of the Soul Transformation realm battle.

Nine Heavens Liu mused, "Master and the others must be attacking the Soul Transformation realm cultivators' true forms on the sixth floor."

Simultaneously, through his Bionic Eye, Nine Heavens Liu observed prices soaring, stock and currency values plummeting across the Ten Universities, and a Financial Tsunami engulfing floors 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Meanwhile, at the awards ceremony, Zhang Yu watched the gradually disappearing sixth layer in the sky and said gravely, "Brother Dao, I don't know who you truly are, but can I still call you Brother Dao? What exactly are you trying to do?"

Dao Qiankun gazed at the sky and sighed, "Back then, we fought with all our might, sacrificing countless lives, enduring countless bloody battles, to finally establish Kunxu."

"There was no Reincarnation back then. Death was final. My Master, my sect leader... they all perished."

"But we finally defeated those soul-devouring demons, suppressed those man-eating monsters, and crushed every demonic entity that plagued humanity. Yet... yet..."

A trace of sorrow crossed Dao Qiankun's face. "My Dao Companion became a demon among immortals, my fellow disciples became monsters among immortals, and my disciples now ride on the backs of all, flaying and draining them. They have surpassed even the demons and monsters of old in their cruelty."

"They still want to revive the sect leader, to bring back our Master who died beyond the cycle of reincarnation, and they've set their sights on us..."

"How can I face them now? How can I let the sect leader and Master see the world they sacrificed everything for has become this?"

Zhang Yu stared at Dao Qiankun, feeling as if the man before him had transformed into someone else — a solitary youth, his eyes blurred with tears, weeping incessantly.

Dao Qiankun murmured, "As long as those at the top remain, Kunxu will never be on the right path. It will forever be a slaughterhouse, repeatedly slaughtering and exploiting the billions of living beings below, driven mad by their relentless pursuit of profit."

"I will lead the Second to Sixth Layers to break free from Kunxu's shackles and forge a New World."

Turning to face Zhang Yu, Dao Qiankun said, "Zhang Yu, don't be nervous or afraid. Even if you didn't choose the Six Paths of World Evolution Book, even if you didn't seize the opportunity to join me, you can still find shelter behind me."

"You possess the potential I value, but you're bound by the present world and your past experiences, preventing you from making the right choice..."

At that moment, Dao Qiankun's gaze suddenly shifted, turning toward Zhang Pianpian with a hint of surprise. "Oh?"

Zhang Pianpian's message materialized before Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

Zhang Pianpian: Zhang Yu, which cultivation art did you choose?

Zhang Yu: Kunlun in the Palm

Zhang Pianpian: Excellent.

Zhang Pianpian: Don't listen to Dao Qiankun's bewitchment. He can't possibly succeed.

Dao Qiankun watched Zhang Yu, seemingly able to discern the content of their exchange, yet made no attempt to interfere.

As Zhang Pianpian spoke, the gradually fading sixth layer in the sky halted its descent, as if someone had intervened.

Observing this, Dao Qiankun said calmly, "Zhang Yu, it's time for us to leave."

He extended his palm toward Zhang Yu. "Come with me. Staying here will only put you in greater danger."

"Let's go to the New World together."

Zhang Pianpian: Zhang Yu, don't trust him! He's destined to fail. If you go with him, you'll be doomed when the Heavenly Court and the sects come after you.

Hearing Dao Qiankun's words and seeing the characters appear on the Bionic Eye, Zhang Yu took a deep breath and ultimately chose to trust his sister, slowly backing away.

Dao Qiankun sighed as he watched this scene unfold. As the sixth layer of the sky flickered incessantly, the light in his eyes seemed to flicker violently as well, and his entire aura felt unstable.

Dao Qiankun said calmly, "Zhang Yu, if you had chosen any other cultivation art, I would respect your decision and allow you to stay here, to decide your own future."

"But you chose Kunlun in the Palm and inherited my bloodline power. The risk of leaving you here is too great..."

Just as Dao Qiankun was speaking to Zhang Yu, several Nascent Soul and Golden Core Realm experts below surged into the sky, attempting to capture him.

However, beyond the arena, a group of unlicensed powerhouses from the Demonic Sect emerged, overwhelming the sect experts with their numbers and forcing them to engage in fierce combat.

Dao Qiankun paid no attention to the chaotic battle raging outside. Instead, he continued speaking to Zhang Yu, "So I had no choice but to use force to bring you here."

As he spoke, Director Gao, Zhang Pianpian, True Person Starfire, and others launched simultaneous attacks against Dao Qiankun.

But with a sudden spatial distortion, all their attacks were deflected.

This warped space formed a protective barrier, completely enveloping Zhang Yu and Dao Qiankun, preventing any external interference.

In the next instant, Dao Qiankun reached out to grab Zhang Yu. Bolts of lightning crackled through space, surging toward him with overwhelming force.

In that moment, Zhang Yu felt Dao Qiankun's palm fill the heavens and earth, as if it would completely engulf him in a single grasp.

"Space is shifting..." Zhang Yu thought in alarm. "Is this an Immortal Sect Technique involving Spatial Technology?"

Zhang Yu knew that regardless of who this "Dao Qiankun" truly was, his power was immense. Even with the Righteous Gods absent, he could brazenly wield Immortal Sect Techniques, defying all rules.

At the same moment, Zhang Pianpian's message appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye:

Zhang Pianpian: Don't be afraid of him. He's currently focused on leading the battle on the sixth layer and can't spare any power or attention to what's happening below.

Zhang Pianpian: All he can use is Dao Qiankun's physical body. His data and abilities are still limited to Dao Qiankun's original capabilities.

Zhang Pianpian: His essence remains Dao Qiankun; he's merely gained some additional memories.

Simultaneously, Zhang Pianpian shouted to Director Gao, True Person Starfire, and the others nearby, "Keep attacking! His Magic Power is deflecting our attacks across space, but he won't be able to sustain it for long."

Watching the Spatial Distortion gradually crack, the group's spirits lifted, knowing they would soon break through Dao Qiankun's defenses.

At that very moment, Zhang Pianpian activated her livestream, intending to record everything that was about to unfold below.

"We need to solidify the fact that Zhang Yu is fighting alongside us against Dao Qiankun..."

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu sensed Dao Qiankun's approaching palm, he poured all his mental energy into achieving an unprecedented state of mental focus.

Contracting, expanding, shrinking, enlarging...

These were the meanings behind the only three techniques of Kunlun in the Palm.

Facing Dao Qiankun's attack, Zhang Yu wholeheartedly immersed himself in the mysteries of Kunlun in the Palm, striving to cast aside all distractions.

The first technique tore through space, Dao Qiankun's palm striking Zhang Yu directly out of his Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor.

The second technique, Heavenly Sun Radiance God, along with the twenty-four Sacred Law Flying Swords, were all sucked into Dao Qiankun's palm by a twisting spatial distortion.

The third technique summoned bolts of lightning that spanned space, locking Zhang Yu's body in place. Simultaneously, he felt himself shrinking, drawn inexorably toward Dao Qiankun's palm.

But after these three techniques, a flicker of surprise appeared in Dao Qiankun's eyes.

A visible distortion rippled from Zhang Yu's body.

The air itself seemed to dance around him, sunlight bending around his form.

Kunlun in the Palm Level 1 (0/10)

As Level 1 Kunlun in the Palm activated, Zhang Yu surged forward, breaking free from the spatial distortion's grip and leaping out of Dao Qiankun's grasp.

The onlookers stared in astonishment at the scene unfolding before them.

"He learned it?!" Director Gao exclaimed, his voice trembling. "He just got Kunlun in the Palm! How could Zhang Yu have mastered it so quickly?"

True Person Starfire, standing nearby, was equally shaken. "This is an Immortal Sect Technique! How could he learn it after just one use?"

Dao Qiankun, his expression shifting, nodded at Zhang Yu. "So that's how it is," he murmured.

His face hardened. "Then you have even more reason to come with me."

Dao Qiankun's aura surged violently. No longer needing to conceal his power or rely on the Golden Core Certificate, he directly ascended to the Golden Core Realm.

His next strike was exponentially more powerful. Zhang Yu felt the space before him solidify into an impenetrable iron wall, utterly unshakable even by his Level 1 Kunlun in the Palm.

"Is he about to break through?"

"But breaking through now would mean ascending to the Golden Core Realm without the certificate."

"Yet if he doesn't break through, that man will capture him."

As Zhang Yu frantically analyzed the situation, Dao Qiankun's offensive suddenly slackened.

The Spatial Distortion that had enveloped the area shattered, and the combined assault from Director Gao, True Person Starfire, Zhang Pianpian, and the others crashed down.

Yet Dao Qiankun didn't even glance at them. Instead, he turned with surprise toward Yu Xinghan.

"My martial arts? This brat actually managed to learn a fraction of it just now?"

"But that fraction... it disrupted my calculations and forced Gao Chongguang and the others to launch their attack prematurely."

"Very well..."

Dao Qiankun's figure flickered, gradually phasing out of reality like the ethereal sixth layer itself. All attacks aimed at him struck only empty air.

With a surge of power, Dao Qiankun shot skyward, drawn upward by an unseen force toward the Kunxu Sixth Layer hanging in the sky.

Simultaneously, the Sixth Layer's etherealization accelerated.

In Dao Qiankun's eyes, an infinitely vast world seemed to unfold before him.

He spread his arms wide, embracing this New World.
