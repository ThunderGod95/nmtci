# Chapter 642: The Dharma Realm and the Immortal Dao Revolution

Zhang Yu declared, "If I took money to smear Extreme Tiger, I'd be struck down by a Soul Transformation cultivator the moment I stepped outside!"

"I'm now collecting evidence across the entire network. Anyone who can prove I took money to smear Extreme Tiger will receive 1,000 Spirit Coins."

He then glared at Tian Shengong and challenged, "Do you dare? Do you dare sign a contract with me? Whoever takes money to smear a brand pays the other 1,000 Spirit Coins."

Tian Shengong scoffed, "Enough with the empty talk. In the next round, I'll use Extreme Tiger magical artifacts, Extreme Tiger Bionics — the purest, most complete Extreme Tiger power — to utterly crush you!"

"If I defeat you, you must use Extreme Tiger Bionics from now on. Do you dare to bet?"

Zhang Yu grinned. "Fine by me. But if I win, you'll never be allowed to use any Extreme Tiger products again. Do you dare to bet?"

As Tian Shengong and Zhang Yu argued, the livestream's popularity surged, and both received a barrage of Spirit Coin donations.

With the stakes set, the livestream's viewership reached an unprecedented peak.

After the broadcast ended, Tian Shengong smiled contentedly at his earnings, marveling that his cultivation efforts had not been in vain.

"If I could maintain this level of hype by arguing with Zhang Yu every few days, it would actually be a decent cultivation method."

Unfortunately, Tian Shengong knew this was impossible. "In our next battle, I'll completely shut down his slander against Extreme Tiger."

Defeating Zhang Yu wasn't just Tian Shengong's personal ambition; it was also a demand from the Extreme Tiger Group and had the full support of Immortal Armaments University.

Tian Shengong rubbed his temples, thinking to himself, "The Four Heavenly Demon Schools are trying to monopolize the lifespan market through life extension."

He understood that for Immortal Armaments University and the Extreme Tiger Group, life extension itself wasn't the problem — it was that the technology shouldn't be controlled by the Four Heavenly Demon Schools.

If life extension technology fell into the hands of other schools, both Immortal Armaments University and the Extreme Tiger Group would be suppressed for centuries, perhaps even millennia.

To Kunxu as a whole, this might be a mere footnote in history, but to Tian Shengong, it could mean his entire life.

"The Four Heavenly Demon Schools will monetize lifespans, exploiting other universities and companies. I absolutely cannot allow this."

"Kuang Tianqing... I won't let her claim the top spot."

"And Zhang Yu... not to mention his slander against Extreme Tiger and the damage to our brand, I won't tolerate his actions."

"If Zhang Yu were to claim first place and Myriad Laws University were to obtain the Immortal Dao Technology from the Immortal Sect Technique, the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm, and begin constructing the Dharma Realm, it would be even more insane than the Four Heavenly Demon Schools."

Tian Shengong rubbed his temples, and a memory resurfaced in his mind.

It was a battle he had fought within the Dharma Realm, where the funds in his account had directly transformed into various martial arts, daoist arts, and magical artifacts that materialized around him.

The memory of the Dharma Realm filled Tian Shengong with dread. "In the Dharma Realm, if I had only 5,000 Blood and someone dealt 10,000 damage to me, I would still owe 5,000 Blood. I would be constantly repaying this debt, perhaps for my entire next life, and the life after that."

"A wealthy person could defeat a poor person with a single strike, sending them from their previous life to the next, from a sect to a university, or even down to the first stratum."

"Once the Dharma Realm is established, the world will become this terrifying."

"Under the Dharma Realm's influence, everything imaginable — magical artifacts, Bionics, cultivation art tiers, lifespan, even Immortal Dao Realm cultivation levels — could be directly purchased."

"Compared to the Four Heavenly Demon Schools' monetization of lifespan, the Dharma Realm's financialization of all things is far more insane."

"In that world, personal choices, work, everything would become meaningless in the face of wealth accumulation."

"Forces like Immortal Armaments University and Extreme Tiger Group, which focus on diligent production and honest manufacturing, will be the first to be harvested."

If Tian Shengong found the choices of the Four Heavenly Demon Schools unacceptable, he found the choice of Myriad Laws University even more intolerable.

"Only the philosophies of Immortal Armaments University and Extreme Tiger Group are correct."

"To make high-performance Bionics affordable for everyone, allowing each individual to reach their full potential, and to make the world more efficient — maximizing the use of resources and talents."

"We must stop the Four Heavenly Demon Schools, and even more so, Myriad Laws..."

Suddenly, Tian Shengong remembered Dao Qiankun, recalling their conversation before the Ten Greats League began.

At that time, he had asked Dao Qiankun about his plans and which Immortal Sect Technique he would choose.

Now, reflecting on that conversation, Tian Shengong felt a pang of regret. "Dao Qiankun, you refused to choose the Dharma Realm until the very end, and that's why Myriad Laws University abandoned you?"

"Whether for my own Immortal Dao future or for the sake of this world, in the next battle... I must completely defeat Zhang Yu."

"Has the Reincarnation Group made their move?"

In the quiet chamber, Kuang Tianqing rubbed her temples, replaying the battle against Wen Wuya in her mind.

During that fight, Wen Wuya had displayed strength far surpassing his previous performance.

Many of his habits, tactics, and sword techniques... were completely unfamiliar, never seen before.

"It was like he suddenly became a different person."

"Perhaps it's because..."

As she massaged her temples, Kuang Tianqing's gaze sharpened, and a memory surfaced in her mind.

It was from an institution called the Six Paths of Reincarnation, where after death, she had been judged based on moral standards and her contributions to Kunxu, determining her reincarnation.

Watching those scenes unfold in her memory, Kuang Tianqing sneered inwardly. "Backward."

"Utterly backward."

"Morality? Who gets to judge? Contributions? How can they be quantified?"

"If it were up to me, I'd make it a clear-cut auction: whoever has the most money gets the best reincarnation."

As she processed these memories, Kuang Tianqing thought, "So, the Reincarnation Group is behind this, trying to influence me by reviving my past life's memories?"

"It seems Wen Wuya's situation in the last battle was similar, except his restored memories were more advantageous, ultimately strengthening him."

"Will Bai Zhenzhen face the same situation in the next battle?"

"The Reincarnation Group truly employs terrifying methods."

Though Kuang Tianqing sensed the Reincarnation Group's unfathomable depths, her resolve remained unshaken.

She had long since boarded the ship with no way back and no retreat.

"I must become the spokesperson for longevity technology. This isn't just for my own Immortal Dao path, but also to stabilize the world's situation."

"Myriad Laws seeks to establish the Dharma Realm, while Immortal Soldiers aim to achieve the Immortal Dao Revolution..."

Thinking of Immortal Armaments University and companies like Extreme Tiger Group striving for the Immortal Dao Revolution, Kuang Tianqing couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

"This so-called Immortal Dao Revolution aims to connect everyone's Bionics and magical artifacts, ultimately centralizing all resources — Magic Power, Gang Qi, Computational Power, innate talents, physical bodies, and everything else — under unified control. The goal is to eliminate all idle capacity within society, pushing the world's efficiency to its absolute limit, claiming to 'utilize every resource to its fullest and harness each person's potential to its peak.'"

"And the Soul Transformation candidates from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools are each more ambitious than the last."

"These fanatics will stop at nothing to climb to the top, growing increasingly radical and desperate."

As Kuang Tianqing contemplated the immense profits hidden behind these radical goals, she felt an overwhelming pressure.

"Dao Qiankun..." she murmured inwardly, "Did you succumb to this pressure and ultimately choose to flee?"

Her mind conjured up the newly acquired intelligence — evidence of Dao Qiankun's communication with the Ascension Sect. This evidence had led to the conclusion that Dao Qiankun had been bewitched by the sect and committed suicide.

But to Kuang Tianqing, the matter was far more complex than mere suicide.

"If death were a market, then longevity, Soul Cultivation, and Reincarnation would be its three major players."

"And for the Reincarnation Group, which cannot advertise openly..."

In Kuang Tianqing's eyes, the Ascension Sect served as the Reincarnation Group's sales team.

Dao Qiankun's death, as she now saw it...

"You fled."

"Dao Qiankun, you couldn't bear the weight, so you escaped through the Ascension Sect?"

"But I will not flee."

"I will ensure that the aging Soul Transformation experts of the Four Heavenly Demon Schools master longevity technology, stabilizing the world."

"And I will seize this opportunity to ascend to the pinnacle of the Immortal Dao."

"Whether it's Bai Zhenzhen in the next round, or Zhang Yu and Tian Shengong, I will crush them all completely."

On Bai Zhenzhen's Flying Boat, she sat cross-legged, gently stroking the Yuhuan Sword in her hand.

Suddenly, she spoke, "Master, did you say... you want me to use this battle to temper myself?"

The Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' voice echoed in Bai Zhenzhen's ear: "Kuang Tianqing, your next opponent, is the perfect candidate to hone your Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"Her strength, her experiences, and the entanglement between you two — all serve as the finest whetstone for your sword."

Bai Zhenzhen asked, "Master, do you think I have a chance of defeating her?"

The Divine Monarch Seven Emotions replied coolly, "I merely want you to seize this opportunity to temper yourself. I'm not asking you to defeat her."

"In truth, whether it's you, Tian Shengong, or Zhang Yu, your chances of defeating Kuang Tianqing are zero."

"But you should be grateful you won't claim first place."

Bai Zhenzhen asked, puzzled, "Why?"

The Divine Monarch Seven Emotions snorted coldly. "Though some are still making attempts, playing a few idle moves, it's clear that most Soul Transformation cultivators are already preparing under the assumption that Kuang Tianqing will secure first place."

"For Kuang Tianqing, only after claiming first place will she face her true trial."

"The pressure she'll face then will likely be a hundred or a thousand times greater than what she's facing in these battles."

"And if she falters even slightly during that time, she'll be utterly destroyed, her soul scattered and spirit extinguished."

Bai Zhenzhen asked, "Then... if Zhang Yu were to take first place, would he face the same pressure?"
