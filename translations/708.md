# Chapter 708: The Changes Brought by Zhang Yu, Heavenly Court Countdown

On the conference stage, Zhang Yu gazed at the university leaders and elites in the audience, as well as the projections representing Soul Transformation and Nascent Soul cultivators. He knew that countless eyes from the Ten Great Universities were fixed on him at this moment, and that the Evil Gods, Demonic Sects, and traitors of the Righteous Qi Alliance were watching him as well.

In this moment, he had become the focal point of Kunxu's Second to Fifth Layers, poised to unleash a world-shaking tide.

Zhang Yu understood that this conference would be etched in history, and as its host, his name would be mentioned countless times in the future, his words replayed and scrutinized by countless people.

The realization made him feel a surge of nervous anticipation.

"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a day I have long awaited."

"Previously, Myriad Laws developed the Great Void Cloud Repository, introducing the concept of the Personal Space Platform. This brought Spatial Technology into the daily lives of cultivators, completely transforming their routines and inspiring countless competitors to study and emulate it."

"Today, I am honored to stand before you to unveil three revolutionary new products."

"They will utterly disrupt the existing logistics industry and usher in an entirely new industrial ecosystem..."

Wang Yin watched Zhang Yu speak eloquently on stage, introducing the features of the Great Void Cloud Repository Second Generation, his eyes filled with shock.

He was not only stunned by the revolutionary breakthroughs of the Great Void Cloud Repository Second Generation but also by Zhang Yu's role as the host of this launch event.

"Spatial Layering, Anti-Gravity, and Spatial Lockdown... The new Great Void Cloud Repository surpasses all other space pouch products currently on the market."

"This is a groundbreaking product, poised to usher in the Space Pouch 2.0 era — a monumental achievement destined to be recorded in history. However..."

Wang Yin stared at Zhang Yu on the stage, his thoughts surging like a tidal wave. "Why? Why would they let Zhang Yu announce such an important product? Shouldn't Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole be doing this?"

"Has he become so important in Myriad Laws, in Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's eyes?"

"Are they already grooming Zhang Yu as their true successor?"

"Why? Wasn't he just a leech, milking research funding?"

Wang Yin suddenly recalled his first encounter with Zhang Yu.

Back then, Wang Yin was the son of True Monarch Nether Spring. After losing to Zhang Yu, he had redoubled his efforts, finally becoming the son of Divine Monarch Nether Spring years later — a meteoric rise from the son of a Nascent Soul cultivator to the son of a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch.

Yet compared to Zhang Yu's achievements, his progress seemed utterly insignificant.

Zhang Yu had climbed from a penniless nobody in the First Layer to become a Second-Generation School Elite at Myriad Laws University, the designated successor of Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, and was already overseeing the affairs of the Spatial Technology Research Association.

Meanwhile, Wang Yin remained a mere assistant, running errands in the Space Laboratory at Netherworld University.

"Not only has he surpassed me in cultivation realm, but he's completely outstripped me in status and even my ability to mooch off my family..."

As Wang Yin was deep in thought, Divine Monarch Nether Spring sent him a message.

Divine Monarch Nether Spring: Send me Zhang Yu's contact. I want to add him as a friend.

Wang Yin whipped his head around, staring at Divine Monarch Nether Spring. "Mom, you want to add Zhang Yu as a friend? You're a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch! He's just a Nascent Soul cultivator. What merit does he possess... that would make you proactively contact him? I can handle contacting him for you..."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring watched Zhang Yu on the stage with keen interest. "This boy's status has risen beyond recognition. If you stood before him now, your position would likely be lower than his. He might not even acknowledge you."

"The Great Void Cloud Repository Second Generation represents a revolutionary breakthrough, one that will significantly impact the future landscape of the Ten Universities. I need to discuss many things with him in depth."

At this point, Divine Monarch Nether Spring sighed. "The Great Void Cloud Repository's breakthrough is too significant. We'll likely have to expand our collaboration with Myriad Laws in the future."

"Communicating with this boy will be much easier than dealing with Magnetic Pole, right?"

Divine Monarch Nether Spring then turned to Wang Yin beside her, explaining, "Besides... silly child, what does a lower cultivation realm matter? As long as it's related to making money, I'd proactively add even a Qi Refining cultivator. If you lack that kind of vision, what's the point of cultivating the Immortal Dao?"

With that, Divine Monarch Nether Spring urged, "Hurry up and send it."

Watching his once aloof mother now being added to Zhang Yu's friend list by his own hand, Wang Yin felt a wave of helplessness.

As he sent the request, a sudden wave of worry washed over him. He recalled True Person Starfire from the First Layer, Zhang Yu's support from Divine Monarch Greenwood during his time in the Civil Engineering Department at Myriad Laws University, and now Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole...

Wang Yin couldn't help but warn, "Mom, be careful when interacting with Zhang Yu. Don't let him take advantage of you. That guy... seems particularly adept at mooching off others."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring laughed. "Nonsense! Who do you think I am? Do you think some greenhorn could possibly take advantage of me?"

Meanwhile, on the stage, Zhang Yu had begun explaining the logistics and sharing systems of the Great Void Cloud Repository Second Generation.

Zhang Yu: "To make the Great Void Cloud Repository accessible to everyone, and to truly bring spatial technology into every household, we've decided to officially launch the Shared Great Void alongside the personal edition!"

Kunxu's Third Layer.

Inside the Research Association.

Yan Qianji, Bei Wufeng, Jin Jun, Zi Yunzhen, Su Yunni, and others gathered to watch the live broadcast of the press conference.

Yan Qianji glanced around and asked, "Isn't Zhang Yu planning to watch with us?"

Jin Jun replied, "The True Monarch has his own arrangements. He might be watching directly from the venue."

Yan Qianji shot him a disdainful look, harboring no fondness for this sycophant who only revolved around Zhang Yu.

"Meanwhile," he thought to himself, "Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole has already developed the next-generation Great Void Cloud Repository. Yet Zhang Yu pays no attention to space research, barely visiting the laboratory a few times a month."

"What a waste of talent... If I had his resources, I'd have already delved deep into Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's research and perhaps even participated in the development of the new Great Void Cloud Repository."

As Zhang Yu's figure appeared on the broadcast, confidently explaining the new features of the Great Void Cloud Repository, Yan Qianji's eyes filled with bewilderment.

"Why is this happening? Zhang Yu spends all his time freeloading off research funds and focusing solely on his own cultivation. He hasn't contributed a single thing to the research on Spatial Technology. Why would they choose him to host the press conference?"

Yan Qianji couldn't help but sigh inwardly. Ever since Myriad Laws changed principals, the world had grown so dark. Dedicated researchers like him were relegated to contract work, while someone like Zhang Yu, who misappropriated research funds for his own cultivation, was being vigorously promoted.

The thought filled Yan Qianji with immense frustration and resentment.

Jin Jun, standing beside him, burst into laughter. "As expected of a True Monarch! Hosting this press conference proves how deeply the principal trusts you."

Yan Qianji snorted coldly, his voice dripping with bitterness. "He hasn't spent nearly enough time studying Spatial Technology. How can he possibly explain it clearly? What if he makes a mistake?"

Seeing the two were about to argue again, Bei Wufeng quickly interjected, "The principal chose True Monarch Blazing Light to host the press conference because he believes True Monarch Blazing Light is capable. Perhaps True Monarch Blazing Light has gained a profound understanding of the Great Void Cloud Repository's technology in ways we haven't witnessed."

Immortal Armaments University.

Tian Shengong and a group of others were waiting for the Myriad Laws University press conference to begin, preparing to watch the live broadcast together.

A student nearby looked at Tian Shengong with envy and admiration, saying, "Senior, you're so young, not even thirty yet, and you've already entered the university's Space Laboratory to study under Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets. Your future prospects are limitless!"

Another student chimed in, "That's right, Senior Tian Shengong. With your talent, you're destined to have a prominent place in the field of Spatial Technology."

A third student added, "Our university's Void Box is already the top-selling brand in the space pouch market. Senior Tian Shengong, you'll undoubtedly become a leading figure in this industry..."

Tian Shengong smiled modestly, appearing neither arrogant nor complacent, but inwardly he felt quite pleased with himself.

Although his work in the laboratory had been arduous these past few days, he believed he had made significant progress. He even had a feeling...

"Among the younger generation under thirty, I'm likely the most advanced cultivator in the field of Space."

Just then, as Myriad Laws University's press conference officially began, Tian Shengong saw Zhang Yu appear on stage.

"Zhang Yu is hosting the press conference?!"

"What gave him the right to do that?"

Tian Shengong was momentarily stunned. His first thought was, "Could the new generation Great Void Cloud Repository have failed? Are Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and the others lacking confidence and afraid of losing face, so they're throwing Zhang Yu out to speak?"

But as Zhang Yu began to unveil the features one by one — spatial layering, spatial lockdown, anti-gravity, and more — Tian Shengong realized the new generation Great Void Cloud Repository hadn't failed at all. Instead, it was far more powerful than any other space pouch product on the market.

The anti-gravity function, in particular, posed a massive threat to Immortal Armaments University's Void Box.

Tian Shengong thought to himself, "The Void Box's small capacity was originally designed to appeal to lower-level cultivators. Now that Myriad Laws has cracked anti-gravity, weight is no longer a limitation for space pouches... What competitive edge does the Void Box have against the Great Void Cloud Repository now?"

He knew that if the Void Box couldn't be upgraded with anti-gravity capabilities, it would soon become obsolete.

"But even with anti-gravity... can it truly compete with the Great Void Cloud Repository?"

Soon, Tian Shengong saw Zhang Yu on the livestream discussing the Shared Great Void.

As he heard that the Shared Great Void would be deployed throughout the city, making it accessible to all Qi Refinement Students, Tian Shengong's face paled.

The mid-to-low-end market was precisely the Immortal Armaments University's primary target. To Tian Shengong, the Shared Great Void was like draining the well dry, poised to drive the university's Void Boxes into a complete rout.

And to host the launch event for such a crucial product...

Watching Zhang Yu on the livestream, Tian Shengong realized that the man's status within Myriad Laws had far surpassed his wildest expectations.

He recalled their first showdown at the Ten Greats League, when Zhang Yu had only narrowly defeated him. Tian Shengong could never have imagined that in just one or two years, the gap between them would widen so dramatically.

In another corner of the Research Association, in the Meditation Chamber Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen often used for cultivation, Bai Zhenzhen sat alone, watching the live broadcast.

Beside her, the Qingtian Sword Spirit observed Bai Zhenzhen's beaming smile and couldn't help but remark, "Is this the man you're using to cultivate the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao?"

"Your taste in men is terrible."

Bai Zhenzhen raised an eyebrow. "Huh?"

The Sword Spirit continued, "Zhang Yu's future is too bright, his fame too great, and his wealth too vast. A cultivator like him will face endless temptations, especially from those Joyful Union Demonesses, who will likely try to drain his cultivation and his fortune. These things... could easily cause your Extreme Emotion Sword Dao to go astray."

"We practitioners of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao should choose ordinary, easily manipulated cultivators as our cultivation partners..."

Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but retort, "Ancestor, times have changed. The new generation of cultivators doesn't care about such things. All cultivation is just Immortal Dao Technology for self-improvement."

"Besides, Zhang Yu isn't just my cultivation partner; he's also my dear brother, my good son, and my loving father. If he hadn't worked tirelessly at part-time jobs to support me back then, I might still be stuck on the First Layer."

Bai Zhenzhen sighed. "I, Bai Zhenzhen, am not one to forget my roots. I would never hinder my good brother's progress for the sake of my own cultivation."

"In fact, if my good brother ever needs help with anything, I wouldn't hesitate to lend him a hand."

Hearing Bai Zhenzhen's words, the Sword Spirit paused, then let out a long sigh and vanished into thin air.

"What a tragedy! How could the new generation heir of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao have become like this?"

Bai Zhenzhen glanced in the direction the Sword Spirit had disappeared and consoled her. "Ancestor, everyone is evolving. You can't stay stuck in the past either."

Sword Spirit: "Get lost!"

Bai Zhenzhen shook her head and turned her attention back to the live-streamed press conference.

Near the Grand Void, Yu Xinghan and his colleagues were watching the live broadcast of Myriad Laws University's press conference.

This was considered a company team-building activity, and with Zhang Yu's approval, the time spent watching the broadcast counted as overtime, for which they would be paid extra.

As a result, the employees watching the press conference were all beaming with joy, their faces radiating an unprecedented sense of ease.

After all, getting paid overtime without having to work was something they had never even dared to dream of.

When the employees told others about this arrangement, no one believed them, suspecting it was some kind of scam.

Watching all this, Yu Xinghan thought to himself, "What is Zhang Yu thinking? This overtime pay is going to cost a fortune!"

Yu Xinghan wasn't the only one with such concerns. Lady Fortune, Ying Xin, and others had also voiced their opposition to this practice.

Lady Fortune, in particular, felt deeply distressed by the idea of paying overtime wages for not working.

"Paying overtime without reason is a disastrous policy that will ruin the nation and harm the people!" she declared. "If this continues, the university will cease to be a university, and the nation will cease to be a nation!"

Lady Fortune's earnest admonition failed to dissuade Zhang Yu from his autocratic ways.

As Yu Xinghan pondered this, he glanced at the appearances of the employees around him.

Unlike many other construction companies and construction teams, Yu Xinghan noticed that, over time, their company's employees seemed to have become noticeably slimmer, with more classical features.

At first, he found this odd. After some investigation, Yu Xinghan realized that people with such physiques and appearances were simply more likely to be hired by their company.

"Is this... because of Zhang Yu's aesthetic preferences?" Yu Xinghan wondered inwardly. "More and more people are conforming to Zhang Yu's tastes."

"Because they've gradually realized that those who align with his aesthetic are more likely to gain access to Zhang Yu, secure opportunities, and receive promotions..."

Watching several men and women pass by, all bearing a resemblance to himself, Bai Zhenzhen, and Le Mulan, Yu Xinghan shook his head. "As Zhang Yu's status rises, his influence truly grows stronger."

Yu Xinghan knew this influence extended beyond mere appearances.

For instance, the Songyang Gang within the company was composed entirely of natives from Songyang City on the First Layer.

Sensing that fellow Songyang natives were more likely to be hired and promoted by Zhang Yu, more and more Songyang residents joined the company. They unconsciously began to emulate Zhang Yu's habit of favoring his hometown peers, fostering an extraordinary sense of unity.

Having learned that Zhang Yu valued old friendships, cared for his own people, and embodied the virtues of ancient heroes, Yu Xinghan once overheard members of the Songyang Gang using archaic phrases like "loyalty above all" and "ready to take a blade for a friend."

Watching Zhang Yu shine brightly at the press conference, Yu Xinghan could almost see his influence about to surge anew, exerting an ever-growing impact on the entire company, the school, and even external institutions.

At that moment, as Zhang Yu announced the Shared Cloud Repository plan, the assembled employees erupted in cheers.

Across the room, Ying Xin, Shi Huaiyu, Xiao Qingxuan, Shi Yunxiang, and others watched with gleaming eyes.

Ying Xin: "Shared Cloud Repository? Will this become as ubiquitous as the Bionic Eye, a spatial equipment everyone uses?"

Shi Huaiyu nodded vigorously, her mind made up. "I'm going to apply for graduate studies in the Artifact Refinement Department."

Shi Yunxiang watched Zhang Yu on the conference stage, thinking to himself, "Even if the Civil Engineering Department is more lucrative now, in the long run, it can't compare to the Artifact Refinement Department."

A shared thought surged through their minds: leaving the Civil Engineering Department and construction companies was the only way to follow Zhang Yu into new frontiers.

This decision stemmed from rational analysis, but also from an instinctive sense of trust. They felt closer to Zhang Yu, better positioned to follow him, and believed this path would lead to greater prospects on their Immortal Dao journey.

Nearby, Yu Xinghan sensed the thoughts of many Myriad Laws Civil Engineering practitioners. It wasn't just Ying Xin, Shi Yunxiang, Shi Huaiyu, Xiao Qingxuan, and others from their company; many other students in the Civil Engineering Department felt the same way.

Yu Xinghan sighed, "They all see Zhang Yu as the ultimate role model, trying to emulate his path from Civil Engineering to artifact refinement."

At the press conference, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus sighed, "Shared Great Void and Myriad Laws are completely revolutionizing the existing logistics system."

"With this, countless logistics companies will likely go bankrupt. Most people will only need to use Shared Great Void for their daily logistics needs."

"A revolutionary breakthrough has created an entirely new ecosystem."

If it were just this, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus would still be determined to catch up. He absolutely refused to surrender such a massive market.

But when Zhang Yu announced Myriad Laws' partnerships with Vajra University and Heavenly Sword University, and expressed his hopes for future collaborations with other universities, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus knew the path to catching up would be even more arduous.

"Heh... After all, not everyone is like me, wanting to fight for a piece of the pie."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus could already imagine that as Myriad Laws extended an olive branch, willingly ceding some profits and even exchanging technology for market share...

"Soon, many universities will likely form joint ventures with Myriad Laws, sharing in the benefits of the Shared Great Void."

"Even at Heavenly Demon University, there are likely far more people who want to collaborate directly with Myriad Laws to make money than those who support my proposal to 'invest more and compete to the end.'"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus understood perfectly that continuing to pour resources into Heavenly Demon University's independent development would not only yield no short-term profits but also carry significant risks. Many cultivators, even Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, would believe that partnering with Myriad Laws for steady profits was the better option.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus didn't expect to dissuade the other Divine Monarchs from collaborating, but at least...

"Even while collaborating, we must continue to promote independent research and development. Even if funding is reduced... we must at least preserve a Fire Seed, a qualification to compete with Myriad Laws."

"Wouldn't this also strengthen our position in future negotiations with Myriad Laws?"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus believed this angle would secure the support of all the Divine Monarchs.

Meanwhile, at Immortal Armaments University, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets grew increasingly alarmed as he reviewed the updates. "How could they release so many new features at once? We can't copy them all... it's impossible to keep up!"

He was particularly shaken by the ecosystem the Shared Great Void planned to create.

"No, we must collaborate with Myriad Laws. We need to decipher their technology through collaboration."

"We need to lure them to establish factories and companies at Immortal Armaments University..."

In the audience at the same press conference, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood sat together, their expressions serene and unruffled.

Divine Monarch Greenwood gazed at Zhang Yu on the stage and remarked, "He must be our most outstanding disciple, wouldn't you agree?"

"Time truly flies," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole nodded. "It feels like just yesterday when he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and now he's already reached the Nascent Soul stage."

"Zhang Yu will undoubtedly become a pillar of Myriad Laws in the future," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole continued. "Having him host this conference is part of our preparations for that..."

Divine Monarch Greenwood's gaze sharpened. "Are you referring to the future announcement of his achievements in Spatial Technology?"

"Of course," Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole replied matter-of-factly. "For now, we're shielding him with my reputation. But sooner or later, he must bear the full weight of this honor and responsibility himself. This is merely an early opportunity for him to experience it firsthand."

Divine Monarch Greenwood nodded slowly, his eyes filled with pride as he watched Zhang Yu on the stage.

But as he glanced at the information displayed on his Bionic Eye, his expression quickly soured.

"Sigh, more and more students from the Civil Engineering Department are applying to the Artifact Refinement Department's Master's program."

At that moment, Divine Monarch Greenwood couldn't decide whether to be angry about the increasing number of students abandoning his department or pleased by the growing ambition of Civil Engineering students.

As the press conference unfolded, news of the next-generation Great Void Cloud Repository and the Shared Great Void had already set the Spirit Realm ablaze.

Every corner of the Spirit Realm buzzed with discussions about these groundbreaking developments.

The Dark Spirit Realm was no exception.

Meanwhile, key figures of the Righteous Qi Alliance — the Auspicious God, Joy God, Herald God, Divine Monarch Chain Nexus, Divine Monarch Treasure Flow, and others — were all watching the live broadcast.

The Joy God remarked coldly, "The Spatial Lockdown technology used here must be based on the Immortal Dao techniques from the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier. How has the Magnetic Pole mastered it to this extent?"

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus replied, "It's not just mastery. To be honest... Magnetic Pole's application in magical artifact refinement may already surpass all of us present. Perhaps only the Alliance Leader can truly surpass her."

At this, the entire room fell silent. Whether Evil Gods or Soul Transformation experts, all wore solemn expressions.

After a long silence, the Herald God's voice finally reached the assembled deities: "Given your expertise, what impact will the application of this new generation of Great Void Cloud Repository technology have on the military domain, specifically on the current Third Layer Battlefield?"

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus replied, "Mass-deployable spatial barriers capable of filtering matter and moving at high speeds."

"To be frank, this will completely revolutionize battlefield tactics, posing a severe technological threat. We're talking about a generational gap here."

The Herald God pressed, "How severe?"

"It will shatter our existing defensive systems and reshape the very rhythm of warfare..."

Growing impatient, the Herald God demanded, "Stop beating around the bush and be more specific."

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus said, "If we fail to develop countermeasures using equivalent technology..."

"Then, once the Ten Universities complete their large-scale rearmament, combat below the Soul Transformation realm... they'll crush us like stepping on insects."

The Herald God sighed. "It has been a year and a half since the Great Upheaval."

"For a full eighteen months, we have failed to unify the Second to Fifth Layers."

"According to the Heavenly Court's predictions, they will return in approximately six months."

"But considering the worst-case scenario, the Heavenly Court might return even sooner."

"There is no need to wait any longer."

"I have emerged from seclusion."

A hazy figure materialized before the assembled forces of the Dark Spirit Realm.

Upon seeing the figure's appearance, the cultivators and Evil Gods present exclaimed in unison, "Alliance Leader!"

This Immortal disciple, the Righteous Qi Alliance's strongest member and the supreme master of the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier, projected his presence before them, instantly filling them with boundless confidence and dispelling the lingering gloom.

Fu Xiantian, the man known as the Alliance Leader, gazed at Zhang Yu through the live broadcast feed and declared, "The Herald God speaks truly. The Fifth Layer must be destroyed."

"But beyond that, one more thing must be done."

"Within one month, I will annihilate all Soul Transformation experts from the Ten Great Universities."
