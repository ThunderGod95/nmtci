# Chapter 12: Valiant Progress

A moment later, Zhang Yu emerged from the Immortal Resonance Group's office building looking pale and hunched over, the very picture of weakness.

However, a few kilometers away from the skyscraper, his complexion gradually began to return to normal after he boarded the subway.

As he began to circulate the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method, the mana within him surged forth like countless streams, instantly permeating every fiber of his being.

The once runaway mana was guided back onto its proper course by these surging currents, merging into the intricate circulatory network within his body and resuming its endless, natural flow.

Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method Level 1 (0/20)

A faint smile touched Zhang Yu’s lips as he looked at the technique that had appeared in the Feathered Tome.

_I really can master it._

_If I hadn't mastered this Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method, it probably would have taken a week or two for the runaway mana to dissipate._

His confidence in the Feathered Tome was the entire reason he had dared to accept the technique-testing job.

He had been careful, however, not to reveal his ability to master the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method while at the Immortal Resonance Group.

_Although this is just a breathing technique for beginners, once mastered, it can operate on its own twenty-four hours a day, without rest._

_Even without actively circulating it, it has thirty percent of the efficiency of active circulation. After mastering it… doing nothing all day is equivalent to someone else performing breathing exercises for more than seven hours._

_And that's just its effect at Level 1._

_If this technique is successfully developed, it would instantly become one of the best-selling breathing techniques on the market._

Zhang Yu knew that, apart from the various cultivation techniques taught in schools, the techniques from large corporations and major sects were all copyrighted, requiring payment for purchase and representing immense profits.

It was precisely because the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method was so potent—and because he saw it as a development project of extreme importance to the Immortal Resonance Group—that he was unwilling to expose the fact he had mastered it, lest he invite unnecessary trouble.

The technique was also incredibly difficult to cultivate. In Zhang Yu's view, without the guidance of the auxiliary equipment, a first-year high school student could not even dream of mastering it, let alone completing a single full circulation.

This made him even more reluctant to reveal that he had mastered the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method.

In order to master the technique, Zhang Yu had switched the Feathered Tome's specialization from the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms to this new breathing technique.

Although this meant the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms could no longer be rapidly improved for the time being, the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method was now on the fast track.

_A Level 3 Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms is sufficient for now._

_From now on, I will focus on improving this Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method._

Aside from gaining the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method, the biggest reward from this endeavor was the payment from the Immortal Resonance Group.

Ten thousand yuan, plus the additional three thousand, came to a total payment of 13,000.

In that moment, Zhang Yu's savings soared to thirteen thousand seven hundred yuan.

Unfortunately, after he used ten thousand yuan to repay loans on multiple platforms, his savings instantly dropped to three thousand seven hundred.

Fortunately, after paying back the ten thousand, the frequency of collection attempts dropped considerably, and it was unlikely they would escalate their methods anytime soon.

The countdown timer that then sounded in his mind quickly cut short Zhang Yu's reverie, forcing him to refocus his attention and circulate the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method.

---

A night passed in the blink of an eye.

At the entrance to Songyang High School, Zhang Yu checked the changes on the Feathered Tome as he walked.

Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method Level 1 (0/20) → Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method Level 1 (11/20)

His mana, thanks to his previous hard work and his recent diligence with the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method, had also increased.

Mana 7.7 → 7.8

_It really is running passively. Last night, I only completed five celestial cycles before sleeping, counting as five repetitions._

_But when I woke up this morning, it had increased to eight repetitions, and after actively circulating it on my way to school, it rose to the eleventh._

As he did the math, Zhang Yu was secretly overjoyed. Compared to the thirteen thousand yuan, the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method was yesterday's greatest gain.

He now resolved to raise the level of this Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method first.

Naturally, he also decided to keep the Feathered Tome's specialization set on the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method.

Unfortunately, this morning brought another double period of physical education.

Walking toward the training grounds, Zhang Yu felt a slight sense of regret.

_Sigh, time to practice the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms again._

_My specialization is now the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method; I should be cultivating this breathing technique._

The moment Zhang Yu entered the training ground, he saw several young giants with muscles bulging like marble, injecting themselves one needle at a time.

This was followed by a series of explosive cracks, all kinds of beast-like roars, and the clang of equipment as the students of the model class began to train with fiery enthusiasm.

Just then, a student looked at Wang Hai in shock, "N-no... impossible. My cousin sold this to me..."

Wang Hai shook his head, crushing the syringe in his hand to powder with a _crack_ before tossing it into the trash can.

"Have you seen any change in your body weight these past two weeks? There are no signs of growth in your muscles or organs. Your physical strength has only increased by 0.03 in two weeks—the pathetic results of natural body tempering. It's obvious you bought counterfeit drugs."

Saying this, he turned from the crestfallen student and raised his voice.

"How many times have I told you all? You must buy your drugs through proper channels. The supply from your school teachers is undoubtedly the safest."

"If you buy counterfeit or expired drugs just to save a little money, you'll lose more than you gain. You're only wasting your own time."

After lecturing the students, Wang Hai's gaze swept over to Zhang Yu, who was practicing body tempering in a corner.

As he looked at Zhang Yu, he recalled the results from Zhang Yu's latest test.

"Level 0.85? An increase of 0.02 in three days?"

_Zhang Yu wasn't even this fast back when he was injecting himself daily, was he?_

Based on Wang Hai's years of coaching experience, with such a rapid increase in physical strength, it was impossible that Zhang Yu was progressing naturally without pills or injections as he claimed; he must have been secretly taking something before class.

_Not only is this not natural body tempering, but the drugs he's using must be extremely potent to get these results. The damage to his body must be immense._

The possibility that Zhang Yu had reached the third level of the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms and had undertaken hellish training at his limits all on his own never even crossed Wang Hai's mind.

Regardless, in Wang Hai's eyes, the current Zhang Yu was increasingly challenging his authority in the classroom.

In particular, this raised a question: where was Zhang Yu getting his drugs?

Would other students see his results and seek out the same source?

If that happened, wouldn't it affect his sales figures?

The thought of the cutthroat market for body tempering drugs instantly set Wang Hai's nerves on edge.

_A second-year teacher? A third-year?_

_Or did an off-campus tutor guide him?_

_Are they trying to sell their goods on my turf?_

As for Zhang Yu himself, Wang Hai saw him as just a pawn. What he most wanted to figure out now was who was behind him.

However, the influence in the class still had to be erased.

So, a moment later, Wang Hai gave a few instructions to a student named Zhao Tianxing.

Zhao Tianxing then walked over to Zhang Yu and said, "Zhang Yu, Teacher Wang asked me to check with you, are you sure you're not buying any more drugs?"

After seeing Zhang Yu nod, Zhao Tianxing scratched his head and said sheepishly, "Well... Teacher told me to say that, in order not to disturb the others' training, he'd like you to practice alone in the small room off to the side. Is that okay?"

After being instructed by Wang Hai, Zhao Tianxing understood that Wang Hai wanted to further isolate Zhang Yu.

He looked at Zhang Yu with a trace of pity in his eyes, but his actions showed no hesitation.

As one of Wang Hai's so-called good, obedient students, it was precisely because Zhao Tianxing had completely accepted Wang Hai's guidance, purchased all the recommended drugs, and added his own hard work that he had managed to break through to a physical strength of Level 1.00, becoming one of the top ten students in the class for physical strength.

Therefore, he had always been obedient to the physical education teacher, Wang Hai.

Worried that Zhang Yu might react poorly, however, he spoke very politely, adding after a moment, "Why don't you just buy some? Teacher Wang's supplies are very high quality. Natural body tempering really isn't enough..."

But to Zhao Tianxing's surprise, Zhang Yu agreed to go train elsewhere without the slightest hesitation.

Watching his retreating figure, Zhao Tianxing scratched his head.

_Sigh, Zhang Yu is so stubborn. Couldn't he just apologize to the teacher, admit his mistake, and get on with class? To ruin his future over a moment of impulse._

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu entered the small room, let out a soft laugh, and sat down, immediately beginning to practice the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method.

Wisps of spiritual energy flowed into the sea of qi in his dantian, where Zhang Yu refined them drop by drop into mana.

Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method Level 1 (11/20) → Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method Level 1 (16/20)

In the blink of an eye, five celestial cycles were completed, and the two physical education periods were over.

But during the following Chinese and math classes, Zhang Yu remained in the classroom, engrossed in circulating the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method.

The long process of absorbing spiritual energy and refining mana was naturally a tedious affair.

His waist, abdomen, and shoulders would ache, his skin would itch, and his mind would grow weary from the monotony.

Even the old Zhang Yu would have been unable to resist taking a break after one or two hours of breathing exercises, standing up to walk around, or perhaps scratching an itch or his head.

But now, compelled by the ritual's power and encouraged by the changing numbers on the Feathered Tome, Zhang Yu forced himself to endure, finally completing the twentieth repetition of the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method in a single stretch.

Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method Level 2 (0/40)

The experience of circulating the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method countless times bloomed in Zhang Yu's mind, and he could feel the mana circulation within him become more complex, intricate, and powerful.

When Zhang Yu stopped, the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method continued to operate, but its speed was now slightly faster than before.

_At Level 1, the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method's passive breathing has only thirty percent of the speed of active breathing._

_But after reaching Level 2, the passive breathing speed has increased to thirty-five percent of the active speed._

_As for actively circulating the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method, the breathing efficiency has also improved significantly, far surpassing my original Level 1 Basic Breathing Technique._

Zhang Yu nodded slightly, feeling a sense of satisfaction. This was, after all, a constant, day-and-night improvement.

So after lunch, he redoubled his efforts and continued to improve the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method.

In the time that followed, he poured nearly every available moment into the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method.

The study of the Immortal Dao in high school was both boring and difficult, and Zhang Yu, compelled by the ritual's power, had no time for rest. Only by watching the numbers for the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method tick upward and imagining the long-term benefits of its passive effect could he find some small measure of mental comfort.

As the saying goes, if you can't fight it, you might as well enjoy it.

So, he cultivated the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method during physical education class.

He cultivated the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method during Chinese class.

He was still cultivating the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method during his lunch break.

While waiting for work in the square at night, he continued to cultivate the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method, though unfortunately, he found no work for three days.

Needless to say, when he went home to sleep, the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method was still operating on its own.

In just three short days, the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method was raised to Level 4 (5/80).

His mana also advanced valiantly with his hard work, increasing from 7.8 to 8.3.

At this point, the passive breathing speed of the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method had already reached forty-five percent of the active breathing speed.
