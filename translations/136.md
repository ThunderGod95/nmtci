# Chapter 134: Le and Bai Take Turns, Rapid Advancement

Le Mulan said with great interest, "What kind of alchemical enhancer are you looking for? Body tempering? Or one that boosts mana? I can take some more before I come next time."

Zhang Yu gave her a strange look and said, "What are you up to?"

Le Mulan thought to herself, _I just want to see if you can hold out and not drink my sweat._

Thinking of how he had once refused 400,000 during the martial arts competition.

Le Mulan felt that if she voiced this curiosity of hers, he would probably refuse her directly.

So she decided to secretly increase the value of the fluid, just to see if Zhang Yu would ultimately change his mind... and drink it.

The thought flashed through her mind, and Le Mulan continued, "Your service is good, so for me, it's just a small effort. I don't mind helping you out."

Zhang Yu thought for a moment and said, "I've been focusing on body tempering recently."

Le Mulan nodded. "Understood. Before I come next time, I'll inject my body with ten vials of Bone and Flesh Enhancement Serum."

"This is a body tempering enhancer that's normally only injectable in the late stages of Qi Refinement, but for someone like me with super-metabolism, it's just right. You can even use it after I metabolize it."

"The Bone and Flesh Enhancement Serum can effectively increase bone density, improve the repair efficiency of muscle fibers, and enhance the absorption of spiritual energy and nutrients."

"Each vial costs ten thousand yuan."

"Oral application is more effective than topical."

Seeing his stunned expression, Le Mulan smiled faintly, a newfound sense of anticipation for their next training session blooming in her heart.

She wanted to know if Zhang Yu would actually drink the fluid next time.

Opening the door and seeing Bai Zhenzhen already waiting outside, Le Mulan gave a nod and turned to leave.

The moment Bai Zhenzhen entered the room, her gaze fell upon the puddle on the floor.

Standing to the side, Zhang Yu watched Bai Zhenzhen begin to lick her lips and said with a roll of his eyes, "Zhen, you can't lick that!"

Bai Zhenzhen said with a regretful expression, "Isn't that a waste, Yu-boy? You can tell this stuff is high-end just by the smell. It's very valuable; one lick would be worth at least a few dozen yuan."

"You can't get arrogant just because you've made a little money and forget how to be frugal. We're still poor."

Zhang Yu advised, "You can't be willing to do anything for money."

Bai Zhenzhen said nonchalantly, "Money can buy anything, so what can't you do for money?"

Zhang Yu was somewhat speechless, because in Kunxu, you really could buy anything with money.

He could only change his approach. "Zhen, you lower your standards one step at a time. Today we're willing to lick a rich person's sweat to save a little money. Does that mean tomorrow we'll have to become a rich person's dog?"

"Remember back at the Mana Competition when you told me not to gamble? It's the same thing. One step back leads to falling back again and again."

As he spoke, Zhang Yu showed off the peculiar fragrance still emanating from the fluid on his body and said, "If you really want to try it, just rub some off the floor, or off me."

"Fine." Bai Zhenzhen nodded. "You have a point. I'll just rub some off you then."

Bai Zhenzhen ran her hand over Zhang Yu's arm, then smeared the fluid onto her own body.

Zhang Yu then pointed to a bag on the floor nearby, telling Bai Zhenzhen that it contained the enhancers he had bought from Le Mulan, which she had conveniently brought over today.

Then Zhang Yu swallowed one of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pills in a single gulp, feeling the medicinal power of 24,000 yuan dissolving into his body.

"I need to hurry and temper my body while the effects are active. Zhen, let me borrow the True Spiritual Root for a while."

"Okay."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded and pressed herself against Zhang Yu's back.

While inhaling the medicinal fragrance coming from his body, trying to rub as much of the fluid onto herself as possible, she sent the spiritual root into Zhang Yu's body.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu was immersed in the cultivation of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

First, the fluid from Le Mulan's body continuously seeped into his, helping him recover his stamina and energy while enhancing the effects of his training.

Then, the medicinal power of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill spread through his limbs and bones, increasing the strength of his flesh, blood, and bones with every cycle of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

Next was the operation of the Great Sun Sea of Qi, which constantly accelerated his metabolism, speeding up his absorption of the enhancers and hastening the transformation of his flesh and blood.

And after Zhang Yu used the Crippled Ox Body-Sacrifice Heart Art to further quiet his own mind and reduce mental exertion, his body's metabolism accelerated even more.

Finally, there was the True Spiritual Root, continuously drawing in and expelling spiritual energy, assisting the cultivation of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi while nourishing Zhang Yu's flesh, blood, sinews, bones, and nerves, drop by drop...

Under layer upon layer of enhancement, Zhang Yu's physical strength was being pushed to frantic new heights.

At this moment, he thought of nothing, contemplated nothing; he just cycled the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi over and over again, feeling his physical strength constantly increasing, feeling his mortal body grow stronger and stronger.

And within Purple Cloud High School.

A few students looked at the faint bruises on Le Mulan's wrist and said with faces full of envy, "Has the divine number one student gone for combat training again?"

Another student said, his face green with jealousy, "To be the divine number one's sparring partner... and to be able to leave a mark on her. I wouldn't even dare to dream of something so wonderful."

Not far away, Lian Tianji overheard their conversation, a trace of disdain on his face as he thought to himself, _A bunch of spineless fools._

_What's there not to dare to dream about?_

...

The next day.

There was no training with Le Mulan today.

Instead, in the room, Bai Zhenzhen could be seen taking out a row of syringes, channeling her mana into them, and then her hands became a series of afterimages as she injected them one by one into various parts of Zhang Yu's body.

This was precisely the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique that Bai Zhenzhen had learned from the competition team.

In order to pass the Foundation Establishment certification exam and to further increase his physical strength, Zhang Yu had finally chosen to use alchemical enhancers.

Of course, this was also because his internal organs were now much stronger, and much of the medicinal poison that had previously accumulated in his body had... already been expelled during his cultivation of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

So Zhang Yu decided to try the enhancers, and if his body felt any discomfort, he would stop.

The enhancers he injected were purchased through a channel introduced by Le Mulan at a 20% discount, costing 10,500, but this was still cheaper than the prices from the competition team.

After all, Bai Zhenzhen had done a comparison; with the team's benefits, the cheapest enhancers were only discounted by 10%, and the more expensive ones were only discounted by 2%, far less cost-effective than Le Mulan's connection.

Speaking of which, Zhang Yu still remembered a benefit from the competition team: after winning first place in the athletics meet, he was eligible for a 20,000 yuan subsidy for purchasing a body tempering cultivation technique.

However, Zhang Yu had no plans to change his body tempering cultivation technique for the time being, so he decided to claim this subsidy later when he was ready to switch.

At this moment, each needle was inserted by Bai Zhenzhen with a different rhythm and at a different point, supplemented by mana oscillation to drive the medicinal power deep into Zhang Yu's muscles and bones.

After a full set of the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique, Zhang Yu could feel 10,500 yuan worth of medicinal fees being pushed into his flesh and blood, frantically nourishing his body.

At the same time, as his blood and qi surged, Zhang Yu also felt his body become sharper, more sensitive, and able to perceive his own physical form with greater precision.

The moment Bai Zhenzhen finished performing the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique, she hugged Zhang Yu tightly from behind, intending to send over the spiritual root.

Who knew that the instant she hugged him, Zhang Yu suddenly bent over, leaving Bai Zhenzhen with a look of utter confusion.

Because at the exact moment Bai Zhenzhen embraced him, Zhang Yu suddenly felt a peculiar sensation.

He was startled. _Is it because Zhen is wearing less today?_

Then he realized...

_No, it's me who's wearing less._

At this moment, Zhang Yu had no shirt on to make the injections easier.

And Zhang Yu could feel Bai Zhenzhen, wearing only a t-shirt, pressing herself tightly against him.

The barrier of a single thin layer of clothing did nothing to block Zhang Yu's perception of the force of Bai Zhenzhen's embrace.

Every point of pressure, every point of contact, even allowed him to perfectly construct a mental image of the contours of her body pressing against his.

The pressure from her abdomen, her stomach, her slender arms, and other places...

Especially as Zhang Yu bent over, the friction between them... stirred a distracting itch in his heart.

Zhang Yu finally realized that this was the sensitivity brought on by the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique.

_Damn it, no wonder they want you to sever your root. How can you train when you're this sensitive?_

At this moment, Zhang Yu had become a staunch supporter of Songyang High School's policy.

Of course, he himself didn't need it, because he had a firm will and extreme self-discipline to overcome the distracting thoughts in his mind.

For example, at this very moment, he was able to say with righteous conviction, "Zhen, get off as soon as you've sent the spiritual root over. You're disturbing my training."

Bai Zhenzhen sent the spiritual root into Zhang Yu's body and asked curiously, "Why are you bent over like that?"

Suddenly, she understood, and looked at Zhang Yu with contempt. 

"Look at you. I told you to get your root severed long ago, but you insisted on keeping it. If you fail to get your Foundation Establishment certificate in the future, it'll be all this damned root's fault."

Zhang Yu waved his hand and said, "It's fine. I have a supreme will. A mere distracting thought is not worth me spending money to suppress."

With that, he began to circulate the Crippled Ox Body-Sacrifice Heart Art, feeling as if he had transformed into a severely crippled ox, forging ahead valiantly through a sea of mud.

A moment later, Zhang Yu let out a long breath, feeling the medicinal power boiling throughout his body, and immediately seized the time to practice the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

...

Just like that, if Le Mulan was there, he would use her fluid; on days without Le Mulan, he would have Bai Zhenzhen perform the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique.

Alternating between these two methods, Zhang Yu could feel his physical strength increasing by leaps and bounds every day.

And Bai Zhenzhen also gained a lot of benefits in the process, such as getting second-hand medicinal fluid and buying cheap body tempering enhancers.

Especially with the rotational use of the True Spiritual Root, every time the root re-entered her body, Bai Zhenzhen would feel a scorching heat from within.

That was the True Spiritual Root gradually beginning to develop the ability to absorb the essence of the sun and moon as it constantly adapted to Zhang Yu, allowing Bai Zhenzhen to also absorb spiritual energy from the light.

And in the small apartment they rented, unknowingly, more and more searchlights bought by Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen appeared, illuminating the entire room brightly every night, allowing the Great Sun Sea of Qi and the True Spiritual Root to absorb more spiritual energy from them.

Time flew by, and soon it was early May.

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen also gradually realized that if they wanted to reach their goal by August, the rate of improvement for their mana and Dao hearts was still not fast enough.

So on this day, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen came to a protected reserve 90 kilometers from the center of Songyang City, because they had arranged to meet Xiong Wenwu here to discuss the matter of a spirit vein.

# Chapter 135: The Difficulty of Breathing

On the pedestrian path of the highway.

Two figures, one in front of the other, kicked up gusts of wind as they sped all the way towards the spiritual energy reserve.

It was Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

However, at this moment, besides Zhang Yu using his Sports Car Legs to travel at high speed.

Flashes of electricity sparked around Bai Zhenzhen's body from time to time as she used her newly learned Electric Light Step to keep up with Zhang Yu.

Unlike Zhang Yu, who focused on improving his physical strength, Bai Zhenzhen, because she was participating in the martial arts track, had spent more of her energy during this period on practicing martial cultivation techniques, in addition to improving her Dao heart, mana, and physical strength.

This Electric Light Step was a combat cultivation technique that allowed Bai Zhenzhen to move at high speed over short distances in battle. It was more agile than Sports Car Legs, more adaptable, and more explosive, making the technique more suitable for combat. At this moment, she was simply using it to travel and practice at the same time.

And under the sunlight, Bai Zhenzhen could feel a faint warm current flowing continuously within her body; that was the True Spiritual Root absorbing the spiritual energy from the light.

However, the True Spiritual Root had now gradually adapted to light and dark adjustments and could understand Bai Zhenzhen's intentions, so it wouldn't make her skin dark.

Under the sunlight, Zhang Yu, on the other hand, felt as if molten lava was flowing throughout his body as he frantically absorbed the spiritual energy from the solar radiance descending from the sky.

At the same time, he was doing some calculations in his head.

This trip to the spiritual energy reserve was to see if he could rent a spot on a spirit vein for a cheaper price through Xiong Wenwu's connections to practice his breathing exercises.

After all, these past few days... although his physical strength had increased rapidly, relying solely on cultivation techniques to improve his Dao heart and mana was still too slow for Zhang Yu.

And it was said that not only was the spiritual energy in a spirit vein dense, which could greatly improve the efficiency of mana refinement, but staying there for a long time could also improve one's constitution and prolong life, offering countless benefits.

"Renting an entire spirit vein is definitely out of the question. With the money I have on hand, I'll see if I can rent a spot, just enough for Zhen and me to practice our breathing exercises inside the spirit vein."

Although he had income from the dark world of tutoring, Le Mulan, Yu Xinghan, and Song Hailong during this period, and had also received the first 200,000 in endorsement fees.

However, Zhang Yu's expenses were also considerable. For example, a Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill every three days cost 24,000, and each set of Nine Dragons Acupuncture cost another 10,500. Also, because he had been focusing on body tempering recently, his physical strength was constantly improving, and his food expenses had now reached 1,500 a day. By the beginning of May, he had also paid another 15,000 in loan interest...

Zhang Yu glanced at his account balance again; he still had 570,000.

He thought to himself, _Renting a spot on a spirit vein shouldn't be a problem, right?_

The two continued to speed along, and gradually more and more factories appeared around them, with plumes of white smoke continuously pouring out of huge chimneys. They could also see the signs of Red Pagoda Husbandry on some of the factories.

Just as Zhang Yu's gaze swept over this row of factories, he was suddenly startled. "What is that?"

On the land that was supposed to be a factory, there was now only a field of ruins, with broken walls and rubble everywhere, as if it had gone through a great battle.

There was even a palm print several hundred meters wide on the hillside not far behind, and the hillside was still littered with fragments of various tall towers, walls, and machinery.

Layers of light curtains enveloped the ruins, and various warning signs floated on the light curtains, like the police tape at a murder scene.

Zhang Yu said, "Was there a war?"

Bai Zhenzhen glanced at it and said, "You don't know about this? It was quite a hot topic online six months ago. A factory was investigated for tax evasion."

"The tax evader resisted on the spot, using all sorts of flying swords and magical treasures, and killed more than half of the tax inspectors who came to investigate."

Zhang Yu was shocked. _Tax evaders in Kunxu are this fierce?_

Bai Zhenzhen continued, "Then the tax inspector summoned the divine power of the Tribute Supervising Heavenly God. With a single palm strike, the entire factory was obliterated, and the souls of most of the criminals were torn out."

"Most?" Zhang Yu was amazed. "What about the ones whose souls weren't torn out? Did they die or escape?"

"Those were the ones who committed suicide the moment they saw the Tribute Supervising Heavenly God descend."

Zhang Yu swallowed, once again glad that he hadn't evaded taxes in Kunxu.

The two continued to speed along, and soon they saw a huge arc appear on the distant horizon.

It was their destination.

It was said that a long, long time ago, this spiritual energy reserve was once the territory of demonic beasts, and there were several powerful great demons among them.

The so-called great demons were powerful monsters. Nowadays, monsters are called demon-kin.

Unlike demonic beasts, which were regarded as animals, demon-kin often possessed true intelligence and could integrate into society to live and work.

But later, the great demons here were defeated by the company's security forces. After the reserve changed hands several times, it was finally bought by Red Pagoda Husbandry and has been managed by them ever since.

It was said that it still retained its various natural landscapes and the various demonic beasts that originally lived there. Of course... all of these had also become the assets of Red Pagoda Husbandry.

As Zhang Yu looked closely now, he could see what looked like an incredibly huge glass dome, covering the continuous mountain ranges and hills within.

As the two of them got closer, they could also see dense runes appearing on the glass dome from time to time; that was the power of a formation array separating the inner and outer worlds.

In addition, Zhang Yu could also see many red warning signs on it.

They were all things like 'Red Pagoda Husbandry Private Property, Please Purchase a Ticket and Enter Through the Main Entrance'.

Bai Zhenzhen looked at it and cursed, "So stingy. Are they unwilling to let out even a little bit of the air from the reserve?"

She had originally thought that she might be able to leech some of the spiritual energy and air coming from inside by staying near the border of the reserve, but now it seemed that they had long since taken precautions against this.

The two continued forward and arrived at the ticket office at the main entrance of the spiritual energy reserve.

When they saw that the ticket price was only 5 yuan, both Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu were stunned. What was the difference between this and free? Was Red Pagoda Husbandry doing charity?

Bai Zhenzhen immediately retracted her earlier comment about them being stingy; how was Red Pagoda Husbandry stingy? They were incredibly generous.

The two opened their phones, looking to see if there were any discounts, and were shocked to find that the reserve's rating was only a 1.3.

But after the ticket seller attached the reserve's air meter, spiritual energy monitor, and body weight monitor... to their bodies, they understood why the tickets seemed to be free, and why the rating was so low.

The ticket seller said, "The air inside the reserve is priced at 1,999 yuan per cubic meter, water is 2,888 yuan per liter, and spiritual energy is 3,999 yuan per unit."

"A price list for all the plants and animals, and even the soil, stones, and other materials in the reserve is in the user manual. I'll send it to you, please accept it..."

Zhang Yu looked at the dense list of charges in the user manual and was speechless.

Everything in this spiritual energy reserve, whether it was air, water, food, or anything else, cost money. An ordinary person could bankrupt themselves by just picking up a few stones.

Bai Zhenzhen said nervously, "Yu-boy, breathe less when we go in later. This is too expensive."

After buying their tickets, the two first entered a sealed cabin. As the rear cabin door closed, they were completely cut off from the outside world.

Then, as the front cabin door opened, Zhang Yu felt a wave of incredibly fresh air rush towards him.

Just by taking a deep breath, Zhang Yu felt a sense of comfort throughout his body, and the flesh and blood of his entire body seemed to relax.

"This is... air?"

_Then what have I been breathing before?_

He felt that the air he normally breathed was like car exhaust in comparison.

_So I've been in such a terrible air environment all this time? I've just gotten used to it?_

Zhang Yu walked out of the sealed cabin and completely immersed himself in the reserve's environment.

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Yu felt as if his entire body had been cleansed, and the qi, blood, and mana within him became more active.

Even at this peripheral location, Zhang Yu could feel that the concentration of spiritual energy in the air was already comparable to the spirit-gathering quiet rooms in Songyang High School.

As the two of them walked quickly along the sightseeing path, the spiritual energy in the air became more and more dense. Bai Zhenzhen's spiritual energy charge had even risen to over 500, which scared her so much that she quickly suppressed her True Spiritual Root, telling it not to absorb spiritual energy for the time being.

Zhang Yu also felt that the spiritual energy absorbed by his Great Sun Sea of Qi from the light was more concentrated. Practicing breathing exercises here for one day was probably equivalent to several days of practice outside.

Bai Zhenzhen, on the other hand, patted her chest in fear and said, "This damn place makes it too easy to go bankrupt. Let's meet Xiong Wenwu and get out of here quickly."

Zhang Yu nodded. Staying in this spiritual energy reserve felt more dangerous to him than being in the middle of a gang fight.

_Just breathing and practicing at the outer areas is this expensive. How much would it cost to go to a real spirit vein?_

At this moment, he felt doubtful about whether he could rent a spot on a spirit vein this time.

Especially when he opened the map, he saw that there were a total of three spirit veins in this reserve, running through 7 large areas and more than twenty mountains, but they were all inaccessible to tourists. They were either private territories that had been leased out for a long time, or various pastures, factories, and plantations...

It could be said that all the areas accessible to tourists were on the periphery of the spirit veins.

However, Zhang Yu couldn't even afford the price of long-term breathing and practice in this peripheral area.

"Sigh, ordinary tourists can only enter the reserve and leech off the periphery of the spirit veins to practice their breathing. There's no way to even get in."

At this point, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen were no longer hoping to rent a spot on a spirit vein. He would be satisfied if he could find a way to leech off the air from the periphery of the spirit vein for a cheaper price.

"Let's go see Xiong Wenwu first and see what he has to say."

The place where Xiong Wenwu had arranged to meet them was the breeding base, a remote place located at the edge of the reserve.

The two of them followed the map all the way. As they passed each mountain peak, they could feel waves of spiritual energy shooting up into the sky from the peaks, which were blocked by layers of light curtains and formation arrays. The spiritual energy was so dense that it looked like it was about to rain spiritual energy.

In fact, Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu did see a light rain falling from time to time on the mountain, and the spiritual energy in the rainwater was steaming, which made them secretly click their tongues in amazement.

These mountain peaks were the true locations of the spirit veins.

Unlike the tourist area where Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen were currently walking, which was just the peripheral area of the spirit veins, where they could absorb a little of the air and spiritual energy leaking from above.

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen couldn't imagine what the people on the mountain were doing, that they needed to absorb such a huge amount of spiritual energy, and how much money they were spending every second.

And below the mountain peak, on the side of the tourist area, outside the light curtain that separated the tourists.

Zhang Yu would occasionally see all sorts of poor people carrying oxygen tanks and water bottles, clinging to the foot of the mountain like small fish attached to a whale, absorbing the spiritual energy overflowing from the spirit veins to achieve a cultivation efficiency far exceeding that of the outside world.

No... Zhang Yu denied the thought that had just popped into his head.

_These are not poor people at all. To be able to leech off the foot of the mountain and practice, according to the charges here... they are all rich people to us._

_There are so many damn rich people in Kunxu._

Bai Zhenzhen at the side said, "We should have brought oxygen tanks too. Breathing here is too uneconomical."

Zhang Yu nodded in deep agreement.

Ten minutes later, the two finally arrived at the so-called breeding base.

--

# Chapter 136: The Breeding Base

From the outside, this place looked like a huge factory, completely sealed off from the outside.

And if tourists wanted to visit, they would have to spend another 200 yuan to buy a ticket.

Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, _Damn it... could Xiong Wenwu be trying to boost his sales performance, so he deliberately set the meeting place here?_

Although they were unhappy, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen still spent 400 to buy two tickets and walked into the breeding base.

The moment they entered, the feeling of transparency throughout their bodies, where every breath cleansed their bodies, that they had just experienced in the reserve, disappeared.

In its place was a dry, bitter air.

Zhang Yu said in surprise, "The breeding base isn't connected to the reserve's air? Is this the air we normally breathe?"

Bai Zhenzhen sighed in her heart, "The demonic beasts in this reserve can't even get a few mouthfuls of the air their ancestors breathed."

Just then, a deep voice rang out, "Long time no see, Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen."

Zhang Yu turned his head and saw a tall figure already waiting for them; it was Xiong Wenwu from Red Pagoda High School.

Seeing the two looking over, Xiong Wenwu said, "Let's talk while we look around. Can't waste the ticket money."

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen followed him to the first stop of the breeding base—the incubation room.

On both sides of the corridor, in row after row of transparent rooms, were all sorts of different types of demonic beasts. The only thing they had in common was that these demonic beasts were all incubating what looked like dragon eggs.

However, half of the rooms seemed to be empty and were not in use.

"So this is a demonic beast breeding base."

Bai Zhenzhen looked at the various demonic beasts in the incubation room as if she were at a zoo, and suddenly pointed to a bear and said, "Haha, Xiong Wenwu, look, doesn't that bear look like you before your transformation?"

Xiong Wenwu looked at incubation room number 33, where a huge demonic bear was lying on the ground, sleeping and snoring.

Xiong Wenwu said flatly, "That's my mom."

"Huh?" Bai Zhenzhen's mind went blank.

Xiong Wenwu looked at the two of them and said, "The breeding base will find suitable mothers from among the demonic beasts, and then sow true dragon bloodlines to create offspring containing the dragon bloodline."

"I heard they used to use incubators directly, but later the company decided that demonic beast mothers were cheaper, and the breeding base's output didn't need to be too high, so in the end, they found us real mothers."

"After all, there are plenty of demonic beasts in the reserve, so it's very convenient to catch them."

Xiong Wenwu looked at the demonic beast in the incubation room and said flatly, "Although she is my mother, she is just a demonic beast with little intelligence, and she doesn't recognize me anymore."

Having never encountered such a conversation before, Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu were both stunned and didn't know what to say.

In silence, the three of them came to the newborn area.

In incubator after incubator were demon-kin infants of various different appearances.

Some were fast asleep, some were looking outside with wide eyes, and some were being injected in the back with a syringe and were wailing loudly.

Xiong Wenwu said flatly, "The infants here will continuously receive injections of various enhancers. Those who cannot withstand the medicinal power will be eliminated..."

Then there was the study room, where demon-kin infants were seriously watching a screen. What was playing was the nursery version of Red Pagoda Husbandry's new employee training, which taught how to care for the company as if it were home.

Bai Zhenzhen exclaimed in shock, "They're actually getting a damn nursery version of employee training?"

Zhang Yu nodded slightly, thinking that this Red Pagoda Husbandry was too ridiculous.

But then Bai Zhenzhen continued, "They have a job right from birth? A lot of people on the outside would be envious of that treatment, wouldn't they?"

Xiong Wenwu said with a somewhat proud tone, "The company will provide a job for every demon-kin born in the breeding base. They can receive employee training from a young age and be instilled with the company spirit."

"Because of this, every year there are mortals who come to protest, wanting to send their own children into the breeding base to study with us."

Walking a few steps further, they saw a group of demon-kin infants doing exercises while shouting slogans: Hand in hand, we create the future together. The light of a father's love shines on you and me.

In front of them was a portrait of a Black Dragon, who seemed to be the school director of Red Pagoda High School.

As they continued on, they could see that the demon-kin were getting older and older. From employee training to general education, and after rounds of exams and streaming, more and more demon-kin were assigned to work to repay their breeding debts, and the number of demon-kin who remained to continue their studies became smaller and smaller.

Xiong Wenwu continued, "Originally, a large number of demon-kin could be produced here every year. They would either study hard, get into university, and become valuable assets for Red Pagoda Husbandry."

"Or they would be directly streamed to work in the company, conscientiously becoming the cornerstone of Red Pagoda Husbandry."

"But since the introduction of new technology from Oasis Group, the company has decided to change its business direction. A large number of pastures and factories have been acquired by Oasis Group, and this breeding base will probably be phased out soon."

Xiong Wenwu knew that for the demon-kin who had lived and worked here all their lives, leaving Red Pagoda... was more terrifying than going to work in a factory.

However, as a mere first-year high school student, he couldn't change anything. The only thing he could do was to try to take care of the people he cared about.

Walking and stopping along the way, the three of them came to the finishing room.

In the rooms on both sides of the corridor, seventeen-year-old demon-kin were studying at their desks.

They wore shock collars around their necks to keep them awake and relieve fatigue.

The chains on their feet were connected to their desks, representing their determination to study wherever they went.

The feeder in front of them had an automatic feeding function, which would automatically feed them after they completed a piece of homework as required.

Xiong Wenwu looked at this scene, a trace of nostalgia flashing across his face, and said, "This is for studying the three years of high school general knowledge courses, in preparation for the breeding base's middle school graduation exam."

"After all, whether they can enter high school next year will determine whether they will study or work in the future, so everyone is very serious about their studies."

Zhang Yu thought to himself... _Damn it, if they don't study, they'll starve, won't they?_

Recalling what he had seen and heard after entering the reserve, Zhang Yu couldn't help but sigh in his heart, _This company really... squeezes every last drop out of people, and then grinds them under its heel for good measure._

As they reached the latter part of the tour, Xiong Wenwu brought up the matter of the spirit vein.

"In the breeding base's incubation room, in order to ensure the growth of the infants and the true dragon bloodline, a spirit vein pipe has been introduced, which has air and high concentrations of spiritual energy from within the spirit vein."

"But only the incubation room has this condition, so someone needs to arrange for you to sneak in."

Bai Zhenzhen asked in surprise, "Won't we be discovered?"

Xiong Wenwu at the side shook his head. "Most of the breeding base is automated, and there is only one person in charge. As long as this person agrees, no one will find out about you leeching off the spirit vein."

Zhang Yu pointed to the meter on his body and asked, "What about this?"

Xiong Wenwu said, "The breeding base is at the edge of the reserve. There is a material transport channel to the outside here. I have already cleared the way and confirmed that there are no problems. Next time, I will bring you in directly through that channel."

Only then did Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen notice that Xiong Wenwu didn't seem to have any meters on him at all.

Xiong Wenwu reminded them again, "But if you come in through that channel, you can only stay in the breeding base. Don't go out. The reserve's surveillance methods are too numerous; you will definitely be discovered."

Zhang Yu asked again, "Then what's the price?"

Xiong Wenwu said, "8,000 an hour."

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen looked at each other, both feeling that this price was not expensive.

After all, according to the prices in the reserve outside, with their constitutions, just breathing for an hour without practicing would cost several thousand, not to mention that this was air and dense spiritual energy from a spirit vein.

Bai Zhenzhen asked again, "Why did you choose to deal with us?"

"I asked around, you two are very poor, right?" Xiong Wenwu smiled. "I don't trust people who are too rich. And you two are the only ones who are this poor and still have designs on a spirit vein, and who came to ask me about it... so I don't really have a choice."

Xiong Wenwu continued, "Now there's one last problem, which is that the only employee of this breeding base may not agree to this deal."

"The person I'm taking you to see in a moment is her."

"So I need you to cooperate with me to talk to her."

"Just follow my instructions..."

Hearing Xiong Wenwu's instructions, strange expressions appeared on Zhang Yu's and Bai Zhenzhen's faces.

Arriving at the final souvenir sales area, besides things like employee training manuals, the breeding base's special test papers, a replica shock collar, and various demon-kin dolls, Zhang Yu's gaze also swept over various beast bones, beast blood, and demonic beast meat.

Although demonic beasts had always been treated as animals, completely different from demon-kin, seeing these things here still made Zhang Yu feel a little awkward.

Arriving at the souvenir counter, Xiong Wenwu smiled and greeted, "Sis, I've come to see you."

This was the first time Zhang Yu had seen Xiong Wenwu's barbaric face smile so happily.

But looking at the small panda behind the counter, Zhang Yu's face still showed a look of confusion. However, thinking that the demon-kin of Red Pagoda High School always addressed each other as brothers and sisters, it didn't seem so strange.

Xiong Wenwu said to Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, "This is my sister, An'an. When I was young, if she hadn't helped me learn to read, I might have been eliminated long ago."

"She has some opportunities to leech off the spirit vein here that she can introduce to you."

But the small panda behind the counter didn't seem to agree with what Xiong Wenwu said.

She raised her hands high, her face flushed with anger, and said, "Xiong Wenwu! What are you doing! I told you I would not betray the company's interests!"

Hearing this, Xiong Wenwu sighed in his heart, a trace of helplessness flashing across his face.
