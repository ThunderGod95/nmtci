# Chapter 525: Good Fortune Relic and Blockade

Within the Supreme Clarity Realm.

Inside the Illusionary Realm in the Side Hall.

Since Zhang Pianpian's Dao Seed, the Great Purity Talisman, had been upgraded to Level 2, the Supreme Clarity Realm now contained this Illusionary Realm, allowing Zhang Yu to simulate real-world objects.

Although his dao heart could only simulate magical artifacts and Bionics up to the Foundation Establishment stage, this was more than sufficient for Zhang Yu's needs.

At this moment, the entire environment, under Zhang Yu's control, gradually transformed into a laboratory — specifically, Ye Xingli's laboratory.

Zhang Yu had been spending nearly every day in Ye Xingli's lab recently, familiarizing himself with its layout and equipment. The simulation within the Illusionary Realm was remarkably lifelike.

However, many of the devices were merely shells. Having never used them himself, Zhang Yu didn't know their functions and couldn't truly simulate them within the Illusionary Realm.

In the next instant, as the Four-Headed White Bull roared in Zhang Yu's mind, he split into four figures within the Illusionary Realm, each approaching a different experimental workbench.

At the same time, a magical artifact design blueprint appeared before Zhang Yu, detailing an artifact called the Good Fortune Relic.

This was a common magical artifact used by company employees, often distributed free of charge by their employers.

When equipped with the Good Fortune Relic, an employee's communication with the Spirit Realm Network was fully monitored, and their bodily data was collected in real-time.

If the Relic detected any violation of company regulations, it would directly extract the employee's Magic Power as a fine, which would then be distributed as bonuses to the company at the end of the month.

It was said that after implementing the Good Fortune Relic, many companies saw a significant increase in net profits that year, even without any noticeable improvement in revenue.

As a product of Vajra University, the Good Fortune Relic had won the gold medal at the Magic Artifact Design Competition that year.

The design blueprint Zhang Yu was studying wasn't the latest version of the Good Fortune Relic, but an older version stored in the Myriad Laws University's grand library, which he had purchased for study.

Rumor had it that the newest version of the Good Fortune Relic was even more powerful, and its design blueprint was a closely guarded company secret.

Zhang Yu's four streams of consciousness began studying different sections of the Good Fortune Relic's design blueprints.

His purpose wasn't to mass-produce these relics for his employees.

Zhang Yu sought to master the underlying technologies.

Monitoring employee and Spirit Realm Network data exchanges involved Spirit Realm transmission technology and Spirit Realm information defense technology, which could be applied to the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's Spirit Realm defense module to prevent military-grade puppets from being hacked through the Spirit Realm.

Real-time collection of employees' physiological data utilized in-body sensing technology and specialized magic power detection technology, crucial for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's overall puppet monitoring system.

Forcibly extracting magic power as fines employed fully automated magic power refinement technology, a core component of the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's power system.

If Zhang Yu could simulate the Good Fortune Relic's blueprints within the Supreme Clarity Realm and practice with the Feather Book until reaching Level 20, he would naturally gain a deep understanding of these technologies, facilitating the subsequent refinement of the Heavenly Sun Radiance God prototype machine.

By mastering each of these magical artifacts one by one, I can gain complete control over all the technologies required for the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

As Zhang Yu studied the design blueprints, various textbooks from the Artifact Refinement Department continuously popped up around him.

After all, he hadn't yet completed his Artifact Refinement Department courses, so he had to self-study any unfamiliar concepts in the blueprints.

However, once he grasped the basics well enough to refine a complete Good Fortune Relic, he could repeatedly practice using the Feather Book, continuously increasing its practice count.

Then, by forcibly raising his Refinement Level, he could thoroughly master all the knowledge and techniques involved in the process.

The Supreme Clarity Realm began to operate at full speed. Under a 20x acceleration, Zhang Yu, equipped with the Artifact Refinement Prodigy talent, split his consciousness into four streams, frantically absorbing everything before him.

After several hours, Zhang Yu felt he had fully digested the blueprints. He began simulating the creation of White Bone Relics, preparing to practice refining the Good Fortune Relic within the Illusionary Realm.

In the following days, Zhang Yu devoted himself entirely to his studies, spending nearly all his free time immersed in the Supreme Clarity Realm.

When Zhang Yu arrived at True Monarch Magnetic Pole's laboratory that day, he saw a circular, crystal-like object orbiting the Soul Transformation Bionic under her control.

Curious, Zhang Yu asked, "Teacher, what is this?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled. "This is an experimental prototype I created. It's not yet complete, but it seems capable of stimulating the vital energy within the Soul Transformation Bionic."

Having participated in these experiments for so long, Zhang Yu knew that True Monarch Magnetic Pole had divided the process of deciphering the Soul Transformation Bionic into four stages: free control, understanding the principles, laboratory creation, and ultimately, mass production.

Within the free control stage, True Monarch Magnetic Pole had set five objectives: Magic Power exchange, vital energy exchange, memory exchange, knowledge exchange, and cultivation exchange.

Each objective was more challenging than the last. The final goal, cultivation exchange, required not only absorbing another's cultivation through the Soul Transformation Bionic but also enhancing their cultivation.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole had already achieved the Magic Power exchange objective.

Now, it seemed she was nearing success with vital energy exchange.

"Congratulations, Teacher," Zhang Yu said.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied calmly, "I must thank you for the reminder. This prototype was created by mimicking your physical characteristics to create a Yang Artifact Bionic. It successfully deceived the Soul Transformation Bionic, making it believe this object was you."

Zhang Yu's gaze flickered as he studied the spherical crystal floating in mid-air. Teacher has successfully refined it, but why couldn't I replicate the Dao Seed? Could it be...?

"Is this Bionic's refinement level too low?" Zhang Yu asked.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole glanced at Zhang Yu with surprise. "You have a keen eye. It seems your progress has improved significantly since switching departments."

"This Bionic is currently only at Refinement Level 11."

Zhang Yu replied, "Then it seems we need to further increase its refinement level to successfully achieve the vital energy exchange goal?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole shook her head. "The Bionic itself still has room for design optimization. There's no need to push the first prototype to such a high refinement level."

With a smile, she grabbed Zhang Yu by the arm. "Let me see what other areas can be optimized."

Feeling himself being held in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's grasp, treated like an experimental animal at her whim, Zhang Yu forced a smile and cooperated with his teacher.

Whenever he recalled this lack of agency, Zhang Yu reminded himself that one must have money and power.

"Good, keep still," True Monarch Magnetic Pole instructed. "Don't move."

"As long as you're satisfied, Teacher," Zhang Yu replied.

"You've started learning the Heavenly Sun Radiance God technique, haven't you?" True Monarch Magnetic Pole asked. "With your overall department ranking, you should apply for a project loan from the school. Don't forget."

Outside the city.

On this rare day, Zhang Yu ventured to the construction site, employing the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power for the project.

Just as he finished his work and was about to return, a somewhat familiar figure blocked his path.

"Feng Yuhuan?"

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened as he recognized Feng Yuhuan, the director of the Research Department at the school.

It was Feng Yuhuan who had previously proposed surveillance and containment measures against Zhang Yu, attempting to keep him confined to the school or even locked in the laboratory. True Monarch Magnetic Pole, Director Gao, and Zhang Yu had ultimately refuted these proposals before Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations.

Knowing that this school administrator had long been at odds with True Monarch Magnetic Pole, Zhang Yu immediately grew wary upon seeing him.

Feng Yuhuan said calmly, "Student Zhang Yu."

In the next moment, spiritual light flashed across the heavens and earth, and chains materialized from thin air, completely sealing off a thousand-meter radius.

Within this sealed area, not only did spiritual energy nearly cease to flow, making it impossible for Zhang Yu to mobilize even a trace of it, but the exchange of information with the Spirit Realm also came to a halt, completely severing Zhang Yu's connection to the Spirit Realm.

Sensing that even the Earthly Fiend Gravity was unresponsive, Zhang Yu was forced to descend to the ground.

Frowning, Zhang Yu asked, "Teacher Feng, is there something you need?"

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu activated the Sun-Moon Sky-Piercing Bracelet, intending to send a message to True Monarch Magnetic Pole, but the message failed to send immediately.

He then tried sending messages to others, but all attempts failed.

"Is the Sun-Moon Sky-Piercing Bracelet malfunctioning?"

Zhang Yu knew the bracelet could directly connect to the sun and moon in the sky, known as Sun-Patrolling Falling Darkness and Long Night Jade Palace respectively, thereby establishing a direct link to the Spirit Realm.

"Is Feng Yuhuan behind this?"

As if reading Zhang Yu's thoughts, Feng Yuhuan said calmly, "Don't be nervous. I've come today with good news."

"I heard True Monarch Magnetic Pole successfully established a connection with the Soul Transformation Bionic, using biomimicry technology to create a Bionic that perfectly replicates you."

"My side would like to purchase the key organ from your body to facilitate laboratory management."

Without giving Zhang Yu any choice, Feng Yuhuan spoke as if issuing a direct order.

Zhang Yu paused slightly, thinking, "This guy... did he hear about Teacher's progress and come to steal the results?"

Zhang Yu replied, "I have no intention of selling any organs from my body."

Feng Yuhuan seemed completely unconcerned by Zhang Yu's answer, simply stating, "You're just a third-year student. It's understandable that you might not fully grasp the laboratory's regulations."

"As a technological achievement of Myriad Laws University, you theoretically fall under my jurisdiction."

"However, I understand you have other commitments, so I won't force you to stay on campus. But as the critical organ within your body, I expect you to voluntarily surrender it to protect laboratory property."

"This is my duty, and I hope you'll support the Research Department's work."

Hearing Feng Yuhuan's words, Zhang Yu immediately realized his intentions: "This guy wants to use my organ to seize control of the laboratory?"

Zhang Yu retorted, "True Monarch Magnetic Pole still needs me to improve the Experimental Bionic."

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu tried to contact the outside world through his Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword, but found it was still blocked.

Gazing at the chains that flickered in and out of existence in the atmosphere, Zhang Yu thought, "Feng Yuhuan is at the Nascent Soul stage. With his magical artifact suppressing me, I have no way to break through this blockade."

"What about the Supreme Clarity Realm?"

Zhang Yu then tried putting on his Spirit Realm Mask.

Watching this, Feng Yuhuan said calmly, "Don't waste your efforts. Our conversation today is classified. I don't want anyone to know, so you won't be able to contact anyone."
