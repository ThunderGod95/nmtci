# Chapter 459: Even the Principal Can't Escape

Zhang Yu stood at the prow of the Flying Boat, gazing down at Vajra University below.

There stood an colossal Buddha statue, its head piercing the heavens. Towering over ten thousand meters tall, the golden figure radiated a dazzling light that reflected the sunlight, casting countless golden rays across the land. Even the churning sea of clouds above seemed to glow with a golden hue.

Staring at this colossal Buddha statue, Zhang Yu couldn't help but exclaim, "Vajra University is inside this statue? Does that make it a temple?"

Mo Shangjin's projection beside him scoffed, "How could that be? Buddhism has been gone for centuries. Where would a temple come from?"

Intrigued, Zhang Yu immediately pressed for details.

Mo Shangjin casually explained, "Legend has it that the Buddha Emperor witnessed the Buddha Kings in the Pure Land neglecting their duties, engaging in illegal business practices, causing immense economic losses, and severely disrupting market order."

"In a fit of righteous anger, the Buddha Emperor resolved to abandon his path to enlightenment. He took up the butcher's knife, vowing to cleanse the Buddhist Realm from within."

"Ultimately, the Buddha Emperor withdrew from Buddhism and founded the Vajra Sect, which rose to become one of the Ten Great Sects."

"All Buddhist temples were declared illegal organizations by the Ten Great Sects and brutally shut down. Buddhist monks were branded as unlawful practitioners, and upon discovery, they were sentenced to one to three years of unpaid labor."

"It's said that during that earth-shattering purge of Buddhism, many Buddha Kings from the Buddhist Realm were arrested and imprisoned. Their temples' assets were confiscated and managed by the Ten Great Sects, while related knowledge and technologies were seized by the Heavenly Court to benefit Kunxu."

"Many of the old fleshly bodies were surrendered to public ownership to partially cover war reparations..."

Listening to Mo Shangjin's brief account, Zhang Yu imagined a cataclysmic battle raging across Kunxu, wondering how many lives had been lost and how much destruction it had caused.

Zhang Yu couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "This cursed place Kunxu has seen far too many wars."

He then glanced at the massive golden Buddha statue beneath the Flying Boat and asked, "So this used to be a Buddhist temple? Now it's being used as a university?"

Mo Shangjin shook his head. "Rumor has it... this is the old fleshly body of a Great Power from the Buddhist Realm. After being confiscated, it became a Vajra Sect outpost specializing in technological archaeology."

"It seems the Vajra Sect's predecessors used this place to study ancient techniques, adapting them into modern methods that greatly advanced the sect's Immortal Dao Technology."

"During the archaeological excavations, this site also became a laboratory for new technologies. Many mortals were hired to spread rumors about certain techniques to assist the archaeology and participate in experiments. Gradually, it transformed into a center for teaching Immortal Dao Technology."

"However, the Vajra Sect's Immortal Dao Technology has long since surpassed its predecessors. The sect's outpost here was eventually abandoned, and the site slowly evolved into Vajra University."

"Of course, it's said that archaeological work still continues here, though no major breakthroughs have surfaced."

Mo Shangjin speculated, "I suspect it's because the Vajra Sect's Immortal Dao Technology has far surpassed that of ancient Buddhism. These ancient methods no longer offer them any benefit."

As they spoke, the Flying Boat slowly descended into the massive palm of the Buddha Statue.

Looking at the outstretched palm, which was as vast as several airports combined, Zhang Yu couldn't help but marvel once more at the statue's colossal scale. The closer he got, the more awe-struck he became.

"Such an immense figure... How wealthy must this Great Power from the Buddhist Realm have been in life? What was their net worth?"

The moment the Flying Boat landed, the students from Myriad Laws University disembarked.

As Zhang Yu stepped off the vessel, a notification popped up in his Bionic Eye:

"Welcome to Vajra University! You are the 9,999th visitor today. Congratulations on becoming today's lucky visitor and winning a prize of 100 Spirit Coins! To claim your reward, please download..."

Neither Zhang Yu nor Shi Huaiyu, Su Yanyang, Xiao Yunji, or any of the others even glanced at the notification. They simply ignored it and silently entered Vajra University.

Upon entering the Buddha Statue, Zhang Yu found himself in a dazzling golden world. The entire sky and earth were bathed in a golden hue.

Skyscrapers rose before him like stacked mountain ranges, some standing upright, others hanging upside down, resembling the dense, organ-like structures within the statue's interior.

As Zhang Yu walked through this golden city, advertisements constantly popped up in his Bionic Eye. The moment his gaze lingered on one, he was immediately redirected to platforms like Vajra Profound Creation or Shedding Flesh Pavilion.

"Damn it, how does this dump have more ads than Myriad Laws?"

Zhang Yu felt like he'd stumbled into a filthy public toilet, forced to tiptoe carefully around piles of excrement.

Just as he was complaining, another notification popped up on his Bionic Eye: "Time-Worn Demonic Eye urgently needs an upgrade..."

"Is this for real?"

Recalling his experiences since arriving at Vajra University, Zhang Yu couldn't help but ask his classmates, "Have any of you received this Bionic Eye update notification?"

As everyone shook their heads, a Vajra University student nearby warned, "Don't click it! It's a malicious Spirit Realm trap. If you click, they'll steal your personal information."

Zhang Yu turned to the student, who immediately began explaining the common scams at Vajra University.

Listening to the student's well-intentioned advice, Zhang Yu couldn't help but think, "Is there actually a good person here?"

But when Zhang Yu accepted the student's friend request, he received a "Must-Read Guide for Vajra University Visitors."

When Zhang Yu clicked on the guide, he was redirected to a platform filled with questions like, "What part of your body are you most satisfied with?" and "Which body part would you most like to sell?" He immediately blocked the user.

"Register for a Vajra Profound Creation account now and receive a Profound Creation Relic!"

"Are you from Myriad Laws University? Sign up for a Shedding Flesh Pavilion account and get a Body-Selling Voucher!"

Throughout their journey, Zhang Yu and his group were constantly bombarded with registration invitations from Vajra University students. Most of these ads were recruitment campaigns for the Vajra Profound Creation and Shedding Flesh Pavilion platforms.

Zhang Yu suspected these offers were riddled with traps and didn't bother investigating further.

He also noticed that Vajra University students, regardless of gender, looked remarkably similar, especially their nearly identical physiques.

"Is this Vajra University's so-called standardized body refinement?"

After finally reaching a secluded spot, the hundred-armed Buddha statue beside them spoke: "Buying hands?"

Zhang Yu whirled around, startled. "Alive?"

Through the statue's explanation, Zhang Yu learned it was also a body refinement student from Vajra University.

He recalled Vajra University's so-called "master" artifact crafting.

After finally finding a place to rest, Zhang Yu and his group arrived at the competition arena.

They saw Chan Rong and his Vajra University team, their previous opponents, already waiting.

Zhang Yu slowly approached, his gaze clashing with Chan Rong's. A surge of battle intent gradually rose within him.

"Though we secured a practical victory last time, it wasn't satisfying enough."

"In this final showdown, I will utterly crush Vajra University."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Otherwise, what's the point of training the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power? How else will I achieve the comprehensive ranking required to transfer departments?"

As both teams stood their ground, Zhang Yu and Chan Rong locked eyes, their unspoken intentions colliding in the air.

After a long silence, Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "I didn't expect to meet again so soon."

Chan Rong replied calmly, "Nor did I anticipate the opportunity to personally eliminate Myriad Laws University."

"In that case, my previous defeat might have been a blessing in disguise."

He then asked, "Where's Mo Shangjin? Won't he participate in this final match?"

Zhang Yu scoffed. "I don't need Old Mo to deal with Vajra University. I can handle you myself."

Chan Rong replied, "Are you sure you're up to it? Wouldn't you want to increase your chances of winning before the match starts?"

"If you're so eager, you can visit the Shedding Flesh Pavilion, our second-hand fleshly body platform," Chan Rong said. "You can recycle any unused old Bionics or old fleshly bodies there. The Shedding Flesh Pavilion offers on-site verification, immediate payment..."

Zhang Yu snapped, "Damn it... you Vajra University guys never give up, do you?"

Chan Rong scoffed arrogantly. "The Immortal Dao's potential is like a river — if you don't advance, you'll fall behind. What's wrong with seizing every opportunity to improve yourself?"

"Even your Myriad Laws University's Principal would need to register an account to leave. Do you think you're special?"

Zhang Yu cursed, "What bullshit! Why don't you claim even Immortals need accounts to leave?"

"Don't believe me?" Chan Rong said. "Add me as a friend, and I'll send you screenshots."

Zhang Yu hesitated, tempted to accept the friend request. But Mo Shangjin's projection warned, "If you add him, he'll spam you with hundreds of ads a day, trying to get you to click."

Zhang Yu's eyes flickered, understanding Mo Shangjin's meaning. He spoke, "Friend slots cost 10 Spirit Coins each."

Chan Rong frowned slightly, remaining silent as if deep in thought.

Just as Zhang Yu thought he had a chance, Chan Rong shook his head and said, "You're not worth it."

Zhang Yu narrowed his eyes, his fighting spirit surging. "After we fight, the price will change."

Chan Rong nodded calmly. "You'll have to lower your price after you lose, won't you?"

As their fighting spirits intensified, the competition officially began, and both teams entered the arena in succession.

As they reached their respective construction sites...

3!

2!

1!

The competition officially commenced.

Chan Rong rose like a great sun, stepping into the void and radiating brilliant sunlight as he advanced step by step toward Zhang Yu.

"Zhang Yu, I knew before the competition that you mastered the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power this month."

"But I also know you only recently completed the Seven Absolutes of the Civil Engineering Department at Myriad Laws University... How strong could your foundation truly be?"

"Looking at you now reminds me of myself last year when I first obtained my Military Certificate, facing an opponent I couldn't possibly defeat."

"That's why I'll give you a chance to strike first..."
