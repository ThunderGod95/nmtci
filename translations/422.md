# Chapter 422: The Military Certificate Examination Begins

Inside the luxurious dormitory, Zhang Yu's hands moved with lightning speed, leaving a trail of afterimages as they swept across Le Mulan's body.

Le Mulan felt a strange magical power being injected into several of her meridians, temporarily severing her connection with her Bionic.

In addition to this, Zhang Yu occasionally channeled Blazing Sun Magic Power into her for cultivation purposes.

While practicing the Thirty-Six Paths of Primordial Magnetic Meridian Severing Hand, Zhang Yu was also using the opportunity to refine his own magic power alongside Le Mulan.

Regardless of the benefits Le Mulan received, Zhang Yu himself, despite having already maximized his magic power at the peak of Foundation Establishment, could still temper its resilience and quality through the clash between Blazing Sun and Profound Cold Magic Power. This process also helped elevate the grade of Le Mulan's Dao Seed.

Just then, the dormitory door opened, and Zhang Pianpian walked in.

"Senior Sister!" Zhang Yu turned to greet her, noting her ranking of 32nd in the Talisman Department. "Her ranking is steadily improving," he thought.

Zhang Pianpian smiled at Zhang Yu and said, "I'll be away for a while handling some matters. If you need anything, don't hesitate to contact me."

Meanwhile, Zhang Pianpian observed Zhang Yu poking and prodding Le Mulan, who occasionally frowned, furrowed her brow, and squirmed.

She sent him a message: "Zhang Yu, I've been watching you and Le Mulan for a while now."

Zhang Pianpian: "Do you want to engage in Dual Cultivation with her?"

Zhang Yu: "Senior Sister, what nonsense are you spouting? We're just focused on our cultivation!"

Zhang Pianpian: "Is that so?"

Zhang Pianpian: "But you've both been searching for countless questions and answers about Dual Cultivation!"

Zhang Pianpian: "And the frequency of those searches has been steadily increasing over the past few months!"

Zhang Yu: "It's just research! Is there something wrong with learning new things?"

Zhang Pianpian: "Then why are you looking up how people who transitioned from male to female can engage in Dual Cultivation?"

Zhang Yu: "Curiosity! I'm just curious, damn it!"

Zhang Yu: "My search history doesn't mean I intend to act on it."

Zhang Yu: "Otherwise, go check Yu Xinghan's records. His searches are far more outrageous than anything I've looked up."

Zhang Yu: "And... could you please pretend you haven't seen our search history?"

Zhang Pianpian: "Yu Xinghan? I haven't looked closely in a while. His searches are always so bizarre!"

Zhang Yu: "Send me a screenshot!"

Inside the dormitory:

Zhang Yu formed a hand seal, condensing his Magic Power into a stream of true qi within his body.

In the next instant, Zhang Yu pointed at the Earthly Fiend Bottle before him, and true qi surged forth, instantly scanning the bottle from top to bottom.

Immediately, detailed information and parameters about the Earthly Fiend Bottle materialized before his eyes.

Observing the displayed data, Zhang Yu mused inwardly, "This Treasure Appraisal Manual is truly remarkable. It seems to incorporate elements of talisman crafting and artifact forging!"

"Once activated, it can connect to the Spirit Realm to retrieve the latest data on magical artifacts. Even without a Spirit Realm Network connection, it can compile information stored in the Bionic Eye!"

"This will be perfect for coordinating with the Primordial Magnetic Meridian Severing Hand!"

Zhang Yu knew that his Primordial Magnetic Meridian Severing Hand technique required precise knowledge of a target Bionic's meridian interfaces to effectively seal it.

However, memorizing the meridian interfaces of every Bionic beforehand would be time-consuming, laborious, and ultimately impractical.

Therefore, scanning with the Treasure Appraisal Manual before executing the Primordial Magnetic Meridian Severing Hand became the most convenient solution.

As Zhang Yu diligently practiced the Treasure Appraisal Manual again and again, a communication window beside him showed Bai Zhenzhen practicing her sword techniques.

The two exchanged no words, no glances, simply focusing on their respective training and studies, as if this silent routine had become second nature.

Whenever Bai Zhenzhen stole a glance at Zhang Yu during her cultivation breaks, she felt as if he were right there beside her, and a faint smile would unconsciously grace her lips.

Just then, Wen Wuya's voice called from outside the door, "Zhenzhen, it's time to leave."

Bai Zhenzhen turned to Zhang Yu in the communication window and said, "Yu Zi, I have to go now!"

Zhang Yu nodded. "Okay."

At that moment, Le Mulan's voice chimed in from beside him, "Zhang Yu, open your mouth! My new medicine is coming!"

Zhang Yu opened his mouth and said, "A-Zhen, see you tomorrow night!"

Bai Zhenzhen smiled faintly. "Good luck with the Military Certificate Examination!"

Zhang Yu replied confidently, "Don't worry, I'll definitely pass."

The communication disconnected, and Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen resumed their separate lives.

In recent days, Su Yanyang had been tirelessly gathering intelligence on Ping Han.

In his eyes, Ping Han had become the biggest obstacle to obtaining the Military Certificate, the greatest threat to Su Yanyang's ambition.

"This guy... not only trades cryptocurrency himself, but he's also roped in a whole group of people?"

"Heh, a paid group for cryptocurrency trading tips?"

"This guy is doomed!"

Su Yanyang simply couldn't believe that Ping Han, a mere Civil Engineering Department worker, could possibly have mastered any real coin-trading skills. This was something even top Finance Department prodigies, those peerless geniuses who had mastered Qi Luck Dao Techniques, struggled to comprehend!

In Su Yanyang's eyes, Ping Han had simply gotten lucky and struck it rich.

"The best move now would be to cash out gracefully, take those 400-plus Spirit Coins, and never trade coins again!"

If Su Yanyang were in Ping Han's shoes, that's exactly what he would do.

But he also understood that not everyone possessed his decisiveness and courage.

"Ping Han is trading Jade Nectar Coins, and he's using leverage ratios of 10x or even 20x!"

Su Yanyang had spent time studying the Jade Nectar Coin's market history over the past few years. He knew its price fluctuations were unpredictable and terrifying, with massive swings in short periods. Every year, countless traders were wiped out by this volatile coin.

"With Ping Han's skill level, he won't last long!"

"He'll almost certainly blow up his account before the Military Certificate Examination even begins!"

Having reached this conclusion, Su Yanyang decided to mortgage his Bionic to further enhance his competitiveness in the upcoming Military Certificate Examination.

As the Military Certificate Examination drew closer, Su Yanyang was astonished to discover that Ping Han hadn't lost a single coin. In fact, with the Jade Nectar Coin's meteoric rise, Ping Han was earning more than ever!

"How is this possible?"

Watching Ping Han's daily profit reports, Su Yanyang cycled through shock, anger, and regret, ultimately settling into helpless resignation.

Seeing Ping Han make so much money was more agonizing than being stabbed. Even when Su Yanyang had lost to Zhang Yu before, he hadn't felt this tormented.

Without realizing it, Ping Han had become the person Su Yanyang loathed most in the world.

In the medical bay, Xiao Yunji lay surrounded by medicine bottles, massive doses of potions coursing through her veins to maintain her Bionic synchronization rate.

"Just a few more days!"

"The Military Certificate Examination will be over soon!"

Xiao Yunji hailed from the eighth layer of Kunxu, a descendant of a powerful executive in a construction conglomerate, carrying his inherited bloodline. She and her siblings had been bred primarily to extend their ancestor's lifespan.

For many wealthy individuals in Kunxu's seventh to tenth layers, wasting resources on nurturing descendants during the peak of their Immortal Dao cultivation was considered unnecessary. But as their potential waned and further advancement became difficult, it was time to produce offspring and cultivate the next generation.

Especially as one's lifespan dwindles, the cost of maintaining oneself skyrockets, requiring more descendants to earn money, provide support, and even offer blood-related physical bodies!

Xiao Yunji had witnessed wealthy individuals who ultimately fell into the Spirit Realm, draining every drop of blood from their descendants and dragging their entire families to ruin.

Fortunately, her family's Ancestor hadn't reached that point yet.

Nevertheless, Xiao Yunji remained determined to secure the Military Certificate. Only by obtaining it could she continue to receive investments, climb higher, and avoid working for a construction company where the majority of her earnings would be surrendered to the family, prematurely draining every drop of her blood to prolong the Ancestor's life.

Feeling the cutting-edge Transformation Dharma Armor enveloping her body and the cultivation she had painstakingly honed, a confident smile spread across Xiao Yunji's face.

"This Transformation Dharma Armor is specifically designed for combat. By shifting beyond human form, it can unleash combat power far beyond what a human body could ever achieve!"

"Last year's Civil Engineering Competition was merely a warm-up!"

"Now, combined with the Cultivation Art I've specially trained in, the synergy will far exceed the sum of its parts!"

"And don't forget the six magical artifacts I borrowed through endorsement deals!"

"This time... I'm definitely getting that Military Certificate."

Just then, Xiao Yunji frowned. Ping Han had sent another message!

"That guy..."

Xiao Yunji really wanted to block him!

But she ultimately didn't. After all, he was her biggest rival in the upcoming Military Certificate Examination, and she desperately wanted to gather intelligence on him.

Watching his frequent screenshots of profits, Xiao Yunji grew increasingly serious.

"Another win?"

His constantly growing bank balance felt like watching his combat power steadily increase, making Ping Han seem like an ever-greater threat.

October!

Unknowingly, the day of the Military Certificate Examination had arrived.

In his dormitory, Zhang Yu opened his eyes, a slight nervousness creeping into his heart. "It's finally starting!"

Before leaving, Le Mulan held up a finger. "Take this specially formulated medicine I prepared for you before you go!"

Yu Xinghan offered, "Let me help you relax and warm up first."

As Zhang Yu walked through the Primordial Magnetic Channel, he read Bai Zhenzhen's message:

Bai Zhenzhen: "Yu Zi, good luck! I believe in you."

Zhang Pianpian: "Winning is fine, but don't get too cocky!"

Zhao Tianxing: "Nervous ⊙﹏⊙"

Director Gao: "Do what you can. I'll be watching from the stands!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "It's just the Civil Engineering Department's Military Certificate. It's not the end of the world if you don't pass. Remember, the most important thing is to protect your physical body!"

As messages floated across his Bionic Eye, Zhang Yu felt as if countless hands were gently pressing against his back, nudging him forward step by step until he reached the examination hall.
