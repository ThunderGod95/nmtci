# Chapter 50: Changes and Upping the Ante

_With only six moves, this Limitless Cloud Hand is so quick to practice. Couldn't I get it to level 10 tonight?_

But after Zhang Yu rallied his spirits and practiced another five times, he felt the magic power within him growing increasingly thin, no longer enough to support his cultivation of the Limitless Cloud Hand.

Zhang Yu realized his earlier thinking was flawed.

_It seems there's no way to get this Limitless Cloud Hand to level 10 in one night._

Unlike a foundational cultivation technique such as Freehand Combat, the Limitless Cloud Hand consumed far more magic power.

Even with the passive breathing exercise of the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method constantly restoring his magic power, it was impossible for him to practice for hours on end as he did with Freehand Combat.

So, Zhang Yu simply sat cross-legged, allowing the passive breathing exercise to continue recovering his magic power while he also practiced the Desolate Ox Soul-Suppressing Mantra to enhance his Dao heart.

By practicing in such fits and starts, when the night was over, Zhang Yu had raised his Limitless Cloud Hand to level 6 (7/60).

The coverage of his Formless Cloud-Astral Qi had now extended from his hands all the way to his arms and shoulders, surging ceaselessly like a rolling sea of clouds.

The original phenomenon—of a cloud of mist rocketing upward like a column of wolf smoke—had also vanished.

Now, only the faintest wisps of vapor could be seen slowly drifting a dozen centimeters upward before dissipating into the air.

This was because as his control increased, the consumption of astral qi during his circulation of the Formless Cloud-Astral Qi was drastically reduced.

...

The next day, at Songyang High School.

Inside the student council office.

Zhou Chechen looked at the message on his phone and smiled faintly.

"He actually took fourth place in the Magic Power Competition? That's a bit unexpected."

Lan Ling, lifting a dumbbell, said, "I heard White Dragon High School's competition coach spoke to him, wanted to poach him."

Zhou Chechen chuckled. "They had a competition spot snatched away this time, which means one less achievement on a student's resume. Of course they want to recruit him."

"What do you think? If we sign Zhang Yu and specifically train him for Magic Power Competitions, could we snatch a few more top spots? And let the students from the three great schools win a few less awards?"

For the wealthy families of Songyang City, the number of spots at the Ten Greats' top universities was limited; every award missing from someone else's resume increased their own child's chances of success.

Lan Ling stated sullenly, "He might have a chance in his first year, but starting from the second, I don't think Zhang Yu can beat them."

Zhou Chechen said cheerfully, "Even so, that's not bad."

"Then it's decided."

"We can't let White Dragon High School actually poach him."

"After this month's exams end..."

Zhou Chechen looked at his hand as he slowly closed it into a fist, as if tightly gripping everything he desired within his palm.

"Zhang Yu must sign the contract."

Lan Ling understood the meaning behind those words: after the monthly exams, Zhang Yu would have no choice but to sign.

...

Outside the school gates, Zhao Tianxing spoke into his phone, "I know, Mom, I know..."

A woman's voice came from the phone: "Spend more time with Zhang Yu. Look how quickly his grades are improving..."

"I know, I know." After a few perfunctory replies, Zhao Tianxing finally hung up.

Just as he walked through the school entrance, he saw the line of large text scrolling across the electronic screen again: A warm congratulations to our school's first-year, class (1) student, Zhang Yu, for winning 4th place in the city-wide Magic Power Competition, high school division.

_So it's true..._

Although he had already heard related rumors in several school group chats yesterday, only now, upon seeing the words for himself, did Zhao Tianxing confirm that it was real.

The thought that Zhang Yu, who just recently was eating at the same table as him, had suddenly surpassed a crowd of top students from the three great schools and other key high schools to take fourth in the Magic Power Competition made Zhao Tianxing’s heart clench.

A wave of shame followed.

_Zhao Tianxing, oh, Zhao Tianxing, how can you be so jealous when a classmate achieves such great results? It's hideous! Where did your moral character go?_

_Sigh, I can't compare myself to Zhang Yu. He's a Golden Core disciple, after all. We're not even the same species anymore._

_He must have won fourth place in the competition because that True Monarch Starfire put in a great deal of effort._

_And Mom still tells me to hang out with him more..._

Zhao Tianxing gave a bitter smile internally.

_With such a huge gap between us, can we even hang out together?_

The rumor of Zhang Yu being a Golden Core disciple was further solidified among the students because of his fourth-place finish in the competition.

And as someone who tended to overthink what others thought, Zhao Tianxing felt a sense of inferiority just thinking about the dazzling halo surrounding Zhang Yu now.

_He's a Golden Core disciple, and the gap between our scores is only getting wider. Does he already look down on me? In his eyes, I'm probably just another average student on the side of the road._

_If I deliberately try to get close to him now, to hang out with him... won't that look too sycophantic to others? Will they think I'm a vain social climber? That I want to bask in his Golden Core disciple glory?_

You couldn't blame Zhao Tianxing for overthinking; as a teenager who grew up in the city, he had seen too many similar situations at school.

Once a gap in scores appeared between friends, the friendship would always gradually change.

Things like, "You've changed ever since your score got higher." Or, "Your score is so low, I feel embarrassed being seen with you." And even, "I'll help you raise your score by 10 points, but don't ever look for me again after that..."

_Sigh, if Zhang Yu doesn't ask me to lunch today, I'd better not go find him myself, just to avoid being rejected._

When the bell rang for the end of the last class of the morning, Zhao Tianxing intentionally or unintentionally glanced in Zhang Yu's direction.

Seeing Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen chatting, he felt a pang of envy. If only his grades were as good as Bai Zhenzhen's, then he could also chat and laugh with Zhang Yu.

Seeing Zhang Yu then talking with Zhou Tianyi, he grew envious of Zhou Tianyi. His score was even lower than his own, yet he could still talk freely with Zhang Yu without any awkwardness. He never had that kind of easy confidence.

Just then, Zhao Tianxing noticed the three of them stand up and walk in his direction.

Zhao Tianxing quickly lowered his head, and as he sensed the three of them getting closer, he pretended to organize his desk, moving a few books back and forth as if he couldn't get them right, completely ignoring their approach.

But in his mind, he was keenly focused on their movements, with one question revolving in his head.

_Will he ask me to eat with them?_

Zhang Yu said, "Old Zhao! Let's go get lunch together."

Zhao Tianxing quickly stood up and smiled. "Yeah, let's go."

They walked on the path to the cafeteria.

Zhou Tianyi said with a smile, "Zhang Yu, have you noticed that the atmosphere in the school feels a little different today?"

"Has it?" Zhang Yu thought for a moment and said, "The teachers are still as gentle, the students are still as friendly, and the air is still filled with the scent of learning. It's all good."

Zhou Tianyi said, "You got fourth place in the competition. Now most of the school believes you must be a Golden Core disciple. Haven't you noticed everyone treating you with more respect?"

Zhang Yu reflected for a moment, and it did seem like his classmates' attitudes toward him had indeed... gained a subtle sense of distance.

Bai Zhenzhen, who was beside them, said coolly, "Yes, I heard people talking about you in the girls' restroom. They were all saying you must have been boosted up by a Golden Core True Monarch, that it's all about connections and good luck."

Zhou Tianyi added, "I heard people in the boys' restroom saying you must have cracked the code to wooing a rich older woman. Otherwise, how could ordinary people like them not even know where the art exhibition for selecting Golden Core disciples was held, let alone attend and be chosen..."

Zhang Yu sighed. "Alas, to think that my hard-won glory for the school has only earned me distance and jealousy."

Zhou Tianyi smiled. "Zhang Yu, the higher your score, the better your achievements, the more jealousy you'll naturally attract."

He said slowly, "They won't think about your hard work or your talent. They'll only assume you have better circumstances and attribute all your success to your luck."

Looking at Zhou Tianyi's contemplative expression, Zhang Yu said thoughtfully, "I didn't expect you, ranked 25th in the year... to know so much."

Zhou Tianyi stumbled, retorting irritably, "Hey... there are over five hundred students in our grade. A 25th-place ranking is still standing on the heads of many people."

Watching Zhang Yu joking and laughing, Zhao Tianxing, who was walking alongside them, gradually began to relax.

_I can't believe Zhang Yu is still so approachable after getting fourth in the competition._

But a moment later, Zhao Tianxing changed his mind; Zhang Yu had changed, at least a little.

At the food counter, Zhang Yu looked at the cafeteria lady and said, "Ma'am, I got fourth place in the city-wide Magic Power Competition. Could you give me a little extra meat?"

The cafeteria lady replied, "You got it! This biggest piece of pork rib is for our city-wide Magic Power Competition's fourth-place winner."

Songyang High School had a strong academic atmosphere; of course, even the cafeteria ladies judged a person by their score first.

...

That night.

A suburb of Songyang City.

With a series of whooshing sounds, a black shadow flickered at high speed through the night sky, continuously approaching Zhang Yu's rented apartment.

Bang!

After a brief pause at the main entrance of the apartment building, the door opened and the black shadow shot inside like a wisp of green smoke. In the blink of an eye, it had already reached Zhang Yu's floor, finally appearing ghost-like before his door.

A knocking sound, _dong dong dong_, echoed.

Zhang Yu quickly stood up to open the door.

He saw a middle-aged man with the stride of a dragon and the stance of a tiger, whose presence was as deep as an abyss and as imposing as a mountain, standing at his door and looking at him.

"Are you Mr. Zhang Yu?"

Zhang Yu nodded and said, "Swift-Arrival Delivery? It's only been about twenty minutes. You guys are fast."

The middle-aged man smiled, pulled the item out of the large backpack he was carrying, and presented it to Zhang Yu.

"Mr. Zhang, this is the item you ordered. Please sign for it."

A moment later, Zhang Yu closed the door again and took out the things he had purchased.

Through the Magic Power Competition, Zhang Yu had come to recognize the gap between himself and the top students from the famous schools, which made him even more eager to improve himself.

In his current situation, his magic power was cultivated day and night by the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method, and his Dao heart was his main focus for improvement every day. Only his physical strength had been neglected and had temporarily stagnated.

Thinking about the martial arts competition next month, where he would likely have to face off against the rich kids from the famous schools again, Zhang Yu felt an increasing need to enhance his physical strength.

So, after some careful calculation, he had purchased a few things online.
