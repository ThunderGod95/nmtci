# Chapter 676: Lunar War 1

Standing on the Kunxu Second Layer, one could gaze upward and see the heavens pierced by some immense force, allowing glimpses of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Layers to shimmer across the sky.

However, the Fifth Layer was now sealed behind a black Heavenly Veil, obscuring its details.

As the radiant flames emanating from the Kunxu Fourth Layer gradually extinguished, a dark Heavenly Veil slowly spread across it, sealing it off.

With the defeats on the Fourth and Fifth Layers, nearly half the sky above the Kunxu Second Layer was now shrouded in impenetrable darkness, resembling a bottomless abyss slowly consuming the entire Second Layer.

Meanwhile, the Kunxu Third Layer began to flicker with light, revealing glimpses of powerful cultivators engaged in fierce magical combat.

Watching all this, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "This must be why Master is emerging from seclusion. We can't delay any longer."

"If we wait any longer, most of the Second Layer's inhabitants will likely surrender without a fight."

Gazing at the encroaching darkness of the Heavenly Veil overhead, Zhang Yu could imagine the panic gripping countless hearts on Kunxu's Second Layer, while others cheered with wild abandon.

He suspected the Heavenly Court had anticipated this, which was why all Soul Transformation Certificates had been issued on the Second Layer.

"Moreover, the Ten Greats League likely served to draw the true forms of the various universities' elite to the Second Layer," Zhang Yu mused.

Having only recently enrolled, Zhang Yu already knew that the Second through Sixth Layers comprised Kunxu's University District, each with distinct functions. Nascent Soul True Monarchs from each university often possessed multiple Incarnations, allowing them to simultaneously operate across these layers, navigating the Spirit Realm through their Incarnations for efficiency.

Lady Fortune analyzed, "With the Nascent Soul True Monarchs leading the sweeps, the Second Layer's rebel forces, though still offering sporadic resistance, no longer pose a significant threat."

"However, as long as that crimson moon hangs in the sky, it will drastically increase governance costs, logistics expenses, and operational burdens. The Second Layer's universities' economies cannot recover until it's gone."

Lady Fortune sighed. "Eight months is definitely not enough time for Soul Transformation cultivators to reach their peak state, but delaying further would only complicate matters."

"Therefore, Magnetic Pole plans to conquer the Moon. This serves a dual purpose: to boost morale and stabilize public sentiment, and to revitalize the economy, thereby accelerating the cultivation efficiency of Soul Transformation cultivators."

Zhang Yu remarked, "The Righteous Qi Alliance must be aware of this strategy. I doubt the Moon will be an easy target."

Lady Fortune replied, "Easy or not, we have no choice but to strike. Given the gravity of this operation, it's certain that Myriad Laws won't be acting alone."

Soon, various announcements and news from the Spirit Realm confirmed Lady Fortune and Zhang Yu's predictions.

First, the Ten Great Universities announced a strategic alliance, led by Myriad Laws, to jointly participate in the Lunar War.

Next, to prepare for the war, the universities began issuing war bonds and requisitioning various war materials. As civilian supplies of medicine, food, magical artifacts, Bionics, and other resources dwindled, prices skyrocketed once again.

Zhang Yu felt that the Ten Great Universities now resembled a muscular man, firmly planted on the ground, clenching his fists, twisting his torso, and frantically gathering strength.

The process of accumulating power was so obvious that it couldn't possibly be concealed from anyone.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "The Righteous Qi Alliance has infiltrated almost all of the Ten Great Universities to varying degrees. With such a massive operation, they probably figured that since they couldn't hide it, they might as well launch a full-scale assault."

Just then, Principal Gao's avatar appeared in Zhang Yu's bionic eye.

Zhang Yu answered the call, saying, "Master."

Principal Gao's projection materialized before Zhang Yu. Looking up at the darkening sky, he sighed, "You're observing the celestial situation from the top floor as well?"

Zhang Yu nodded. "Yes, I heard about what happened on the fourth layer and decided to come take a look."

After a pause, Zhang Yu asked, "Master, will you be participating in this battle?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood gazed toward the horizon, where the moon was rising, and said slowly, "This battle concerns not only the Myriad Laws, but also the very survival of Kunxu's Second Layer."

"If we win, we still have a chance."

"If we lose, countless souls will fall into the embrace of the Evil Gods. When the Heavenly Court descends, Kunxu's Second to Fifth Layers will likely face annihilation, with fewer than one in ten thousand surviving."

Zhang Yu opened his mouth, his heart brimming with a thousand words, yet he couldn't find the right ones. Finally, he whispered, "Master, be careful in this battle."

Divine Monarch Greenwood clasped his hands behind his back, his voice carrying the weight of endless ages. "I was originally just a Nascent Soul cultivator, swept along by the tides of destiny to this position."

"This position is both infinitely glorious and infinitely perilous. It grants the greatest wealth but also forces one to confront the strongest, fiercest, and most malevolent adversaries."

"But since I have already achieved Soul Transformation, consumed the resources for it, and burned through countless assets, I must now bear the responsibilities of a Soul Transformation cultivator."

"The Long Night Jade Palace is a Myriad Laws Treasure. Your Master and I participated in its construction long ago. We have no choice but to reclaim it."

"In this battle, Magnetic Pole and I have no room to retreat or evade."

"But if we fail..."

Sensing the Divine Monarch Greenwood's unwavering resolve and fighting spirit, Zhang Yu felt a pang of alarm.

Divine Monarch Greenwood turned to Zhang Yu. "Take your people and hide."

"Leave University City and seek refuge deep underground."

"Stay hidden until the Heavenly Court descends."

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's Bionic Eye displayed a wealth of intelligence about the Moon.

Although she had been in secluded cultivation for the past eight months, her Incarnation on the second layer had been actively gathering information.

Collecting data on the Moon, the layered blockades, and spatial anomalies had been a key objective of these operations.

"Layers 2 through 5 are completely sealed off. This sealing is due to a fundamental alteration in the spatial structure."

Unbeknownst to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, as Zhang Yu advanced Kunlun in the Palm to Level 30, her Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology had absorbed significant knowledge related to Spatial Technology.

She merely perceived that since witnessing Dao Qiankun's martial arts, observing Zhang Yu's Kunlun in the Palm on the award podium, and studying the spatial blockades between layers 2 and 3, her understanding of Spatial Technology had deepened considerably.

"The alteration in spatial structure has completely sealed off layers 2 through 3, making passage impossible for us."

"Moreover, this spatial blockade has now extended to the Moon itself."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole gazed at the massive data streams before her, thinking to herself, "Through the probing attacks over the past six months, the outer spatial structure of the Long Night Jade Palace has been completely altered..."

She analyzed mentally, "The entire Moon has been protected by a spatial blockade, with only a single gap left open for communication with the Spirit Realm."

"But even if we launch an attack through this gap, we can only tear open an entrance large enough for two Soul Transformation cultivators to pass through at most."

"And if the enemy simply blocks this entrance..."

As she pondered this scenario, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole felt as if she were witnessing an ancient battlefield's mountain pass. The Soul Transformation experts guarding the Moon were like a single warrior blocking the way, impenetrable to ten thousand foes.

"With such a strategic advantage, the enemy only needs to withstand the combined might of two Soul Transformation cultivators to hold the Moon."

"But if the battle drags on too long..."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's mind flashed to the situations on the third, fourth, and fifth layers. "The main forces from the upper layers might eventually reinforce them."

She knew that the inter-layer blockades would prevent Soul Transformation cultivators from the Ten Great Universities from providing cross-layer support, but they wouldn't hinder the Rebel Army's movements. This was precisely why Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, despite not being at her peak cultivation state, had no choice but to engage in this battle.

"If the Rebel Army manages to consolidate Layers 3 through 5 while we haven't reclaimed the Moon on Layer 2, I fear this calamity... the entire Ten Greats will face grave danger..."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole continued organizing intelligence and finalizing the battle plan. "In addition to that, there's the issue of communication within the Spirit Realm."

"Besides that fellow on the Moon, there's at least one other Evil God present."

"We must maintain seamless communication within the Spirit Realm..."

As Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole pondered, the battle plan continued to refine itself.

Simultaneously, massive amounts of information surged back and forth between the Soul Transformation cultivators of the Ten Great Universities. Countless resources began to mobilize, and Nascent Soul True Monarchs swept across the land, stabilizing the situation and setting the stage for a series of earth-shattering battles.

Three days later, the day the Lunar War began.

A blood-red Moon hung in the sky, casting its crimson light across the Kunxu Second Layer, just as it had every night for the past eight months.

Streams of divine light, carrying earth-shattering momentum, erupted from the campuses of the Ten Great Universities, soaring toward the Moon.

Simultaneously, Nascent Soul True Monarchs mobilized, sealing off a thousand-kilometer radius around the Long Night Jade Palace as the battlefield, prohibiting all entry and exit.

Zhang Yu watched the heaven-piercing divine lights streak across the night sky like celestial pillars, plunging into the depths of the Kunxu Third Layer as if to prop it up.

He understood this wasn't literal support but a precaution by the Soul Transformation cultivators against reinforcements from the upper layers. It was also meant to defend and monitor critical locations in the Second Layer, such as the Sun Magical Artifact, the Sun-Patrolling Golden Crow.

All this was to ensure the upcoming Lunar War would proceed undisturbed.

Thus, surrounded by divine light and under the gaze of countless eyes, the true Lunar War was about to begin.

Zhang Yu watched the two streams of divine light, one black and one green, descend toward the Moon, knowing his two Masters had entered the battlefield.

As the divine light collided with the Moon, visible ripples erupted across its surface.

The two streams of light pierced the Moon like swords, inching deeper into its core.

Above the colossal magical artifact known as the Long Night Jade Palace, a figure gradually materialized.

"Chain Nexus..." True Monarch Magnetic Pole said coldly, gazing at the figure emerging on the Moon. "It was you all along."

True Monarch Chain Nexus... No, now Divine Monarch Chain Nexus. He had once been the Director of the Finance Department at Myriad Laws University, a disciple of Divine Monarch Golden Citadel of the Finance Department, and had even invited Zhang Yu to join the department.

Now standing on the Moon, he faced the two approaching Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs and said calmly, "Magnetic Pole, Greenwood, I have been waiting for you both for a long time."

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus spoke with an air of compassion, "Since this battle began with Myriad Laws, let it end with Myriad Laws as well."
