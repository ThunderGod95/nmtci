# Chapter 483: Under the Spotlight

Within the Civil Engineering Department's faculty group chat:

Tu Lishan: Congratulations to the Competition Team for their victory over Heavenly Sword University! [fireworks][fireworks][fireworks]

Tu Lishan: Director Gao, I've uploaded the competition video.

Instantly, the faculty group chat flooded with congratulatory messages, and virtual fireworks erupted across the screen.

Director Gao nodded slightly, deeply satisfied with the Competition Team's performance.

"One more win, and they'll be the Losers' Bracket champions, advancing to the finals."

"Why aren't the Peace Faction members congratulating them?"

Frowning as he scanned the teachers' names, Director Gao felt a strong urge to summon Director Lin himself.

He recalled the Peace Faction's criticism of Zhang Yu's team for securing the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering too quickly, claiming it deviated from proper procedure. The memory only intensified Director Gao's desire to force them to witness the Competition Team's achievements.

Yet he hesitated, realizing such a move might be inappropriate.

"I'll just have Tu Lishan handle it..."

Meanwhile, Mo Shangjin sent him a message: Teacher, I didn't expect Zhang Yu to win the match without me even needing to compete.

Director Gao: "It seems letting him master the Seven Absolutes early wasn't a waste after all."

Mo Shangjin: "But there's something I need to tell you."

As Director Gao listened to the news of Zhang Yu's breakthrough on the field, his brow gradually furrowed. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly, sensing that Zhang Yu had unknowingly been drawn into a brewing storm.

"That Yin Artifact... it could very well be Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Soul Transformation Yin Artifact."

"For someone at the Foundation Establishment stage to be entangled with a Soul Transformation Yin Artifact... his future may no longer be his own."

With this thought, the image of True Monarch Magnetic Pole flashed through Director Gao's mind. He immediately sent her a message to inquire.

Director Gao: "Have you heard about Zhang Yu's situation?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Don't worry, I'll protect your disciple. Your investment won't go to waste."

Director Gao's heart jolted at her reply. He quickly responded: "Magnetic Pole, you must be careful yourself."

Director Gao: "This matter is not simple."

Director Gao: "They're giving you this opportunity to use you as a shield."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Haha, Old Gao, in Kunxu, there's no opportunity, no matter the risk."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "I've yearned for the glory of Soul Transformation for far too long."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Instead of worrying about me, you should focus on your disciple."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: [Photo]

Director Gao opened the photo True Monarch Magnetic Pole sent and saw Zhang Yu standing with Bai Zhenzhen and Wen Wuya.

Director Gao paused slightly. "What's this?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole briefly introduced the two. "Wen Wuya is fine, but Bai Zhenzhen carries immense risks."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "You've heard something about the Seven Emotions lineage, haven't you?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Though I've already warned Zhang Yu on the Flying Boat, he still seems reluctant to give up."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "After he returns, give him a proper scolding. Make him sever all ties with Bai Zhenzhen completely — ideally, block her immediately."

---

On the Flying Boat, after True Monarch Magnetic Pole disconnected the communication, she patted Zhang Yu's head and smiled. "Once we disembark, someone will take you to the Laboratory."

"I'll be waiting for you there. We'll give you a thorough examination then."

Watching her figure disappear, Zhang Yu finally let out a small sigh of relief, thinking that True Monarch Magnetic Pole hadn't detected anything unusual about him.

However, fearing she might have left behind some surveillance, he resisted the urge to immediately switch back to the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo, despite his burning curiosity.

As soon as Zhang Yu returned to Myriad Laws University, True Monarch Celestial Seal escorted him to the Laboratory.

Watching the two figures hurry away, Su Yanyang, Xiao Yunji, and the others couldn't help but feel a pang of envy.

After all, who wouldn't want to improve their Cultivation Art and earn money just by participating in experiments?

Realizing they still had to work overtime to earn money for cultivation, loan repayments, and other expenses, Shi Huaiyu and the others sighed and hurried off in their respective directions.

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu walked alongside True Monarch Celestial Seal, the latter kept repeating, "The university leaders are extremely interested in the results of this project. They're very satisfied with the progress our team has made."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "What results are you even talking about?"

True Monarch Celestial Seal continued, "I heard about the incident at Heavenly Sword University. It was far too dangerous. Avoid getting entangled with the Seven Emotions lineage in the future — they're nothing but trouble."

He warned, "Remember, your body is no longer just your own. It's crucial to the entire project team and the future prospects of countless others. We can't afford to underestimate the security risks."

"I advise you to avoid participating in any off-campus competitions from now on. Try to stay within the university grounds as much as possible."

Zhang Yu naturally couldn't agree to this. Civil Engineering competitions directly impacted his overall grades and ranking, while off-campus projects were essential for his income. How could he possibly give them up?

Sensing Zhang Yu's reluctance, True Monarch Celestial Seal smiled but said nothing, planning to have Zhang Yu's teacher persuade him later.

As they spoke, the two had already arrived at the laboratory.

Upon entering, Zhang Yu was immediately taken for various tests, particularly to assess the power of his Level 18 Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

After confirming that Zhang Yu's Cultivation Art level had indeed reached 18, True Monarch Celestial Seal couldn't help but burst into laughter.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Magnetic Pole had arrived at the laboratory and immediately began conducting further tests on Zhang Yu.

She was deeply curious about the mysteries of the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact and its enhancement of Zhang Yu's Cultivation Art.

"Using Dual Cultivation to advance Cultivation Art levels is a unique technique of Joyful Union University. If I can unravel its secrets, achieving Soul Transformation will be within my grasp."

With that, True Monarch Magnetic Pole firmly gripped Zhang Yu and began carefully, yet with a hint of excitement, collecting samples from his body.

Hair, blood, Magic Power... she needed ample material for her upcoming experiments.

On the other side, True Monarch Celestial Seal snapped a blurry photo of Zhang Yu being studied and posted it on his social media account with the caption: "This will be a world-altering invention, a groundbreaking technology of epochal significance."

Watching the likes and comments surge, True Monarch Celestial Seal smiled faintly.

At that moment, his gaze shifted as he received a series of messages through his Bionic Eye, indicating visitors had arrived at the laboratory.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Magnetic Pole, having finished her tasks, turned to Zhang Yu and said, "Your assignment for today is complete. You may leave now."

"However, you must be available to assist whenever needed."

"Your contract will be upgraded. The details are still being finalized, but I'll ensure you receive higher compensation. I'll discuss it with you later."

Just as True Monarch Magnetic Pole dismissed Zhang Yu, True Monarch Celestial Seal appeared outside the laboratory with a group of people.

One of them remarked, "Is it wise to let the test subject leave like this?"

Observing their figures, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's gaze narrowed slightly. "The Research Department types, are they?" she thought.

The Research Department was the authoritative body overseeing all Immortal Dao research projects at Myriad Laws University.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole recognized the man before her as Feng Yuhuan, a supervisor in the Research Department who happened to be in charge of the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact project.

Sensing Feng Yuhuan's warning, Zhang Yu unconsciously stopped walking and glanced back at True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "If I told you to leave, then leave. Don't linger here."

This time, Zhang Yu stepped away without further hesitation. Feng Yuhuan didn't stop him, but shook his head and sighed, "You're just letting him go like that? What if something happens?"

"The experimental results on his body are a crucial asset of the university."

"Do you realize he might already be targeted by other universities, especially Joyful Union University?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied calmly, "Don't you have university assets on you? Don't I? If even Myriad Laws University isn't safe, we might as well all stay locked in our caves forever."

"You know that's not what I meant," Feng Yuhuan frowned. "These experimental subjects should be strictly managed. I heard he's still competing in tournaments and working on projects outside? I suggest you keep him in the laboratory and prevent him from wandering around."

"What if he's attacked by people from other universities while he's out there?"

"And why did you apply for a contract with a base salary of 40 Spirit Coins per month? That's outrageous! He's just being studied, not actually involved in technical development. There's no need to pay him so much."

"The school's funding is meant for proper use, not reckless spending."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole ignored him, turning and walking back into the laboratory. "I have my own plans. If there are any issues, I'll report them to Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations. It's none of your concern."

As the laboratory door sealed shut, True Monarch Celestial Seal chuckled helplessly. "That's just how True Monarch Magnetic Pole is. She's so immersed in her research that she can be a bit eccentric at times."

Feng Yuhuan snorted coldly. "This isn't about eccentricity. It's about wasting school funds and resources, and jeopardizing the school's assets."

"I'll report this situation to the higher-ups in detail. Even if it's Magnetic Pole, I won't let her run wild."

Watching Feng Yuhuan storm off, True Monarch Celestial Seal shook his head in resignation.

Just then, a voice called out, "True Monarch Celestial Seal, shall we continue the tour?"

True Monarch Celestial Seal turned toward the source of the voice, his gaze landing on Nine Heavens Liu from the Finance Department.

Though still a student, True Monarch Celestial Seal didn't underestimate him. Beyond his Finance Department affiliation, Nine Heavens Liu was backed by his Soul Transformation Master, Divine Monarch Golden Citadel.

While True Monarch Celestial Seal respected all three Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs at the academy, he held particular reverence for Divine Monarch Golden Citadel.

He knew that this Divine Monarch, with his background in finance, wielded immense influence over the allocation of the academy's funds and investments.

Moreover, the Divine Monarch oversaw countless companies and vast assets. Even a sliver of his resources could propel an entire project to flourish.

The current Soul Transformation Yin Artifact Experiment, for instance, had received partial funding from the Divine Monarch's investments.

Nine Heavens Liu's visit was a preliminary assessment to gauge the potential for future funding increases.

True Monarch Celestial Seal smiled faintly. "Ah, yes, yes, let's continue the tour."

Nine Heavens Liu asked, "Could I see the Yin Artifact?"

He smiled. "I'd like to personally test its effects."
