# Chapter 395: The Joy of Victory

Inside the Primordial Magnetic Channel, Gongshu Jin sped forward, scrolling through the information he received via his Bionic Eye.

The moment he achieved his breakthrough, Gongshu Jin immediately posted on his social media about securing seventh place in the Civil Engineering Competition and gaining the right to use the Profound Yellow Mountain-Suppressing Seal.

To Gongshu Jin, this was only natural. Progress should be flaunted aggressively; otherwise, how would his credit limit increase? How would family bonds deepen? How would familial affection endure? How would friendships be maintained?

His post immediately triggered a flood of comments.

There were congratulations, requests for details, offers of emergency funds, and a barrage of promotions from vendors selling medicine, daoist arts services, and various Immortal Dao products.

Even some fellow Fourth Layer natives residing on the Second Layer sent him inquiries.

Although Gongshu Jin had joined some Hometown Groups for Fourth Layer natives on the Second Layer and befriended some Fourth Layer natives, his position within the Civil Engineering Department — lacking an Overall Department Ranking and not even being the top student in his class — meant he remained largely unnoticed by most Fourth Layer natives.

The rare attention from Fourth Layer natives filled Gongshu Jin with elation.

Just then, another message arrived.

Ji Yuanshu: "Gongshu Jin, hello."

Gongshu Jin thought to himself, "Hmm? Isn't that Ji Yuanshu, the former top student who's now fifth in our class?"

As the competition's overall scores were tallied, the already tight class rankings underwent a dramatic shift.

Gongshu Jin, Ying Xin, and Yu Xinghan, previously ranked third, fourth, and fifth respectively, each advanced one position, pushing Ji Yuanshu down to fifth place.

Every time Gongshu Jin thought about how he had once looked up to the Sixth Layer Master, only to now crush him underfoot, he marveled at how well his money had been spent.

Gongshu Jin: What's up?

Ji Yuanshu: Did your team give the other Seven Absolutes to Zhang Yu?

Gongshu Jin: Yeah.

Ji Yuanshu: The War Faction must have given you a lot of support, right?

Gongshu Jin: Without Director Gao's backing, we wouldn't have gotten this far.

Ji Yuanshu: [Thumbs up]

After his exchange with Ji Yuanshu, an idea surged in Gongshu Jin's mind.

"Come to think of it, if I can master three Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering and grasp the Minor Threefold Combination before Ji Yuanshu does, I might always stay one step ahead of him in our future civil engineering careers."

How could he surpass Ji Yuanshu?

Gongshu Jin had tried throwing money at the problem before, but failed.

Later, he invested in the Competition Team and successfully obtained the Profound Yellow Mountain-Suppressing Seal.

"To be precise, I wasn't just investing in the Competition Team, but in my faith in Zhang Yu."

"I need to maintain a good relationship with Zhang Yu. If another opportunity like this arises, I'll seize it even more fiercely."

"What does Zhang Yu like?"

Gongshu Jin's mind raced through information about Zhang Yu.

"Overtime? Medicine? Food? Massages?"

Ying Xin: I got seventh place in the Civil Engineering Competition!

Third Generation Patriarch: Well done! Did you use the bone ash?

Ying Xin: Great-Grandfather, thanks to smearing your bone ash on the arena, we managed to hold out through the first half of the final round.

Fifth Generation Patriarch: Now you're officially a staunch supporter of the War Faction. Next, we need to find you a good teacher.

Fifth Generation Madam: Send the bone ash whenever you need it. If you run out of money, we'll send you more.

Fourth Generation Patriarch: Especially Zhang Yu — you need to cultivate a good relationship with him. Ideally, we should get him to join our clan.

Ying Xin: I've tried probing him, but I get the sense he's one of those ascetic types with no interest in such things. His eyes are fixed solely on cultivation and overtime.

Feeling the warmth of her family's concern, Ying Xin smiled faintly.

Suddenly, her gaze sharpened. "What about the Founding Ancestor?" she asked.

Fifth Generation Patriarch: The First Generation Patriarch's consciousness is temporarily frozen.

Fifth Generation Patriarch: Maintaining his consciousness is becoming increasingly expensive. We have to keep him frozen most of the time to survive on the bare minimum.

Fifth Generation Patriarch: But don't worry. As long as we keep paying his fees on time, he can hold on a little longer.

Ying Xin sighed inwardly. Even if they could keep him alive, with more descendants being frozen and the unfrozen ones growing increasingly distant from the First Generation Patriarch... it was only a matter of time before they could no longer afford the fees.

Unless a descendant rose to prominence, achieved great wealth, and made a fortune, there was no hope of giving their ancestors another lifetime — until the fees became unaffordable once more.

Yu Xinghan continuously observed the muscle patterns of Shi Huaiyu before him using his Third Eye Mystic Power.

Next, he channeled energy into his fingertips, sending waves of force deep into her body.

Simultaneously, a surge of Magic Power followed, penetrating her meridians.

This was a massage cultivation art Yu Xinghan had learned from Professor Gong, the health management expert at the construction site. It not only conditioned muscles but also alleviated meridian strain, enhancing the efficiency of Magic Power cultivation.

However, as Yu Xinghan mastered these techniques, he realized they could also be lethal, capable of destroying flesh and meridians.

When he asked Professor Gong about this, the professor chuckled, "Indeed, it incorporates elements of ancient assassination arts."

"But that's just for your knowledge. In modern times, killing relies on wealth. With money, you can kill however you please; without it, you can't even afford to kill a commoner. Assassination techniques are utterly useless."

"You have a natural talent for therapeutic rehabilitation. With the University Realm in turmoil and the shadow of war looming, I believe rehabilitation and therapy will have immense market potential across various sectors, not just construction sites. You must work hard."

Watching Shi Huaiyu groan in comfort, Yu Xinghan suggested, "Senior Sister, I can also perform kidney maintenance later. Would you like to get a membership card? It's guaranteed to be more cost-effective than going to a salon."

"I've been turning almost all the Competition Team members into clients, and through them, I've started attracting more senior clients."

As Yu Xinghan reflected on his steadily rising overall score and income, he felt increasingly grateful for joining the Competition Team.

Just then, he received a message from Lian Tianji.

Lian Tianji: Xinghan, I saw your post on Moments. Congratulations on taking seventh place in the competition!

Yu Xinghan: I saw your photo too. Is that girl a classmate from Joyful Union University?

Lian Tianji: That's me.

Yu Xinghan: Huh?

Lian Tianji: After successfully achieving Foundation Establishment, I transferred to the Foundation Establishment Yang Extremity Class in my department. Only the top student in the class can remain male.

Yu Xinghan: What?!

Lian Tianji: Conversely, in the Yin Extremity Class, only the top student can remain female.

Lian Tianji: I considered my options carefully before choosing a class. In the end, I decided to endure hardship now for future rewards.

Just then, Shi Huaiyu, still getting treatment from Yu Xinghan's, groaned softly. "Yu Xinghan, what are you doing?"

Yu Xinghan apologized profusely and refocused his attention on Shi Huaiyu.

Meanwhile, a voice echoed in his mind:

"Zhang Yu! Joyful Union University isn't our paradise!"

"But if we're not local students, but tourists..."

Yu Xinghan had to admit, his interest was piqued.

At that moment, Li Xuelian sent a message.

Li Xuelian: Good results. It wasn't a waste nurturing you and Zhang Yu.

Li Xuelian: I've connected you with some injured students from the Security Department.

Li Xuelian: See if you can do business with them.

Yu Xinghan returned to the dormitory, intending to discuss intelligence about Joyful Union University with Zhang Yu. However, a glance at Zhang Yu's current state revealed he was on a call with Bai Zhenzhen.

Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhang Yu and said cheerfully, "Your team took seventh place in the Departmental Competition this time?"

Zhang Yu nodded and began recounting the competition's events, drawing a wide smile from Bai Zhenzhen on the other end of the line.

"Great!" Bai Zhenzhen exclaimed. "We're getting closer to the Ten Greats League!"

Zhang Yu nodded. "Yeah, A-Zhen, let's keep improving together. We can even join the same sect someday."

Lady Fortune thought to herself, "One's competing in the Inter-University League, while the other's in the Departmental Competition. The gap between them is enormous... Bai Zhenzhen is really trying to make Zhang Yu look good."

"Haha," Bai Zhenzhen laughed. "Did Mom's Azure Silk Flying Sword come in handy during the competition?"

"It was useful, but a bit lacking," Zhang Yu replied. "Can I get more?"

"Do you think pulling out a strand of hair is all it takes?" Bai Zhenzhen retorted. "It's forged with the Seven Emotions Sword Intent — it's not something you can just conjure up!"

"Besides," she added, "as your strength grows, the Azure Silk Flying Sword will become increasingly inadequate. You'll need to upgrade to a new magical artifact eventually."

Zhang Yu shook his head. "No need to replace it. Even if I don't use the Azure Silk Flying Sword for combat, it can still connect to the network in critical moments. I want to keep it with me."

Bai Zhenzhen suddenly asked, "You keep it with you all the time?"

Zhang Yu smiled and raised his right hand, showing the Azure Silk Flying Sword worn like a ring on his finger. "Yeah, I always carry it with me. It can connect to the network in the wilderness and cut materials on construction sites — it's really convenient."

Bai Zhenzhen stared at the strand of hair on his finger. "So... you wear it even when you're... playing?"

Zhang Yu paused, then snapped, "That's not playing! That's work! I'm earning money. Don't forget, I'm the one who supported you through high school, bit by bit."

Bai Zhenzhen: "Uh-huh... work."

Bai Zhenzhen added, "By the way, can you stop talking so much nonsense with Wen Wuya?"

Zhang Yu nodded. "I get paid just for sending him random stuff every day. I can't stop now."

Bai Zhenzhen rolled her eyes. "Every time he sees me now, he starts talking about civil engineering and construction sites. I'm about to lose my mind."

Zhang Yu said, "I'll see what I can do."

After ending the call, Bai Zhenzhen heard the Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' voice in her ear: "What do you two think you're doing, treating Wen Wuya like this?"

Startled by the sudden voice, Bai Zhenzhen patted her chest and replied, "Treating him like Zhang Yu's wallet, of course."

The Divine Monarch Seven Emotions asked curiously, "Even now, you still don't see the vast difference between Zhang Yu and yourself?"

"Forget Zhang Yu himself; even the most outstanding student in his department can't compare to Wen Wuya."

"Wen Wuya is your true peer, and in the long run, he's the more suitable connection for you."

Bai Zhenzhen retorted, "Mom, if everything is about money and benefits, is that still love? Can you still cultivate the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao?"

The Divine Monarch Seven Emotions said calmly, "If wealth and benefits are integrated as part of measuring emotions, why can't that still be the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao?"

Bai Zhenzhen countered, "But wouldn't you rather see me transcend all that, using pure, extreme emotions to fuel my Sword Intent?"

"Trying to figure out my intentions?" The Divine Monarch Seven Emotions chuckled. "The time and lifespan of a Soul Transformation cultivator are far greater than you imagine. Instead of guessing my motives, you'd be better off spending more time understanding your own true desires."
