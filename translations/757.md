# Chapter 757: Dao Seed? Immortal Spiritual Root? Reincarnation Memories?

Since arriving at the Eleventh Layer of Kunxu, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had been sent to a training academy along with the other Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs.

The entire academy was a closed environment. Aside from specific scheduled activities, they were not permitted to wander freely around the Eleventh Layer.

However, the academy itself was vast, like a small city. Its internal facilities were comprehensive, and the supply of basic cultivation resources was abundant, sufficient to meet the fundamental needs of the Soul Transformation experts.

Besides Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's group, the city already housed many Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs from the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Layers. Most were preparing to undertake contracted work for the sect, while a few were newly ascended Soul Transformation experts, all currently undergoing training in the city.

Everyone here was a Soul Transformation expert. Having broken through less than two years ago, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole naturally found it difficult to earn the envy or respect of the others.

At their level, what mattered more was one's relationship with the sect.

The Soul Transformation experts who had ascended from the Seventh to Tenth Layers included many veterans who had advanced years ago. They were slated to remain in the sect for contracted work, operating on the Eleventh Layer and above, and enjoying partial sect benefits. Subconsciously, they already considered themselves superior.

As for the new Soul Transformation experts like Magnetic Pole and Greenwood, who had come from the Fifth Layer for training and were destined to return, the contracted Soul Transformation experts held them in disdain.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole understood that while she could command respect and authority on the Second to Fifth Layers, here in the sect, she was just one of many Soul Transformation experts summoned from below for training. She couldn't expect the same smooth sailing as before.

But now, after reviewing the latest list of admitted Sect Staff, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole seemed to have gained a solid sense of confidence. She would approach any Soul Transformation Divine Monarch she encountered and strike up a conversation about the Sect Examination.

With a flash of divine light, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole appeared before another Soul Transformation Divine Monarch.

"The Sect Examination is difficult, isn't it?" she asked.

The veteran Soul Transformation expert replied, "Of course, it's as hard as ascending to heaven. Take the Eleventh Layer's examination, for example. It's like a thousand soldiers crossing a single-plank bridge. Many candidates have blood ties to sect disciples, yet they've failed for decades..."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole listened patiently to the veteran's explanation, then asked with sincere earnestness, "I have a student who has been determined to join the sect since his undergraduate years. Is the examination really that competitive? Do you think my student still has a chance?"

The veteran Soul Transformation expert scoffed, mocking Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's wishful thinking. He began to lecture her on how low the probability was for someone from the lower layers to enter the sect, how impossible it was, and how much stricter the sect's policies had become in recent years...

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole frowned. "Could I have misread it?"

She projected the new list of admitted Sect Staff and pointed to a name. "Zhang Yu, True Monarch Blazing Light, a graduate of Myriad Laws... According to this information, he should be my disciple."

The Soul Transformation Divine Monarch before her widened his eyes. A moment later, his expression changed abruptly, and his posture subtly shrank... Unconsciously, he seemed to have diminished in stature before Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

The veteran spoke politely, "Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, you have taught your disciple well."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole continued to approach other Soul Transformation experts one by one. She would ask about the difficulty of the Sect Examination, whether she had misread the list, or inquire about the Edict Pavilion, wondering if it was a low-power office.

Even the contracted Soul Transformation experts who usually looked down on Magnetic Pole, Greenwood, and the Ten Universities Soul Transformation Experts were subdued that day. After glancing at the admission list, some turned away with a sneer, while others forced a smile and approached Magnetic Pole.

Only in their private small groups did someone quietly remark, "So what if he passed the Sect Staff exam? Anyone who didn't know better would think he'd become the sect leader."

Another sneered behind her back, "He's made it to the other side, but he might not even acknowledge his old master anymore. [Smile]"

Regardless, ascending to the sect was something to be envied. Even Soul Transformation cultivators yearned for it.

After all, in the current Kunxu, the only path to the apex of the Immortal Dao lay within the sect. This was especially true for Soul Transformation experts, who could only advance further by entering the sect.

When a disciple or student ascended to the sect, even the slightest favor they might show in the future would bring endless benefits.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, who had once held absolute power in the lower layers, had felt stifled ever since arriving at the Eleventh Layer's training school. Only now did she finally feel a sense of vindication.

"Sinful Lotus, help me look. There are too many names, I can't find them all. How many of our Myriad Laws students passed the Sect Examination?"

As she spoke, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole projected a list filled with the names of the newly admitted Sect Staff, sincerely asking Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus for help.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus glanced at the list and retorted irritably, "Even if they entered the sect, they might not remember you. Haven't you heard about the sacrifices some cultivators make just to pass the Sect Examination?"

"For Zhang Yu to pass in such a short time, he probably paid a considerable price."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled faintly and said, "Zhang Yu is different. He will definitely remember me, his master."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's lips twitched. "Then let's see if he comes to visit you after he ascends."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole snorted coldly. "He just passed the Sect Staff exam. He'll be incredibly busy with work after he ascends. So what if he doesn't visit me?"

She magnified the projected list and searched. "Come, come, Sinful Lotus, let me help you find your disciple. Let's see which position he got."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus flicked his sleeve and turned away. In the next moment, he transformed into a streak of divine light and vanished, leaving only his voice echoing in the air: "No need to look. I, Sinful Lotus, don't rely on students or disciples. I walk the Immortal Dao solely on my own strength."

Nearby, Divine Monarch Nether Spring scanned the admission list several times before sighing. "He didn't make it?"

Elsewhere, Divine Monarch Wisdom Foundation of Vajra University turned to Divine Monarch Greenwood beside him and remarked, "I never thought Zhang Yu would actually ascend to the sect."

Recalling how he had once formed Zhang Yu's Nascent Soul, he said to Divine Monarch Greenwood, "Greenwood, you still remember the three favors you promised to help with, right?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood said, "Of course I remember, but it was I who made the promise. It has nothing to do with Zhang Yu."

Divine Monarch Wisdom Foundation shook his head and said, "Greenwood, Zhang Yu just ascended to the sect. This is when your relationship is at its warmest. If you get a chance to contact him later, you should seize the opportunity to cash in on that favor."

"After cultivating for so many years, you and I should know... people change. This is even more true once they enter the sect."

"Haven't you heard about the situation on the Eleventh Layer? The longer someone stays in the sect, the less they value their connections outside it."

"Those few students from your Myriad Laws University who ascended... it won't be long before they probably stop considering themselves part of Myriad Laws University at all."

Divine Monarch Greenwood remained silent, his gaze fixed on Zhang Yu's name on the list, a wave of emotion washing over him. Suddenly, he felt old.

This feeling of age didn't stem from any physical or spiritual decline but from the stark contrast between himself and Zhang Yu.

"With my potential, Soul Transformation is already my limit."

"But Zhang Yu's future holds infinite possibilities."

"On the sect path ahead, there's nothing more I can do to help him."

At this thought, Divine Monarch Greenwood felt an even stronger sense of melancholy: his disciple was thriving, heading toward a vast future, while he could only remain stationary, silently watching Zhang Yu's back recede further and further into the distance.

After finishing his speech, Zhang Yu returned to the Research Association aboard the Flying Boat.

Watching Zhang Yu's departing figure, Deng Bingding received a message from her superior Righteous God: "[Thumbs Up] [Thumbs Up] [Thumbs Up]"

Seeing the three thumbs-up emojis, Deng Bingding's heart surged with excitement. She knew her superiors were highly satisfied with today's arrangements and Zhang Yu's speech.

Deng Bingding resolved to handle the Sect Examination's publicity campaign with utmost care, ideally by persuading Zhang Yu to participate in a few more events.

"If I can distinguish myself and take charge of more tasks related to the regularization of the Sect Examination... I might just be able to move up the ranks."

Deng Bingding understood that as the Sect Examination became a regular occurrence, there would be countless tasks to manage across the First to Tenth Layers. This process held immense potential for earning merit, and countless Righteous Gods were now eyeing it hungrily.

So many Righteous Gods wanted to achieve something significant during this period to secure a chance for promotion.

Meanwhile, on his way back, Zhang Yu encountered Bei Wufeng, Jin Jun, and Yan Qianji.

Jin Jun and the other two had left the laboratory and rushed to the Kunxu Fifth Layer to welcome Zhang Yu. Along the way, they discovered that quite a few people had the same idea. The Heavenly Court had even proactively arranged for many people to be there, which made the trio even less conspicuous.

Fortunately, the three were still nominally Zhang Yu's subordinates. After making contact, they finally managed to board the Flying Boat.

Upon seeing Zhang Yu, the trio appeared somewhat reserved. After all, Zhang Yu now held the additional title of Sect Staff, creating a thick barrier between them.

However, Zhang Yu immediately saw through their thoughts and said casually, "You three are planning to take the Sect Examination next year, right?"

"If you have any questions, just ask. I'll answer what I can."

Seeing that Zhang Yu seemed as approachable as ever, Yan Qianji grew bolder and asked directly, "True Monarch, you haven't refined your physical body into a Bionic Frame, nor do you rely heavily on Bionics for daily activities or cultivation. Is this to train yourself?"

"Does doing this increase the chances of passing the Sect Examination?"

Zhang Yu sighed helplessly. "I wouldn't advise you to do that."

"The truth is, I couldn't afford it before, and later I ran out of time. Once I get to the sect and have the opportunity, I'll still refine and strengthen my physical body."

On the way back, Zhang Yu shared some insights about the Sect Examination with the three, who all felt they had gained a great deal.

Meanwhile, Deng Bingding sent new event invitations. Zhang Yu accepted a few and declined the rest.

Zhang Yu knew that since he was heading to the sect in a month, he had many things to accomplish in the remaining time.

"For a while after I first enter the sect, I probably won't have the same freedom of action as I do down here."

"As for artifact refinement... once I'm in the Edict Pavilion, I probably won't have any opportunities for a while."

"I need to make the most of this month to prepare as thoroughly as possible and lay the groundwork for my journey in the sect."

After some thought, Zhang Yu had already planned out his schedule for the next month.

Inside the laboratory, Zhang Yu closed his eyes and pondered for a moment before looking at the blueprints Ye Xingli had designed. "Senior Sister, what do you think of this design?"

Zhang Yu was currently collaborating with Ye Xingli to design Foundation Establishment Stage magical artifacts.

His goal, naturally, was to upgrade Ye Xingli's Dao Seed, "Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart," to Level 2.

To achieve this, he and Ye Xingli needed to jointly design ten Foundation Establishment magical artifacts.

This task wasn't particularly difficult, but over the past two years, Zhang Yu had been far too busy dealing with wave after wave of pressure, crises, and powerful enemies.

Whether it was striving for the Golden Core stage, breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, promoting the Immortal Sect Technique, designing spatial magical artifacts, or preparing for the Sect Examination — each task was more urgent than the last, leaving no room for delay and consuming nearly all his time and energy.

Under such circumstances, Zhang Yu hadn't even had time to upgrade his own basic stats or numerous cultivation arts, let alone the "Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart" Dao Seed.

Fortunately, now he finally had the leisure to complete the upgrade.

Ye Xingli gazed at the stockings she and Zhang Yu were designing together, thinking to herself, "Junior Brother... he's so busy, yet he's taking the time to personally guide me in magical artifact design?"

From her perspective, what benefit could Zhang Yu possibly gain from designing low-level magical artifacts with her? The only explanation she could think of was that he wanted to mentor her.

Coincidentally, the position Ye Xingli planned to apply for at the Myriad Laws Sect was also related to artifact refinement.

"Is Junior Brother guiding me specifically because he hopes I'll secure the artifact refinement position in the sect?"

The thought that Zhang Yu not only wanted to bring her up to the sect but was also willing to invest so much time in her guidance sparked an idea in Ye Xingli's mind: "Junior Brother has invested so much in me... Could it be... he wants to be my dad?"

Recalling the sect customs she had learned from True Monarch Starfire, she mused, "If it's Junior Brother... I wouldn't mind him being my dad."

At this thought, Ye Xingli looked at Zhang Yu with solemn determination and said, "Junior Brother, I will definitely get into the sect."

Meeting her gaze, which burned with fighting spirit, Zhang Yu nodded. "Senior Sister, I know you can do it."

Ye Xingli asked, "Junior Brother, speaking of which... why are you designing stockings?"

Zhang Yu replied, "After A-Zhen went to the Heavenly Sword Sect, I probably won't see her for a long time. I wanted to help her prepare more, and bringing extra stockings is part of that."

"After all, stockings are easy to wear and are close-fitting equipment. You could say they exist somewhere between Bionic and magical artifacts. I believe stockings are the most suitable equipment for all cultivators."

"I plan to start by designing some basic models to gain experience, then create a Nascent Soul-Tier version for her."

---

Inside the Meditation Chamber.

Zhang Yu placed one hand on Yu Xinghan's back, channeling streams of Magic Power into his body.

He was helping Yu Xinghan increase his Magic Power to pursue a further upgrade for the Third Eye Mystic Power.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "After we ascend to the sect, Yu Xinghan and I will be temporarily separated for work in different places. I probably won't be able to help him improve for a while."

"If I can upgrade the Third Eye Mystic Power by one level before entering the sect, it should be a significant help for my future work at the Edict Hall."

"Although the Third Eye Mystic Power has undergone two transformations from Evil God Rituals, its level on the Dao Seed Register has never increased."

Right now, Zhang Yu only needed to help Yu Xinghan raise his Magic Power above 8000 to complete the upgrade for the Third Eye Mystic Power.

It had been nearly two years since Yu Xinghan broke through to the Golden Core realm, and his Magic Power was now approaching 8000 units.

Feeling Zhang Yu continuously channeling Magic Power into him, Yu Xinghan couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "What a true brother!"

Reflecting on their journey together, Yu Xinghan knew that Zhang Yu had become his most trusted companion.

"If I weren't so set on my original gender... if I absolutely had to choose a man for dual cultivation, I'd choose you. Even Teacher Starfire would be second."

Zhang Yu's lips twitched at the comment. "I appreciate the sentiment," he said, "but if such a good thing were to happen, I'd still recommend you choose True Monarch Starfire."

"Besides Ye Xingli's and Yu Xinghan's Dao Seeds, there was also Bai Zhenzhen's..."

Zhang Yu wanted to help her achieve an upgrade before entering the sect as well.

"After all, Bai Zhenzhen had been admitted to the Heavenly Sword Sect. Once she joins, she will be much farther away than Yu Xinghan or Ye Xingli."

However, Zhang Yu had a lingering concern about the next upgrade for the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo.

"The Azure Lotus Sword Embryo already evolved from a Heavenly Spiritual Root to a Divine Spiritual Root."

"And during their time at the university, each upgrade had made it progressively stronger."

Zhang Yu could feel that the next upgrade for the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo... its power might surpass the realm of a Divine Spiritual Root.

"An Immortal Spiritual Root... Will the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo become an Immortal Spiritual Root?"

Zhang Yu wasn't sure, but he wasn't willing to gamble.

So, before upgrading the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo, he planned to contact an old acquaintance to inquire about the situation 'up there', to find out if Bai Zhenzhen would face trouble in the Heavenly Sword Sect if she possessed an Immortal Spiritual Root, and if so, whether there were ways to avoid it.

Looking at Kuang Tianqing before him, Zhang Yu asked, "Has the Reincarnation Group agreed to my request?"

Previously, through his discussions with Kuang Tianqing, Zhang Yu had established a cooperative relationship with the Reincarnation Group.

After helping Kuang Tianqing pass his interview using the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture, Zhang Yu was granted the right to retrieve a deceased person's memory through the Reincarnation System.

"Today was the day to fulfill that promise."

Kuang Tianqing nodded. "The higher-ups have granted you access. You can now try circulating the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture to connect with Reincarnation and retrieve a deceased person's memory."

Zhang Yu nodded, closed his eyes, and began circulating the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture.

A moment later, a figure violently struggled out of his body, like a self-aware clone peeling itself away from his flesh and blood, bit by bit.

Watching the person emerge from his own body, Zhang Yu sighed softly. "Long time no see."
