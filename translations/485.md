# Chapter 485: Campus Traitor

Immortal Armaments University.

Wan Gouxuan stared at his teacher, his face filled with astonishment. "Teacher, are you serious?"

The teacher nodded, glancing at the giant puppet standing nearby. "Yes, all post-competition repair costs will be fully reimbursed."

"In your next match against Myriad Laws University, regardless of the extent of damage to the Earth Surge God, the school will cover all expenses."

Wan Gouxuan's heart surged with excitement. He nearly wanted to detonate the giant puppet on the spot, just to get a brand-new replacement immediately.

The towering military-grade puppet before him — the Earth Surge God — was the Civil Engineering Department's military-grade powerhouse.

Through years of maintenance and upgrades, the Earth Surge God had been repeatedly used by generations of Civil Engineering students who had earned their Military Certificates.

Its construction capabilities were undeniable. From its internal Power Dantian, capable of storing 10,000 units of Magic Power, to its Earth Vein Vibration Joints that could reshape terrain, and the Mountain Vein Manifestation newly installed last year for the Spirit Vein relocation project, every feature granted the Earth Surge God terrifying operational power far surpassing that of ordinary Foundation Establishment individuals.

This Giant Military-Grade Puppet should have been a strong contender for first place in the Civil Engineering Inter-University Competition. However, due to the crippling maintenance costs, Wan Gouxuan had never dared to fully unleash the Earth Surge God's power for an entire year.

In past competitions, he had often used his teammates as human shields for the Earth Surge God, reasoning that their repair costs were often far cheaper than the puppet's.

He often lamented, "It's my insufficient Immortal Dao Potential that limits the Earth Surge God's performance."

But now, with the maintenance costs for the upcoming match fully reimbursed, Wan Gouxuan felt his combat power surge wildly! Explode! Skyrocket! It was so overwhelming that even he felt like a stranger to himself.

This battle would not only allow him to fully unleash the Earth Surge God's power, but the more intense the fight and the more severe the damage to the puppet, the more new components he could replace afterward, making it even stronger and paving the way for greater profits in the future!

Just then, the teacher noticed the change in Wan Gouxuan's expression and quickly warned, "Deliberate damage will not be reimbursed."

"Just fight normally and suppress Zhang Yu. Understand?"

Wan Gouxuan sighed inwardly, feeling a pang of regret, but nodded and replied, "I understand."

The Teacher continued, "And you remember what you're supposed to do during the competition, right?"

A cruel smile curled Wan Gouxuan's lips as he slowly said, "Using the competition as an opportunity, I'll thoroughly humiliate Zhang Yu on the field!"

The Teacher frowned, correcting him sharply, "What nonsense are you spouting? It's not just you — it's your entire team."

"Remember, after completely suppressing him, collect his bodily materials and conduct tests on his flesh using the methods the Professor taught you..."

Wan Gouxuan nodded repeatedly. With the promise of full reimbursement for repair costs, he felt utterly confident in completing the task.

The only problem was... what if Zhang Yu didn't participate in the next competition?

Right now, Wan Gouxuan's greatest fear was that Zhang Yu wouldn't show up.

"Zhang Yu, you absolutely must continue competing."

"I can't wait any longer."

Myriad Laws University.

Ping Han gazed at the familiar street scenes, blending back into the bustling crowds, a hint of melancholy surfacing in his heart.

"I never thought I, Ping Han, would ever return here."

Just then, someone touched Ping Han's arm and said, "You remember your mission, right?"

Ping Han flinched slightly, indicating he remembered perfectly.

Fu Xinyao, a disciple of Joyful Union University, nodded curtly, tightening her grip on Ping Han beneath her abdomen. "Then don't do anything unnecessary."

"Our only task here is to pinpoint the location of the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact. Nothing else matters."

"Whatever thoughts linger in your mind — regrets, debts, grudges... forget them all."

Ping Han quickly replied, "I understand. I'm merely Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Yin Artifact."

He knew that sending him as a spy to Myriad Laws University, to guide the Joyful Union University disciples, was merely a casual move for Divine Monarch Jade Nectar. Whether it succeeded or failed mattered little to her; she could obliterate him with a single thought.

But for Ping Han himself, success or failure would determine his future fate.

Ping Han volunteered, "I'll take you to Zhang Yu first. Since he's involved in the Yin Artifact Experiment, following him should lead us to the laboratory."

However, moments later, Ping Han said helplessly, "It won't work. Without Myriad Laws University student credentials, there are too many places we can't access."

Only then did Ping Han realize that the University City, which he had once roamed freely, actually had strict restrictions on non-Myriad Laws University students. He had simply never noticed it before.

Fu Xinyao wasn't surprised. It would have been inconceivable for Myriad Laws University to allow her to wander freely and easily locate such an important target.

Before coming here, she had already prepared for this mission to take considerable time.

After all, without this opportunity, how else could she have borrowed Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Soul Transformation-level Bionic?

Thinking of this, she couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. Patting Ping Han, she thought to herself, "This venture into Myriad Laws University is the perfect chance to test the power of this Soul Transformation Bionic and prove my Joyful Union Divine Power."

Fu Xinyao asked, "Do you know anyone here?"

After dozens of attempts, Ping Han discovered that every single person had blocked him.

Fu Xinyao sighed. "Useless."

She continued, "Let's start small. Where do students from the Civil Engineering and Security Departments usually hang out?"

Ping Han struggled to speak. "Could we... maybe skip the Civil Engineering Department?"

A crackling sound erupted as Fu Xinyao's fingertip, crackling with electricity, pierced Ping Han's body.

She let out a soft, mocking laugh. "Looks like my training hasn't been very effective. You still lack the awareness of an artifact spirit."

"Do you think you're still a Civil Engineering student at Myriad Laws University? Refusing to help me deal with your former department?"

"Then I'll specifically target Civil Engineering students — the poorest, the worst-performing, and the ugliest ones..."

*Gah!* 

Ping Han cried out inwardly, his body convulsing. He clamped his mouth shut, daring not to utter another word of protest.

Amidst the incessant beeping of warning alarms, Zhang Yu stared in disbelief at the crimson alerts flashing before him. "What's going on?" he muttered. "What do you mean I'm not allowed to leave Myriad Laws University?"

Seeing these warnings projected from the Spirit Realm, Zhang Yu immediately connected to the Spirit Realm address listed below them. He was met with a deluge of manuals demanding he read and research them.

As he delved deeper into the manuals, his frustration grew. He thought of the unfinished engineering project and the overdue payment... The Divine Spiritual Root in his Dantian began to tremble faintly under the weight of his agitation.

Simultaneously, the Four-Headed White Bull in his mind roared violently. For a fleeting moment, he glimpsed a fifth bull's head surging beneath his skin, as if about to burst through.

Zhang Yu's flesh and blood surged with the bull's roar, each cell seeming to gain consciousness and clamoring to break free from his body.

*Huff...*

Zhang Yu let out a soft breath, calming the agitation in his heart.

During tests of his Divine Spiritual Root's emotional amplification ability, Zhang Yu had discovered that beyond enhancing the effects of the Chain Method Diagram Set, it also influenced his Dao Heart, seemingly amplifying the effects of the Remnant Ox's Self-Sacrifice Heart Sutra and the Immeasurable Heart Inner Dharma Body.

As Zhang Yu's emotions settled, his previously turbulent Dao Heart regained its stability.

"How long will this endless searching go on?"

Suppressing his emotions, Zhang Yu's mind raced, and hypotheses quickly formed in his mind.

He recalled the words of True Monarch Celestial Seal and the teacher who had visited his laboratory earlier, estimating that this situation was likely related to the Yin Artifact Experiment.

Zhang Yu immediately contacted True Monarch Magnetic Pole, informing her of the blockade he had encountered.

---

Just as Zhang Yu was being intercepted, Feng Yuhuan sat in his office at the Research Department of Myriad Laws University, watching the confirmation that Zhang Yu had been successfully stopped. He nodded slightly. "Hmph, good thing I prepared in advance. Otherwise, the university's assets would have been so easily lost."

"Did they really think other universities were blind? That Divine Monarch Jade Nectar would just swallow her pride?"

"Sigh, even the most basic measures like prohibiting him from leaving University City require my intervention."

After glancing at the video feed from surveillance cameras near Zhang Yu and confirming he was heading back, Feng Yuhuan began drafting his next application.

"The risks outside University City are immense, but the dangers within are no less real," he mused. "At this very moment, rival universities' corporate spies might be probing for information about the experiment and searching for Zhang Yu's location."

"The Soul Transformation Yin Artifact is of paramount importance. Whether it's the technological value it embodies or its origin from Divine Monarch Jade Nectar, none of it can be allowed to leak."

"Experimental results like Zhang Yu's should be treated like the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact itself — locked away in the laboratory at all times. His studies and cultivation can all be conducted within the laboratory as well..."

As he pondered, Feng Yuhuan refined his wording, drafted the document, and submitted it. Afterward, he couldn't help but sigh. "If it weren't for me, with True Monarch Magnetic Pole's lax attitude, who knows how much of the university's assets would have been lost?"

"The risks here are too great. I need to bring this to the leadership's attention."

With that thought, Feng Yuhuan sent the document and simultaneously copied it to the Vice Principal for review.

---

Shortly after Zhang Yu returned to his dormitory, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's Spirit Realm Projection descended and materialized before him.

Looking at Zhang Yu, she said, "I've investigated the situation. Feng Yuhuan from the Research Department submitted the request to restrict your movements, hoping you wouldn't leave University City."

"Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations has already approved it."

"Ah?" Zhang Yu exclaimed in surprise. "Even the Divine Monarch agreed?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied calmly, "The Soul Transformation Divine Monarch handles countless matters daily. To him, this is a trivial matter. If he deems it reasonable, he approves it; if he finds issues later, he can revoke it at any time."

"I'm here to ask for your own perspective on this."
