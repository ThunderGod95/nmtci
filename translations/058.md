# Chapter 58: Pressure

Roar!

With a furious roar, Lan Ling’s muscles bulged. A terrifyingly immense force erupted from within him, forcibly resisting the pressure of the Detainment Talisman.

"So strong, are you?" Zhang Yu slowly walked up to Lan Ling, watching as his opponent’s power surged, bit by bit breaking free of the Detainment Talisman.

Zhang Yu brandished the Talisman Tome bearing the Inspection Department's mark and said with a smile, “The Inspection Department is on official business, by divine authority. You wish to resist? To make an enemy of the gods?”

Staring at the Inspection Department's Talisman Tome, Lan Ling's eyes suddenly narrowed, a flash of disbelief in their depths.

_This poor bastard joined the Inspection Department?_

The next moment, he shattered the Detainment Talisman with a deafening crack but did not move rashly again. He simply stared at Zhang Yu with a scrutinizing gaze, as if seeing him for the first time.

Seeing that Lan Ling was no longer fighting, Zhang Yu shot a smug smile at Bai Zhenzhen, who was a short distance away, thinking to himself, _I must look cool as hell today._

Bai Zhenzhen stared intently at the Talisman Tome in Zhang Yu’s hand, thinking, _Where did Yu-boy get a Talisman Tome like that? …I have to borrow it for a bit._

Meanwhile, the crowd looked on in astonishment as Zhang Yu suddenly appeared and repelled Lan Ling with a single Detainment Talisman.

He Dayou watched the scene unfold, his expression a mixture of shock and suspicion.

_How did Zhang Yu get into a divine ministry?_

Zhao Tianxing’s heart was filled with both nervousness and fear.

_Zhang Yu actually bought a Talisman Tome? Did he take the day off to sell an organ?_

But in the next moment, he shook his head violently, ashamed of his own train of thought.

_Is this really the time to be thinking about that? How did Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen get into a conflict with a second-year senior? That's the real problem here._

Even so, a hint of envy still surfaced in Zhao Tianxing’s eyes as he looked at Zhang Yu, and an irrepressible thought bubbled up within him.

_Going head-to-head with a second-year senior like that… is actually kind of cool._

Qian Shen stared at the Talisman Tome in Zhang Yu's hand, utterly astonished.

_Zhang Yu’s Daoist art exam score is going to skyrocket!_

Just as Zhang Yu and Lan Ling were locked in a stare-down and the atmosphere grew increasingly tense, the temperature of the entire training ground suddenly began to plummet.

A cloud of white vapor even rose from Lan Ling’s body, which had been in strenuous motion just moments before, due to the sudden temperature change.

He gave Zhang Yu a cold snort, then slowly backed away, turning his head toward the main entrance.

"President."

All eyes turned in the direction he had spoken.

Accompanied by a set of footsteps, Zhou Chechen walked over slowly, frost spreading from beneath his feet.

Zhou Chechen, Vice President of the Student Council; the man who had spoken as the student representative at the start of the school year and whose name and face appeared on screen and over the broadcasts month after month for his litany of outstanding achievements.

He was the model student, the ultimate senior, and his very presence silenced the entire hall.

He Dayou was the first to react, bowing to Zhou Chechen and saying, "Greetings, senior."

This seemed to flip a switch, and nearly all the first-year students present bowed in unison, saying together, "Greetings, senior."

The second-year students, for their part, also bowed and called out, "Greetings, President."

Although he was nominally the Student Council Vice President, the third-year president was busy preparing for the college entrance exams, so all practical matters of the student council were, in fact, decided by Zhou Chechen.

In strength, academics, wealth, and authority… he was the school’s uncrowned king.

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhou Chechen as if they were watching a king receive the adulation of his court. They were the only two students in the entire hall who had not bowed their heads.

Zhou Chechen did not address Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen first, instead turning his gaze upon the second-year students as the frost emanating from his body grew ever denser.

"Shuang Youpeng, you ranked first in overall score and first in practical combat as a first-year. What did you think of the fight between Bai Zhenzhen and Lan Ling just now?"

From behind the group of second-year students, a second-year boy with a relatively smaller build stepped forward.

Under the crowd’s watch, his hands seemed to have a mind of their own, fidgeting with his hair and picking at his ear, his eyes full of fear as he looked at Zhou Chechen.

He said very cautiously, "She was careless, arrogant, and underestimated her opponent, failing to recognize the disparity between them."

Seeing Shuang Youpeng’s cowering appearance, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen felt like they were watching a dog wagging its tail and begging for scraps before Zhou Chechen.

Shuang Youpeng, once the top-ranked first-year student, now showed none of his former spirit.

Zhou Chechen nodded slightly and said, "From what I've seen, this year's strongest first-year combatant isn't as clever a fighter as you were."

Shuang Youpeng hurriedly waved his hands. "You flatter me, President. You flatter me."

Zhou Chechen then turned back to the first-year students and asked faintly, "Have you expressed your gratitude for your senior's guidance?"

The first-year students immediately bowed and said, "Thank you for your guidance, senior."

In a few short moments, Zhou Chechen had become the center of attention, holding every student captive with his every move, word, and glance.

It was only then that Zhou Chechen finally looked Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen in the eye, saying coolly, "Zhang Yu, the match between Bai Zhenzhen and Lan Ling was a normal instructional spar. Why did you attack a senior with a Detainment Talisman?"

As he spoke, he slowly raised his palm, from which streams of ice-blue mist emerged, causing the surrounding temperature to plummet once more.

Zhou Chechen continued, "As Vice President of the Songyang High School Student Council, I can tolerate neither the use of a Detainment Talisman on school grounds nor such disrespectful behavior toward a senior."

Zhang Yu’s eyes shifted as he raised the Talisman Tome in his hand.

"Zhou Chechen, do you intend to attack a Divine Assistant of the Inspection Department?"

Zhou Chechen’s eyelids lowered slightly, the corners of his mouth seeming to curl into a faint smile.

In his vision, the Heaven's Eye Talisman had already revealed the information hovering above Zhang Yu’s head.

Songyang City Patrol Unit Outsourced Employee (Expand for details)

_A mere outsourced contractor for the Patrol Unit, a position no bigger than a grain of rice, dares to run wild at Songyang High School?_

Just as the frigid energy in Zhou Chechen’s palm was about to erupt, a warm breeze suddenly swept in from all directions, not only dispersing the cold but also restoring the temperature to normal.

Zhang Pianpian entered the training ground through the main gate, accompanied by another young man.

"Are you trying to attack my temp?"

Zhou Chechen snapped his head around, and his gaze froze the moment he saw her face. 

_Zhang Pianpian? Why is she here? Is she going to back Zhang Yu?_

_Zhang Pianpian? Zhang Yu? Their surname is Zhang… are they related?_

But Zhou Chechen recalled checking Zhang Yu’s file; he didn't have any relatives this powerful.

If Zhang Yu really had such a powerful relative watching his back, dealing with him wouldn't have been so simple.

Zhou Chechen then wondered, _Or perhaps… Zhang Yu found a higher bidder and has become Zhang Pianpian’s dog?_

Seeing the lingering chill in Zhou Chechen’s palm, Zhang Pianpian continued walking toward the center of the room.

"Hm? Did you not hear me?"

"Or is it… you wish to make an enemy of me?"

As Zhang Pianpian spoke, she gently lifted her right index finger, and a Talisman Tome flew naturally to hover before it.

The next moment, Zhang Pianpian’s fingertip traced across the Talisman Tome at high speed.

Bai Zhenzhen watched in surprise, her eyes flicking to the school uniform Zhang Pianpian wore.

_White Dragon High School? What is she doing? Is she about to fight Zhou Chechen?_

Zhang Yu was also startled.

_She’s going to attack right away? What kind of talisman is she preparing? Another Detainment Talisman?_

As everyone watched with bated breath, Zhang Pianpian finished drawing the talisman, and a wave of mana pulsed from it.

Talisman of Dominance—activated!

Two lines of text suddenly materialized above Zhang Pianpian’s head.

The first line read: **White Dragon High School Third-Year Monthly Exam Total Score: 699**

The students staring at this score instantly widened their eyes, falling into a state of profound shock.

_A 699 on a third-year monthly exam?_ Qian Shen screamed internally. _That’s a god! A future god of the college entrance exams!_

Before the crowd could even process that score, the second line of text began to materialize above Zhang Pianpian’s head.

Bank Balance: 2

At first, it was just a 2, but a 5 quickly appeared after it.

And so it went, with another digit materializing every second.

25,000?

250,000?

2,500,000?!

By the time the number jumped to 25,000,000, the students present could feel their breathing quicken.

The students were now beginning to understand what kind of talisman Zhang Pianpian had used.

The Talisman of Dominance—a spell that called upon divine power to display one’s scores and bank balance as a form of intimidation.

When the number leaped to 250,000,000, the crowd felt their own vitality begin to surge uncontrollably.

And when the number finally stopped at 2,500,000,000, combined with the 699-point score above it, everyone felt an oppressive weight slam into them, like a great mountain pressing down on their chests.

This was merely her bank balance!

The thought of the assets and the power of the Immortal Dao that this number represented stirred their hearts.

Even He Dayou couldn't help but be shocked.

_Her bank balance alone is 2.5 billion? Just what is this woman’s total net worth?_

He couldn’t help but take out his own Talisman Tome and activate a Heaven's Eye Talisman, wanting to see her background for himself.

But all he saw were three large words hovering over her head.

You Are Not Worthy

She had used a talisman to conceal her background, making it completely impossible for him to investigate.

Upon seeing those words, He Dayou’s body trembled and his face went pale, as if he had been struck by lightning. It was as if he were seeing a great chasm stretching out between himself and Zhang Pianpian, one he could never hope to cross.

Zhao Tianxing stared intently at the string of digits above Zhang Pianpian's head, trying to count them again and again, but felt like he kept losing his place.

When he finally confirmed the number was 2.5 billion, he couldn’t help but gasp.

_So rich, she’s just so incredibly rich. The pressure from a wealthy person is really intense!_

In that moment, Zhao Tianxing was overwhelmed by a sense of inferiority, feeling as though he wasn’t even worthy to stand in the same room with her.

Zhang Yu was equally stunned.

_This is my wealthy older sister?_

_That's not right. I don't remember our family being wealthy at all._

_In fact, you could say we were dirt poor. So… where did Zhang Pianpian get all this money?_

_Something’s wrong… This is all wrong…_

The questions that had been nagging at him since the Divine Assistant assessment now crescendoed.

_How did she go from being penniless to a billionaire?_

_I… want to learn how, too._

Zhang Yu couldn't understand the reason, but no matter what...

_Sister, why did you leave us? Mom and I are your real family!_

Meanwhile, Zhou Chechen slowly dissipated the frigid energy in his palm.

His gaze swept imperceptibly over the score, the bank balance, and the words 'You Are Not Worthy' above her head several times.

Finally, he looked at Zhang Pianpian politely and said, “Senior Zhang, you’ve misunderstood. I was not aware that Zhang Yu was your subordinate. Had I known, why would I have made things difficult for him?”

Seeing her Talisman of Dominance had stunned the entire crowd, Zhang Pianpian nodded in satisfaction.

“Very good. I hope you remember what you’ve said today.”

"Don't let me hear about you causing any trouble for my subordinate. Otherwise, I’ll use this pocket change above my head to buy you."

"I'm sure your father would be more than happy to make the sale."

Hearing this, the corner of Zhou Chechen’s eye twitched, and for a moment, he was rendered speechless.

Just as a hush fell over the hall in the wake of her words, the young man who had entered with Zhang Pianpian laughed heartily.

“Pianpian is only joking. Don’t take it to heart, Junior Brother Zhou.”

The speaker was none other than Songyang High School’s top third-year student and the true president of the Student Council, Chu Chengxuan.
