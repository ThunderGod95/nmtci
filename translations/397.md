# Chapter 397: Zhang Yu's Military Certificate Plan

Upon hearing Director Gao mention the Military Certificate Examination, Zhang Yu's expression tightened, his gaze immediately becoming serious.

Ever since witnessing Mo Shangjin unleash the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power at the remote construction site, he had been deeply drawn to this military-grade cultivation technique of the Civil Engineering Department.

During the recent Civil Engineering Competition, Mo Shangjin's cultivation had advanced further, making his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power even more earth-shattering and sky-dominating.

This only strengthened Zhang Yu's resolve to master this martial art.

Sensing the ambition and desire burning in Zhang Yu's eyes, Director Gao smiled faintly. He never feared students with ambition and desire; to him, these were essential qualities for advancing courageously on the immortal path.

Conversely, those who lacked fighting spirit, were easily satisfied, or remained detached from worldly desires... these were the true obstacles to the Immortal Dao.

"The Military Certificate our Civil Engineering Department offers is called the Military Civil Engineering Certificate."

"This certificate has two classes, A and B, used for military-grade Bionics and military-grade cultivation techniques, respectively."

"What I'm discussing with you now is the certificate for military-grade cultivation techniques..."

According to Director Gao, the Military Civil Engineering Certificate Examination was held every two years, always in October.

The requirements for the Military Certificate were extremely rigorous. Not every examination resulted in anyone passing; if no one met the standards, all candidates would be disqualified.

"The next Military Certificate Examination is next year, which is too soon for you."

"That's why I've planned for you to take the examination after the next one — in October of the year after next, one month after your fifth-year studies begin."

"By then, you should have mastered the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering. After passing the Military Certificate Examination, you can unite the Seven Absolutes and begin cultivating the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power."

Director Gao considered Zhang Yu's plan to pass the Military Certificate Examination in his fifth year and begin cultivating the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to be remarkably fast.

In his projections, at this pace, Zhang Yu could represent the Civil Engineering Department in the Inter-University League by his sixth year and compete for a respectable ranking.

However, upon hearing that he would have to wait until his fifth year to take the Military Certificate Examination before cultivating the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, Zhang Yu felt only one thing... This was far too slow.

Zhang Yu couldn't help but ask, "Couldn't I take it sooner? Like the Military Certificate Examination next year?"

"And then gather the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering even earlier?"

Director Gao raised an eyebrow, sensing that Zhang Yu had become somewhat overly ambitious and self-confident after the competition.

He cautioned, "It's December now. If you want to take the Military Certificate Examination next October, you'll only have ten months to prepare."

"Do you know who else will be taking the exam next year?"

"Su Yanyang and Xiao Yunji, whom you met in the competition, will both be participating."

"Xiao Yunji's Immortal Dao Potential is renowned throughout the Civil Engineering Department. It will be extremely difficult for you to catch up to her in just ten months."

"As for Su Yanyang, although you defeated his competition team, you should know that there's still a significant gap between your individual strengths."

Director Gao reminded him, "Zhang Yu, your talent and aptitude are indeed exceptional, but you mustn't let pride and complacency cloud your judgment."

"Instead of forcing a competition with Xiao Yunji, Su Yanyang, and the others in ten months, why not spend the next three years deepening your mastery of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering? Enhance your foundational data and all other dimensions. When the time is right, you'll soar to new heights."

"The Immortal Dao is a long path. You might think a year or three makes a big difference now, but when you look back fifty years from now, you'll realize it hardly mattered at all."

Zhang Yu knew he couldn't persuade Director Gao on this point.

A new idea struck him. He changed his approach, saying, "Teacher, you're right. I shouldn't be aiming too high too soon. I need to focus on building a solid foundation."

Director Gao nodded in agreement.

Zhang Yu continued, "But surely there's no harm in participating? I don't necessarily need to pass the Military Certificate Examination. I just want to get a feel for it beforehand, to see what the exam is like."

Director Gao considered this. Seeing Zhang Yu's earnest expression, he relented. "Getting some experience wouldn't hurt. Just be careful during the exam. Withdraw immediately if things go south, and don't waste too much money on it."

Zhang Yu immediately agreed, resolving in his heart, "I must pass the Military Certificate Examination by October next year!"

At the same time, Zhang Yu felt a surge of pressure.

He was confident he could surpass Su Yanyang, but surpassing Xiao Yunji in ten months left him uncertain. After all, her strength and Immortal Dao Potential seemed boundless; he still couldn't fathom her limits.

After discussing the Military Certificate Examination schedule, Director Gao shifted to the specifics of Zhang Yu's study and cultivation arrangements.

In Director Gao's view, Zhang Yu possessed exceptional talent in martial dao cultivation, a robust physique, a passion for Civil Engineering, and a dire need for funds.

Therefore, the construction site remained the ideal place for Zhang Yu's cultivation.

At the site, Zhang Yu could cultivate his cultivation art, temper his physique, access subsidized medicines, earn money from projects, and contribute to the department — a win-win situation.

Whenever Director Gao recalled Zhang Yu's performance in the arena — how he had single-mindedly focused on construction amidst the chaos, ultimately completing the required engineering volume before the deadline — he couldn't help but marvel at Zhang Yu's innate Civil Engineering spirit.

Director Gao began, "Starting next month, I'll assign you to some high-value projects. You can cultivate while earning more money."

"Beyond that, what you need most right now is to improve your foundational stats. These are the bedrock of Immortal Dao cultivation. The sooner you reach the Foundation Establishment Limit, the better."

"Here's a Platinum membership card for Hammerheart Pavilion, offering a 50% discount. Use it to temper your dao heart."

Zhang Yu's heart leaped with joy as he received the electronic membership card. With this, he could now access Hammerheart Pavilion's Spirit Realm Services to accelerate his Dao Heart Level advancement.

Director Gao continued, "I've already adjusted the spiritual energy supply to your dormitory to the highest level. Focus on rapidly increasing your Magic Power."

"As for Magic Power Quality, I have several burial grounds in Converging Dragon Garden and have secured a batch of high-quality Corpse Components. From now on, I'll provide you with Magic Power at 200% quality each month."

Zhang Yu naturally remembered the Converging Dragon Garden Magic Power Production Company. He had previously participated in a renovation project at their cemetery.

Hearing about the 200% Magic Power supply, Zhang Yu's heart leaped with joy.

He had previously purchased 175% Magic Power Quality from the Dark Magic Power Realm. Initially, his Magic Power Quality improved rapidly, but as it approached 175%, the progress slowed significantly.

Eventually, after surpassing 175%, he needed to purchase even higher-quality Magic Power to continue improving.

The higher the Magic Power Quality, the more expensive each additional percentage point became, further hindering Zhang Yu's progress due to his financial constraints.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Director Gao truly lives up to his reputation. He even has holdings in Converging Dragon Garden."

Director Gao continued, "As for your physical strength, while working on construction sites will help, we can accelerate your progress."

At this point, Director Gao looked at Zhang Yu and suddenly asked, "Speaking of which, why have you only ever used the Bionic Eye and no other Bionics?"

In Director Gao's view, while Zhang Yu wasn't wealthy, he certainly wasn't so poor that he couldn't afford a single Bionic. Yet, even as a second-year student, he still relied solely on his Bionic Eye.

Zhang Yu explained, "I heard that the highest-grade Bionics are custom-forged using one's own physical body."

"So I want to continue refining my physical body. When I have enough money in the future... I'll get a custom-made Bionic."

"Oh?" Director Gao nodded slightly. "I didn't realize you had such long-term plans."

"Indeed, refining your physical body and obtaining a custom-made Bionic is a more sustainable and potentially more powerful path."

"However, this path is both expensive and difficult. Even many wealthy individuals prefer to skip the slow process of refining their physical bodies and simply acquire powerful Bionics directly."

"Since you've chosen this path, I won't provide you with a Bionic. Instead, I'll find a cultivation-type magical artifact for you. I'll get it to you in a few days."

After bidding farewell to Director Gao, Zhang Yu felt he had gained a great deal from this encounter.

With Director Gao's support, his cultivation journey would undoubtedly accelerate once again.

Zhang Yu, ranked 95th in the Civil Engineering Department's Foundation Establishment Realm, felt the respectful gazes of those around him. Recalling Director Gao's actions earlier that day, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "The learning environment at Myriad Laws University is truly excellent. The teachers are surprisingly compassionate."

Meanwhile, Director Gao contacted True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Director Gao: Magnetic Pole, I want to get Zhang Yu a magical artifact to aid his physical body cultivation.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: You're so good to your disciple.

Director Gao: Where do you recommend buying one?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Lingxiao Intelligent Manufacturing Official Shopping Website.

Director Gao: What's the point if all the money goes to the platform?

Director Gao: I'd rather buy directly from you, without any middlemen taking a cut.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: *Sigh*, fine, since we've been friends for centuries.

Director Gao immediately smiled and replied: Foundation Establishment Stage Limit body refinement efficiency, portable, no side effects, no damage to Immortal Dao Potential, no additional expenses, budget of 5 Spirit Coins. Can you manage that?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Should I just become your disciple instead?

Director Gao: Don't rush. We can negotiate the price.

Myriad Laws University City, 88th Floor.

Zhang Yu began cultivating the seventh martial art of the Martial Dao Holy Body.

During the final showdown of the Civil Engineering Competition against Su Yanyang's team, the Martial Dao Holy Body's First Layer had proven surprisingly effective.

This made Zhang Yu even more eager to master the entire Chain Formation Diagram set.

Especially since he would soon be returning to construction site cultivation, he planned to seize every moment to advance the Martial Dao Holy Body. Greater efficiency at the site would translate to higher earnings.

Beyond cultivating the Martial Dao Holy Body, Zhang Yu also needed to improve his dao heart, Magic Power, Magic Power Quality, and physical strength.

He couldn't neglect his artifact refinement and Civil Engineering courses either.

In the days that followed, Zhang Yu found himself constantly on the move, wishing he had 48 hours a day to balance work, cultivation, and studies.
