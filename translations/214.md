# Chapter 214: This Is the Vibe

The second trial teacher walked into the classroom.

He was a stout man, his muscles bulging like marble.

Elder Wang struck again, unleashing three consecutive palm strikes that forced the stout man back three steps, yet his expression remained unchanged, as steady as a mountain.

Elder Wang commented, "What formidable hard skill! This level of cultivation is impossible to achieve without graduating from a university."

The man smiled faintly. "I am glad you are satisfied, old sir."

"Hello everyone, I am Teacher Yao. You can also call me Little Yao."

"I used to sell legal, addictive drugs, a legitimate business."

"Later, someone told me that if you don't break the law, you'll never strike it rich. I heard the dark world of tutoring paid well, so I joined this profession."

"Only then did I understand that while some things are illegal, their existence is perfectly reasonable..."

The crowd laughed at his words.

Teacher Yao then stripped off his shirt, revealing a back full of needle marks.

Displaying the punctures, some of which were still weeping fluid, Teacher Yao said proudly, "As someone who came from selling drugs, I've always been well-versed in expelling their toxins."

"One look at the number of needle marks on my body and you can guess the number of drugs I've injected."

"The secret to why I can maintain such a healthy state today lies in the technique I am here to teach you all: the Azure Blood Toxin-Clearing Needle."

"The force of this needle technique penetrates deep into the internal organs, expelling the body's drug toxins and residues every day. You will no longer have to worry about the side effects of drugs. You can take them with peace of mind and work overtime without concern."

"Of course, as a former professional, if anyone has questions about drugs or wants to buy some, feel free to ask me. I still have access to certain channels and can get you some discounts..."

In a conference room on the other side, the elders of the Dark Learning Gang listened to Teacher Yao's lecture and all nodded in silent approval.

"Little Yao is not bad. He can sell drugs while teaching, which is why his course revenue has always been among the top."

"Combining lessons with drug sales is the new trend. The key high schools have been doing it for ages; we should keep up."

---

Outside the classroom, Zhang Yu listened to Teacher Yao and thought to himself, _This won't do. I need to give myself another edge._

Zhang Yu thought back to his last trial class at the industrial park.

_These old Qi Refinement geezers who managed to get into university probably all came from key high schools, maybe even the top three._

_When you're out in the world, your identity is what you make it. If I pretend to be from White Dragon, I might be more favored..._

---

"Greetings, everyone. My surname is Bai, and I graduated from White Dragon High School."

The third trial teacher to take the stage was an old man with a youthful complexion and white hair.

With a gentle laugh, this Teacher Bai took Elder Wang's three palm strikes, only taking a slight step back before standing firm.

Elder Wang's eyebrows shot up. "You're also from White Dragon High School? Then we're alumni."

Teacher Bai smiled faintly. "I am 145 years old this year. It's a pleasure, junior. I remember when I was studying at White Dragon High School, it was just a small building, and there were no grade rankings..."

Hearing him casually recount the history of White Dragon High School, Elder Wang was immediately more than half-convinced and nodded slightly. "Greetings, senior."

Teacher Bai smiled and looked at the elderly students in the classroom, speaking slowly.

"As the saying goes, one must learn until old age to live to old age. I'm sure you've all seen plenty of people die in poverty because they didn't have a job."

"When I was as young as you, I was also busy with work day in and day out, signing up for tutoring centers at night to enhance my professional competitiveness."

"After all, how can you work if you don't study? And if you don't work, how can you earn money and live to a ripe old age?"

"Only by persevering in a lifetime of study, work, and paying taxes can our generation walk the true Immortal Dao."

"I am 145 years old now, but I've almost saved enough to buy a life-extending booster. Once I successfully take the booster, I'll be able to live to 170 and work for another ten years..."

Hearing this, the elderly students all applauded in unison, looking at the 145-year-old Teacher Bai as if they were seeing their own role model.

"Hehe, of course, the reason I can live so long and maintain my ability to work is related to my years of persistent cultivation and expelling the toxins from my body..."

---

In the conference room on the other side, the gang elders were also full of praise.

"Old Bai is as steady as ever. He has already built a rapport with the students before even officially starting his lecture."

"With his seniority, qualifications, and his own life as an example, he's more than enough to command the respect of these clients. If this class is given to him, the renewal rate will definitely be high."

"Sigh, both Little Yao and Old Bai are good. I don't know who to choose."

---

Outside the classroom, listening to Old Bai's lecture, Zhang Yu felt a sense of foreboding. _This guy is also playing the White Dragon card?_

_Damn it... I have to think of another advantage._

_These old Qi Refinement geezers are all insufferably arrogant, and they all come from key high schools, maybe even the top three._

_Ordinary methods probably won't be enough to impress them..._

After Teacher Bai's lecture concluded, it was finally Zhang Yu's turn.

The moment Zhang Yu entered the classroom, he heard Elder Wang take the lead and say, "Young man, you can leave. There's no need for you to speak."

Although Zhang Yu's disguised appearance was that of a thirty- or forty-year-old, in the eyes of these old men, he was clearly just a young whelp.

Elder Wang said coldly, "We've decided. We want Senior Bai to teach the class. There's no need for a replacement."

With that, he suddenly thrust out his palm, which carried the sound of wind and thunder as it shot toward Zhang Yu's chest, as if to blast him out of the classroom door in one go.

_Bang!_

A loud explosion rang out.

Elder Wang's palm first struck the copper-armored corpse skin that Zhang Yu had tempered with the Resentful Baleful Art.

Then, the force of the palm was completely stopped by the Formless Cloud-Astral Qi beneath the skin.

Next, as the Formless Cloud-Astral Qi transmitted the force, it was dispersed throughout Zhang Yu's silver-frost-like bones.

Though he appeared not to have moved at all, Zhang Yu had used his flesh and bones, now tempered to the peak of Qi Refinement, along with his force-channeling technique, to withstand the blow head-on.

From Elder Wang's perspective, it felt as though he had slammed his palm into a hundred-times-refined steel rebar used in the foundation of a skyscraper. Not only did he fail to push his opponent back a single step, but his own palm throbbed with a sharp pain.

"You brat!" Elder Wang looked at Zhang Yu, his face a mixture of shock and uncertainty. "Such a powerful body protection cultivation technique, and I'm guessing it's not just one, is it?"

Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "Old sir, there are still two palms to go."

"With your level of body tempering, you must be a university graduate. There's no need for further tests."

He placed his hands behind his back, the palm he had just used trembling with pain, desperately wanting an ice pack.

The other elderly men were secretly astonished by this scene. They all knew Elder Wang's capabilities, so for Zhang Yu to receive such an evaluation from him, their perception of Zhang Yu instantly rose. They immediately quieted down, wanting to hear what this young man's lecture was like.

Zhang Yu walked to the podium and said calmly, "My surname is Ma. You can call me Teacher Ma."

"The Spring and Autumn Endless Zen that I will be teaching you today is a cultivation technique I learned back when I was at Immortal Cloud High."

An old man frowned. "Immortal Cloud High? What kind of school is that? How come I've never heard of it?"

Another old man said, "It sounds a little familiar. Could it be some ordinary high school?"

Elder Wang, however, suddenly shot his head up, his face filled with shock.

"You said Immortal Cloud High? Could it be that..."

"That's right." Zhang Yu said calmly, "The very same Immortal Cloud High on the 1.5th floor of the Immortal Capital."

"I am from the Immortal Capital."

Zhang Yu's words immediately captured the attention of everyone present.

Meeting their gazes, Zhang Yu said calmly, "I live in the North Sixth Ring of the 1.5th floor of the Immortal Capital. And not outside the Sixth Ring, but inside."

Someone whispered, "What's the 1.5th floor?"

Elder Wang said in a low voice, "It is the cloud layer of the Immortal Capital, a city in the sky. But as for the specific location of this North Sixth Ring... that I do not know."

Zhang Yu explained, "Above the Immortal Capital is a floating island that covers the entire city. It is a city in the sky that we generally call the 1.5th floor, situated between Kunxu's 1st and 2nd floors."

"The most beautiful place up there is the Central Cloud Sea Park."

"I still remember the forests in that sea of clouds, the lakes, and the great dragon breathing out clouds and mist..."

As Zhang Yu recalled the various luxurious scenes of the 1.5th floor he had seen during the Dao heart test of his Foundation Establishment exam, a nostalgic look filled his eyes as he described its wonders to the crowd.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _That half-day experience in the illusionary landscape is certainly enough to brag about here in Songyang City._

And the crowd listened, their faces full of longing, as they heard about the various delicacies, bionics, and cauldrons in the mansions by the Cloud Sea Park, wishing they could visit just once in their lifetime.

Elder Wang thought to himself, _What is this person's background? The people from the Immortal Capital I met on the second floor never spoke of things as magnificent as this._

After boasting for a while, Zhang Yu suddenly raised an eyebrow, looked at the crowd, and said, "Frankly, I had absolutely no interest in coming to a rural place like this to tutor a bunch of out-of-towners like you."

He sighed helplessly. "It's just a shame that the heavens are unpredictable and fortunes can change overnight. I can only do myself this small injustice..."

Sensing the three parts contempt, three parts disdain, three parts scorn, and one final part arrogance in Zhang Yu's eyes, Elder Wang's body trembled as he cried out internally, _This is the feeling._

_The people from the Immortal Capital I met on the second floor, they're all just like this, with their noses in the air. This is the exact vibe they give off when they speak to us people from Songyang!_

While imitating the Immortal Capital gentleman he had seen in the Foundation Establishment exam, Zhang Yu secretly observed the changes in the crowd's expressions, thinking to himself, _It's just as I thought._

_The more these old workhorses despise those with a high school education and those they deem beneath them, the more they worship wealthy, high-achieving prodigies like the gentlemen from the Immortal Capital._

---

In the conference room.

The gang elders were pleasantly surprised. "An Immortal Capital gentleman came to teach at our place? Is he for real?"

An old man with a long white beard said, "Real or not, didn't you see how well the clients are reacting?"

Another bald elder laughed. "Excellent, just excellent! This is what we need! This is what our Dark Learning Gang should be doing! The Immortal Capital brand, imagine how many new students that could attract."

A supporter of Teacher Yao said, "But Little Yao can drive drug sales. He said he wants to open up a new market for the gang. If he becomes a golden teacher, he can help us secure drug distribution channels."

The long-bearded elder retorted, "And you believe everything he says? I could say I can get the rights to Immortal Resonance Group's content."

Another person said, "What about Old Bai? A genuine White Dragon graduate, 145 years old, experienced, and completely dedicated to the gang..."

The bald elder said, "He's a 145-year-old fossil. He could drop dead in class for all we know. Why choose him?"

He continued, "I say we just choose this Ma Yunteng. The Immortal Capital brand is famous enough to truly help the gang."

Another person proposed, "I still think Little Yao is better. A famous brand is nothing compared to making more money."

Someone said, "Little Yao has his good points, and Little Ma has his. Why don't we just select two golden teachers this time?"

Someone else countered, "There are only so many classes. If we choose two... where are we going to find enough classes for them to teach?"

The elders in the entire conference room began to argue, squabbling over who should become the new golden teacher to take over this class.
