# Chapter 127: Great Sun Circulation, A Successful House Hunt

Hearing Bai Zhenzhen's curious question, Zhang Yu recounted the events with Le Mulan and her potion-sweat.

He concluded with a helpless tone, "I don't know if there are any side effects from this potion Le Mulan sweats out. I just hope the tutoring fees I earn will cover any future medical bills."

Bai Zhenzhen's eyes, however, were sparkling. "You're saying her sweat can restore stamina, excite the nerves, and stimulate magic power? And according to her, it can also heal injuries?"

"That's a damn panacea, isn't it?"

"Bring some back for me next time. Let me try it. I have high drug resistance; I'm not afraid of side effects."

Zhang Yu realized that even though he had been in Kunxu for some time, he still felt like a fish out of water in many ways.

For instance, the idea of collecting a rich person's sweat—even if he tried to steel himself, he just couldn't bring himself to do it.

Seeing Zhang Yu remain silent, Bai Zhenzhen said, "Then ask Le Mulan when she's going to hire both of us for sparring. Didn't she say during the athletics meet that she'd consider it?"

Since Zhang Yu was unwilling, Bai Zhenzhen figured she could just collect the sweat herself when the time came.

Zhang Yu replied casually, "She said she needs to adapt more before she can take on both of us at once. I have no idea what she needs to adapt to."

"I alone was enough to make her break out in a full-body sweat. How could she possibly adapt to fight both of us at the same time?"

As he spoke, Zhang Yu's gaze swept over Bai Zhenzhen's calves, over the skin exposed to the air. He noticed that the scars from the martial arts tournament had all disappeared.

Seeing the smooth, porcelain-like skin, Zhang Yu smiled. "Zhen, you got rid of your scars successfully? Now you won't have to worry about them splitting open when you go all out."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded with a smile, rolling up her sleeve to show the newly repaired skin on her arm.

"How's it look? I think it's pretty good, basically the same as my old skin."

Zhang Yu was about to comment on the fair, soft-looking skin when he suddenly noticed a Xinchuang Medical logo and asked in confusion, "What's this?"

Bai Zhenzhen said nonchalantly, "It's a surgical implant ad. You either have to be a gold member of the hospital to get rid of it, or pay an extra two thousand."

"I'm not wasting my money on that. My metabolism is fast enough; this thing will be gone in a few weeks anyway."

Zhang Yu nodded in agreement. There was no need to pay to remove an ad that would disappear on its own soon.

Zhang Yu then asked, "How much was it? I'll transfer you the money, reimburse you."

Bai Zhenzhen showed him the electronic bill. "After a promotional discount, the quote was 38,888. They also threw in a free physical check-up."

After transferring the money to Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu's savings dropped to just over one hundred and seventy thousand, making him lament how quickly money was spent.

Bai Zhenzhen, on the other hand, let out a cheer and hugged Zhang Yu from behind. "Your reward, Yu-boy."

Feeling the True Spiritual Root enter his dantian and spiritual energy rush in from all directions, Zhang Yu couldn't help but hum in comfort.

Bai Zhenzhen ran to the side and said, "You cultivate for a bit. I'll be ready to go once I finish my disguise."

Bai Zhenzhen began to put on a wig, temporary tattoos, padding, and other items, preparing for her part-time job in the dark world of tutoring.

With the spiritual root inside him, Zhang Yu once again activated the Great Sun Qi Sea.

At first, nothing happened, but after a moment, he felt the True Spiritual Root begin to adapt to the Great Sun Qi Sea technique, vaguely assisting him in absorbing the light.

However, after just one breathing cycle, Bai Zhenzhen had finished her disguise. Zhang Yu would have to wait until they reached the industrial park to further test the True Spiritual Root's assistance with the Great Sun Qi Sea.

...

Three hours passed in a flash.

By the small lake in the industrial park.

The lights from the office buildings, the moonlight cascading from the sky, and the nearby streetlights—wisps of light were being continuously absorbed by Zhang Yu, the spiritual energy within them refined into magic power.

The Great Sun Qi Sea had already been advanced by Zhang Yu to Level 2 (11/20).

At this moment, not a single trace of light could be seen on his body. On the contrary, he appeared even dimmer in the darkness of the night.

And under the influence of the True Spiritual Root, this dimness gradually expanded from his skin to a radius of several dozen centimeters around him, as if he were shrouded in an invisible shadow.

_As expected,_ Zhang Yu thought, _the True Spiritual Root is indeed adapting to the new technique, helping me improve the efficiency of absorbing light and gathering spiritual energy._

Fu Ji, witnessing this, was even more impressed. "Bai Zhenzhen's evolutionary spiritual root is too useful. It can continuously adapt and evolve according to the user's cultivation technique and direction. It's practically an all-purpose spiritual root."

"Right now, the root has already improved the absorption efficiency of the Great Sun Qi Sea by at least ten percent. If it continues to adapt, I wonder how high the improvement will reach."

At the same time, a flicker of curiosity arose within her. "This root is currently at the level of a Heavenly Spiritual Root. In the future, could it evolve into a Divine Spiritual Root... or even an Immortal Spiritual Root?"

Fu Ji couldn't be sure, but her curiosity grew.

After all, above the Heavenly Spiritual Root was the military-grade Divine Spiritual Root, and above that was the Immortal Spiritual Root, exclusively supplied to the Ten Great Sects.

_If Bai Zhenzhen's spiritual root could evolve to the Immortal Spiritual Root level,_ Fu Ji mused, _it would be a heaven-defying fortune... but also a heaven-defying disaster._

...

An entire night passed.

Facing the morning sun, Zhang Yu carried Bai Zhenzhen on his back, running from the suburbs toward the city.

By now, Zhang Yu had advanced the Great Sun Qi Sea to Level 3 (14/30). Even without intentionally circulating the technique, the passive absorption was running on its own.

And Zhang Yu estimated that the passive absorption effect at Level 3 was about thirty percent of the active absorption.

He figured this technique was probably like the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method; once it reached Level 10, there would be little difference between the passive and active effects.

At this moment, as the morning sun rose, Zhang Yu felt the wisps of sunlight being fiercely funneled into his body like sparks. Accompanied by the ceaseless circulation of his Great Sun magic power, the light was continuously drawn into his dantian and ultimately refined into his own magic power.

As the morning sun grew brighter, Zhang Yu felt the Great Sun Qi Sea within him operate with increasing ferocity.

The golden Great Sun magic power carried waves of heat, coursing through his body like streams of fire, crazily craving and devouring the sunlight he absorbed.

Zhang Yu felt his dantian had become a small furnace, which, like adding fuel to a fire, burned brighter and brighter with the absorption of light, continuously producing an ever-denser Great Sun magic power.

But Zhang Yu felt no discomfort; instead, it was like basking in the sun in winter, a pleasantly warm feeling.

He thought to himself that the Great Sun Qi Sea was indeed much more effective to practice during the day; the efficiency was worlds apart from last night.

From Zhang Yu's back, Bai Zhenzhen said in surprise, "Yu-boy, you're getting darker and darker."

As the Great Sun Qi Sea circulated fiercely, Zhang Yu's entire person seemed to be enveloped in a layer of shadow, making him appear several shades darker than before.

Zhang Yu quickly looked at his body and immediately realized it too.

_Damn! Am I turning black?_

He thought to himself that it was a good thing he was in Kunxu; otherwise, in another place, wouldn't using this technique get him shot on a daily basis?

However, the Great Sun Qi Sea contained a method to eliminate such phenomena. With a thought from Zhang Yu, he slightly smoothed out the Great Sun magic power, reducing the passive absorption effect a little, and the shadow on his body vanished instantly.

Bai Zhenzhen asked curiously, "If your Great Sun Qi Sea keeps leveling up and its light absorption gets stronger, will you eventually become completely pitch black? Could you use that to hide your identity?"

"In the future, when you turn black, you can try to see if you can evade fares, dodge surveillance, and even steal or rob..."

_Zhen, you're... you're getting more and more out of line! Who told you that turning black makes it easier to commit crimes?_

Zhang Yu was about to reprimand her loudly when Bai Zhenzhen added, "Ah, forget it. It feels like doing all that won't make as much money as underground tutoring, and you'd have to figure out how to pay taxes on your own. Too much trouble."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu couldn't help but reflect that the tax system was definitely a major factor in maintaining public order in Kunxu.

On the way back to the city, Zhang Yu's phone vibrated. He opened it to see a message from Yu Xinghan.

Yu Xinghan: You're looking to rent a place?

Zhang Yu's interest was piqued. He must have seen his social media post about renting.

Considering he was a Golden Core disciple, who knew how much wealth he controlled? He probably had a vacant apartment to rent out.

So, Zhang Yu immediately replied: Yes.

Yu Xinghan: The place I'm renting is a bit big. Want to be roommates?

Zhang Yu frowned and replied: A Golden Core disciple still rents?

Yu Xinghan: Never buying a house is a principle upheld by my master's lineage. It's better to invest in yourself than to spend money on a house.

Zhang Yu thought to himself that this True Monarch Xinghuo was truly a destitute Golden Core. A dignified Golden Core True Monarch couldn't even afford a house in Songyang City on the first layer of Kunxu. It was a good thing he hadn't joined his sect back then.

But when he asked about the rent and was told it was over a hundred thousand a month, Zhang Yu felt he had been presumptuous.

So Zhang Yu replied: I don't like having roommates.

He thought that by rejecting Yu Xinghan, their conversation would end there.

Unexpectedly, the other party sent another link from a shopping platform.

Yu Xinghan: Go in and help me click this.

Zhang Yu was momentarily stunned. He looked at it carefully and was speechless.

_Well, I'll be damned. It's one of those 'slash the price' promotions from a Kunxu shopping site._

_Isn't this Yu Xinghan guy a Golden Core disciple? He needs to stoop to this level for such a small gain?_

Zhang Yu couldn't be bothered to reply.

Over the rest of the day, Zhang Yu continued to receive more messages about renting.

While he was on the rooftop, absorbing the sun and cultivating the Great Sun Qi Sea, he received a message from Qian Shen.

It was a small apartment of over 20 square meters under his father's name, with a monthly rent of 6,000.

Zhang Yu was slightly tempted, as this price was definitely a bargain in the city center—a friendship price from Qian Shen.

While eating in the cafeteria, Zhang Yu received a message from Song Hailong.

He sent photos of the room directly. It looked much larger than Qian Shen's 20-square-meter apartment, had great lighting, and even a large balcony outside, perfect for him to practice the Great Sun Qi Sea.

The only thing was, there were a lot of washing machines. Why were there four in the room?

When Zhang Yu asked, Song Hailong replied: I'm not done sending the photos yet. This is just the nanny's room.

After seeing the subsequent photos of the entire 200-square-meter house and the rental price of over 100,000, Zhang Yu silently replied: Too spacious, I don't like it.

On the rooftop after school, Zhang Yu received a rental message from Le Mulan.

He opened the photos of the apartment. Hmm… no bed, no sofa, no kitchen, and certainly no TV or anything of the sort. There was a medicine cabinet, a meditation room, body tempering equipment, and a washing machine...

The size was about 60 square meters, and with the standard Immortal Dao decor, it perfectly met the needs of both Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

It was just the "Quick-Quick Clean" disinfection spray from Purple Cloud Pharmacy at the entrance that Zhang Yu felt would take some getting used to.

And the fact that the 60-square-meter apartment had two bathrooms also struck Zhang Yu as strange.

Le Mulan: This apartment is across the street from Purple Cloud High School. It's a place I used for a while. You only need to pay 2,000 a month.

Le Mulan: However, if you move in, our future sparring sessions will be held here.

Le Mulan: After all, changing and washing up at school is not very convenient.

Le Mulan: Oh, right, this apartment has two bathrooms. One of them is for my exclusive use; you can't enter it.

Zhang Yu did a quick calculation. Le Mulan's private bathroom was about 30 square meters, taking up half the apartment's area.

Zhang Yu cursed inwardly. _So, this apartment's main feature is your private, off-campus bathroom, isn't it? Just how many dedicated toilets do you need? Are you trying to claim territory everywhere?_

Zhang Yu: No problem. I'll rent this apartment.

Looking at the rental information he received today, Zhang Yu felt he had made a new discovery.

Although the factions behind Yu Xinghan, Song Hailong, and Le Mulan... all these super-rich people... were probably very wealthy.

But he had a feeling... that Le Mulan had far fewer reservations when it came to spending money.

Just then, Bai Zhenzhen, from the other side of the rooftop, said, "Yu-boy, it's about time. We should head to White Dragon."

Today was the day for their combat training with Yu Xinghan and Song Hailong at White Dragon High School.

At the thought of sparring with a Golden Core disciple, a hint of anticipation appeared in Zhang Yu's eyes.
