# Chapter 609: Kuang Tianqing, Enjoy This Show

True Monarch Tranquility watched the battle unfold on the live stream, inwardly musing, "Zhang Yu is actually taking the initiative against Kuang Tianqing? Is he trying to get more screen time?"

"A bold move, but incredibly dangerous."

True Monarch Tranquility knew that if Zhang Yu performed well enough to stall Kuang Tianqing — even for a short time — he could still earn considerable praise and generate massive buzz, even if heavily injured.

"This is the advantage of the underdog. Against an opponent like Kuang Tianqing, any outcome short of a complete rout can be considered a victory."

"Conversely, for an academic overachiever like Kuang Tianqing, anything less than a swift victory against a weaker opponent could damage their reputation."

"However... the stakes are equally high for Zhang Yu."

True Monarch Tranquility knew that if Zhang Yu suffered not just defeat but humiliation at Kuang Tianqing's hands — being forced to kneel, branded with humiliating marks, implanted with a Demonic Fetus by Corpse Demons or monsterfolk cultivators, or worse — he would become a laughingstock, a joke on today's battlefield.

"The students of Heavenly Demon University are notorious for enhancing their own popularity and suppressing their opponents' Immortal Dao potential by humiliating and toying with them."

"Conversely, the humiliated party, while gaining massive attention and 'dirty' publicity, becomes nothing more than fodder for sharp-tongued media outlets to exploit mercilessly. They earn nothing themselves, their reputations are utterly ruined, and their path in the Immortal Dao becomes virtually impossible."

Meanwhile, countless viewers watching the live stream shared similar thoughts with True Monarch Tranquility.

In their eyes, Zhang Yu's fate could only be one of two outcomes:

A crushing defeat!

Or a crushing defeat accompanied by brutal humiliation!

Director Gao, watching the live feed, felt a pang of anxiety, as if the carefully nurtured seedling he had tended for so long was about to be ravaged by a violent storm.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole received a notification from her artifact spirit and frowned as she watched Kuang Tianqing and Zhang Yu on the screen. "What are Dao Qiankun and the others playing at? How did it come to this — Zhang Yu facing Kuang Tianqing?"

At the construction site, Yu Xinghan, massaging Shi Huaiyu's shoulders, grew tense, his hands unconsciously increasing their pressure.

Simultaneously, it wasn't just the countless viewers watching the live broadcast who learned that Zhang Yu was about to fight Kuang Tianqing.

Nine Heavens Liu, currently locked in a fierce battle with students from the Finance Department, frowned as he watched the video feed transmitted to his Bionic Eye.

"Zhang Yu is fighting Kuang Tianqing?" Nine Heavens Liu thought, a flicker of doubt crossing his mind. "How much did that kid get paid to risk his life like this?"

The video Nine Heavens Liu was watching was the very one Zhang Yu had posted in the Four-School Group chat.

Zhang Yu: I've found Kuang Tianqing! [Video Link]

Ye Xingli immediately messaged Zhang Yu: Escape to my position! Don't worry about the prisoners.

To the students in the Four-School Group, Zhang Yu was already a dead man. They merely marked his location and began speculating about Kuang Tianqing's next move.

Meanwhile, those directly facing Kuang Tianqing on the front lines... were not just Zhang Yu.

Zhao Tianxing felt the terrifying pressure emanating from Kuang Tianqing, his mind blank with sheer terror.

"I... I'm just a Junior College Student. How did I end up here? Why am I fighting the strongest opponent in the ten universities?"

Hu Yuntao felt his thoughts race wildly, then slow to a crawl, as if the world itself had become surreal.

"Don't panic! Let's... let's... Fucking give it everything we've got!"

Sensing the tense atmosphere, Zhang Yu calmly gazed at Kuang Tianqing before him and said, "I've been waiting for an opportunity, searching for your weakness, seeking a domain... where I can defeat you..."

Before Zhang Yu could elaborate, Kuang Tianqing transformed into a blur of motion and shot directly toward him like a bolt of lightning.

The two clashed violently, like a pair of colliding meteorites, and a fierce battle erupted with a thunderous roar.

"Hmph, trying to get more airtime during the livestream?" Kuang Tianqing sneered inwardly. "Why should I give you extra screen time?"

Beyond this vanity, Kuang Tianqing knew that Dao Qiankun and other opponents could arrive at any moment. She needed to eliminate Zhang Yu as quickly as possible.

Zhang Yu cursed inwardly, "This bastard! He just spouted a bunch of arrogant nonsense, but when it's my turn, he cuts me off? Is he really that afraid of someone stealing his viewers?"

Zhang Yu refused to let Kuang Tianqing dictate the rhythm of the battle. He knew that their clash was a struggle for dominance over the rhythm of the fight.

Moreover, since this battle involved absorbing the opponent's popularity and online buzz, verbal exchanges were essential.

In many cases, what they said mattered even more than the fighting itself.

As Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing clashed fiercely, they simultaneously projected lines of text into the air using Spirit Realm Techniques, leaving trails of luminous words hanging in the air like ethereal banners.

"Kuang Tianqing, you weave through the battlefield using Illusion Arts, controlling its rhythm. You not only maximize the potential of every ally but also manipulate your opponents' tempo, attempting to bring everything under your command."

"But to achieve this, you've mobilized every force on the battlefield."

"As a result, in the brief moments to come, you'll have no one to rely on but yourself... This is your weakest moment."

As he spoke, Zhang Yu's body suddenly erupted in raging flames, his flesh and blood seemingly consumed by the blaze.

Watching Zhang Yu envelop himself in the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, shielding his humanoid shell, Kuang Tianqing thought to herself, "Hmph, using the Heavenly Sun Radiance God as armor?"

"But why isn't my Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique working?"

Kuang Tianqing knew her Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique operated through spiritual energy. Whether targeting human bodies, Bionics, or magical artifacts, it could distort their senses and trap them in illusions.

"Unless there's no spiritual energy to contact."

"But to ensure the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique's effectiveness, I contaminated the Spirit Veins long ago."

In Kuang Tianqing's eyes, the massive fortress beneath her feet was merely a useless cage. The converging Spirit Veins made it even easier to contaminate, ensuring all her opponents would fall victim to her illusions.

"Stopping your breathing technique during combat is too late. You were already ensnared by my Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique before the battle even began."

Kuang Tianqing knew this was the terrifying aspect of the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique's current internal testing version. Spreading through spiritual energy, it was nearly impossible to defend against, far beyond simply halting your breathing technique during battle.

However, Kuang Tianqing understood that after this exposure, others would likely soon deduce the role of Spirit Veins, realizing her Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique could operate through them. This would diminish her informational advantage.

"This Immortal Scum hasn't fallen under the Illusion Art. The only explanation... is that he's been continuously refining Magic Power by burning matter."

The Heavenly Sun Radiance God's profile flashed through Kuang Tianqing's mind as she continued to ponder: "He has a far more efficient Spirit Vein available, yet he insists on using puppets to burn matter for Magic Power."

"This means this Immortal Scum has been on guard against me for the past two days, determined to avoid even the slightest chance of succumbing to my illusion."

At this thought, Kuang Tianqing couldn't help but scoff.

Such excessive caution and vigilance only disgusted her.

"Guarding against me? You've spent so long guarding against me?"

"Do you really think you stand a chance against me?"

The Heavenly Demon Void Technique transformed Kuang Tianqing into a phantom, allowing her to effortlessly evade her opponent's attacks.

Activating the Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art, she devoured Zhang Yu's attacks like a black hole, then returned the Eternal Sun Radiance Flame from the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

Enhanced by these two cultivation arts, Zhang Yu's every offensive seemed to dissolve with ease, rendering Kuang Tianqing invincible.

The battle had only just begun, yet they had already exchanged dozens of blows in a mere instant, their minds racing through countless lightning-fast calculations.

But in that first fleeting moment of engagement, the surrounding earth and walls shuddered violently and began to shift.

Kuang Tianqing's thoughts raced. "The walls are moving on their own? My Heavenly Demon Banner should have suppressed all the surrounding equipment. How was the Magic Power Circuit activated?"

Zhang Yu coldly retorted, "Kuang Tianqing, are you wondering why this place has been activated?"

"Because I knew from the start that even with a formation to enhance them, I couldn't dominate this complex battlefield using Spirit Realm Techniques alone."

"So, within this prison, I abandoned information technology and adopted purely mechanical power, using the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to activate it and reshape the terrain..."

At that moment, layers of heavy armor and walls surged toward Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing's position, like wave after wave of mudslides, threatening to completely bury and trap them.

What Zhang Yu didn't mention was that, to reinforce the structures near the prisoner confinement area, he had performed blood sacrifices using Bionics and ashes from the captives, greatly enhancing the buildings' structural integrity.

As for why the enemy prisoners possessed ashes?

Whose body doesn't produce ashes eventually?

Moreover, with the activation of the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon, spiritual light pulsed through the Magic Power Circuits within the walls, transforming them into vast arrays of temporary magical artifacts, elevating their defensive capabilities by another tier.

Zhang Yu said coldly, "Kuang Tianqing, you are now trapped."

A buzzing vibration filled the air.

Kuang Tianqing narrowed her eyes, spotting numerous holes piercing the walls.

In the next instant, a torrent of black light erupted from the holes, revealing a swarm of flying swords, each emerging in rapid succession.

At nearly every moment, hundreds of flying swords poured forth.

The Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power erupted with thunderous force. Driven by Zhang Yu, it hurled the torrential swarm of flying swords toward Kuang Tianqing with brutal ferocity.

Zhang Yu roared, "Kuang Tianqing, savor the Myriad Swords Formation I've forged for you!"

Each flying sword now surging forth had been created by Zhang Yu after devouring massive quantities of metallic materials.

The long, slender blades he named "flying swords" were now being deployed to form the Myriad Swords Formation. The spherical ones he called "sword pills" awaited later use.

Zhang Yu had forged a staggering ten thousand of these long, slender flying swords!

Though technically called "flying swords," they were merely simple sword-shaped blades, their strength significantly enhanced through his meticulous refinement.

However, with the activation of the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon, each blade temporarily transformed into a magical artifact. Propelled by the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power at blinding speed, they briefly wielded the true might of flying swords.

"Kuang Tianqing, I'll shatter your Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art with sheer numbers and material might!"
