# Chapter 651: New Reincarnation System

The 10 Spirit Coin price for a Golden Core made Zhang Yu feel the strong support Myriad Laws University was giving him.

The Heavenly Meteor Core Shattering Scripture's cultivation art also made Zhang Yu feel that his chances of victory had further increased.

As Zhang Yu's gaze swept over the projections of the Golden Cores, he realized that these cores were indeed designed specifically for shattering. Each core lacked any mention of the benefits of using them to advance to the Golden Core Realm, focusing solely on the effects after self-destruction or shattering.

Some, upon shattering, would trigger spiritual energy, creating natural disasters.

Others, after shattering, would temporarily enhance the physical body, surpassing even the physical body of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Still others would summon lightning, unleash sword qi, or even cause the physical body to self-destruct...

The variety of effects was astonishing, leaving Zhang Yu in awe.

However, what truly caught Zhang Yu's attention was the Golden Core capable of multiple shatterings.

"Ten-Shattered Golden Core."

"One Golden Core, ten shatterings."

As Zhang Yu read the description, he thought, "This Golden Core was originally designed to assist cultivators in breaking through to the Golden Core Realm. It allows them to attempt the breakthrough again even after failure, increasing their chances of success."

"However, as Foundation Establishment cultivators' skills improved, breaking through to the Golden Core Realm became increasingly straightforward. This technology, originally designed for failure recovery, gradually fell into disuse."

"But who could have imagined that this very technology would later find its true brilliance in the realm of Shattered Golden Cores?"

Zhang Yu valued the Ten-Shattered Golden Core not for its raw power, but because he planned to shatter it multiple times to cultivate the Heavenly Meteor Core Shattering Scripture.

Just then, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution continued, "Remember, according to the Ancient Method, these Golden Cores are classified from Ninth-Grade to First-Grade. Shattering and reforming them requires different levels of cultivation."

"Of course, by modern standards, you'll need a different Golden Core Score to control each grade of Golden Core."

"Before you choose, run a score for yourself, just in case."

"No need for precision or revealing too much personal information — a rough estimate will suffice."

"If you're short on funds, contact True Monarch Tranquility for a loan arrangement."

"As for the physical damage from shattering your core, I'll arrange a medical team for you..."

As soon as Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution finished speaking, he ended the call.

When Zhang Yu regained consciousness, his mind had already returned to his body aboard the Flying Boat.

He immediately ordered a dozen Ten-Shattered Golden Cores, then opened the Golden Core Direct Guidance app to check his Golden Core Score.

Despite revealing only a portion of his true strength, Zhang Yu's score skyrocketed, propelling him to second place on the Golden Core Seed Rankings.

Seeing Kuang Tianqing at the top, Zhang Yu thought, "Kuang Tianqing already has over 800,000 points? But this probably isn't her full potential. Her actual score might already exceed a million."

After casually posting his latest score on his social media, Zhang Yu headed to Dao Qiankun's Spirit Hall.

This was the place he had chosen to cultivate the Heavenly Meteor Core Shattering Scripture.

Clearly, beyond practicing the cultivation art, he also intended to unravel the mysteries surrounding Brother Dao and replicate Dao Qiankun's Dao Seed.

As Zhang Yu began visiting Dao Qiankun's Spirit Hall daily, cultivating while keeping vigil over the corpse, many couldn't help but sigh in admiration.

Ye Xingli mused, "My Junior Brother truly cherishes old bonds. Even after Dao Qiankun has been dead for so long, he still cares so deeply?"

Inside the Spirit Hall, faint golden light flickered within Zhang Yu's body, accompanied by muffled thuds that emanated from within, carrying an aura of destruction.

*Bang!*

His body trembled slightly as he exhaled a wisp of white smoke. Glancing at the data on his Feather Book, he murmured to himself, "Not bad."

Heavenly Meteor Core Shattering Scripture Level 1 (5/10)

Zhang Yu mentally calculated his resources. "With my current savings and the advertising revenue from the upcoming final battle, I should have enough to cultivate this art," he thought. "If not, I can always take out another loan from the school."

"As for the physical strain, it's still within manageable limits."

Zhang Yu's physique was already exceptionally robust, and with the school's medical team on standby daily, he could fully devote himself to cultivating the Heavenly Meteor Core Shattering Scripture.

His gaze then shifted to Dao Qiankun's corpse lying before him.

He split his consciousness, continuing to cultivate the core shattering technique with one part while pondering the matter of Dao Qiankun's corpse with the other.

Days passed in this manner, bringing the final battle ever closer.

Heavenly Demon University's headquarters.

Kuang Tianqing gritted her teeth, a sharp pain twisting her heart.

"It's happening again..."

She rubbed her temples incessantly, fighting the urge to tear open her skull and purge her mind of all memories.

The ancient memories stirred within her, fueling her rage and sorrow, driving her to obliterate everything before her.

But soon, as streams of magic power flowed into her body, her spirit gradually calmed.

Divine Monarch Unrestrained, the principal of Heavenly Demon University, was using Immortal Dao Technology to seal the memories in Kuang Tianqing's mind.

"Tianqing, I'm going to seal all the memories triggered by the Reincarnation Group. This will prevent them from interfering with your ability to fight."

"However, some memories may still surface during this period. You must guard your dao heart and resist their influence at all costs."

Kuang Tianqing nodded slightly. In the next moment, a series of images flashed before her eyes, like a fleeting glimpse of ancient scenes: battlefields, crumbling cities, and faces both familiar and alien.

The battle between good and evil... the war between humans and monsters... the reform of the sects...

Fragments of shattered memories surfaced in Kuang Tianqing's mind, sending a chill down her spine.

"Why?"

"Why has the world become like this?"

But in the next moment, even more memories flooded her consciousness, catching her completely off guard.

"Wait, where are all these ancient memories coming from? Has the Reincarnation Group made another move?"

Amidst her shock, Kuang Tianqing suddenly saw the scene from weeks ago when Divine Monarch Unrestrained had sealed her memories.

Then came the image from years earlier, when her memories had been sealed again.

And finally, ten years ago... the very first time her memories had been sealed.

"My memories have been sealed before?"

"Each time Divine Monarch Unrestrained sealed my memories, he first undid the original seal and then added a new one."

"That's why I can see my past sealed memories now."

"This Ten Greats League isn't the first time the Reincarnation Group has tried to tamper with my memories. No... it isn't..."

As the memories surged more violently and their content grew richer, a realization gradually dawned on Kuang Tianqing: "So that's how it is."

"I was reincarnated from within the sect."

"In my previous life, I lived for thousands of years, a true ancient being."

In her mind, she seemed to still remember how, after her reincarnation, she struggled to accept Kunxu's rapid development.

The ancient memories became a burden, hindering her progress on the Immortal Dao.

Thus, she sought out Divine Monarch Unrestrained, who sealed her memories, allowing her to cultivate a personality more suited to the new era.

"Senior, you've remembered?" Divine Monarch Unrestrained's voice echoed. "Recently, the Reincarnation Group has been interfering, repeatedly triggering your memories and breaching my seals. I need to reestablish the seals and reinforce them."

Kuang Tianqing nodded slightly, watching the scenes from her memories resurface — deeper truths, secrets hidden even from the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, dark corners of her past that had been obscured. She remembered everything.

"So I was... a member of the Heavenly Demon Sect?" she thought to herself.

"My son sent me down to undergo reincarnation and tribulation."

"And the real reason I came here was..."

A cold smile crept across Kuang Tianqing's lips. "The new Reincarnation System... Heh, no wonder they sealed my memories."

"I wasn't here for some worthless Longevity Technology."

"I came to promote the new Reincarnation System. What a brilliant deception."

After a long silence, when Kuang Tianqing's gaze finally cleared, she took a deep breath and said, "Thank you, Master. I feel much better now."

Divine Monarch Unrestrained replied, "Tianqing, until the final battle, these ancient memories will no longer trouble you."

"Give it your all, defeat Zhang Yu, and claim the championship."

Kuang Tianqing nodded. "Rest assured, Master. I will definitely secure the Eternal Spring Sutra and extend the lifespans of all the Soul Transformation cultivators."

Inside the Spirit Hall, Zhang Yu began experimenting after noticing anomalies in Dao Qiankun's Bionic.

He tried repairing the Bionic and even replacing it with a new one, but either his efforts proved futile or the artifact spirit intervened.

Gazing at the spirit, Zhang Yu suddenly had an idea. He explained his plan to repair the Bionic.

To his surprise, the artifact spirit immediately summoned a repair service to fix the corpse's Bionic.

Zhang Yu stared in disbelief. "Does this artifact spirit have its own account? Can it spend money to maintain Dao Qiankun's corpse?"

"And that claim about elevating the physical body to a perfect state..."

Zhang Yu scanned Dao Qiankun's Bionic, purchased the relevant blueprints, and submitted them to the artifact spirit.

The spirit shook its head slightly. "Not what I require."

Zhang Yu's eyes lit up. "What kind do you need?"

The artifact spirit rattled off a list of requirements, which Zhang Yu meticulously recorded. He then began modifying the Bionic blueprints using the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology.

A question arose in his mind: "Did Brother Dao leave this artifact spirit to modify his own Bionic?"

"And is the reason his physical body never reached perfection because of problems with the Bionic?"

As he submitted each modified blueprint, Zhang Yu felt himself growing closer to the Dao Seed within Dao Qiankun's corpse.

Day after day, he cultivated the Heavenly Meteor Core Shattering Scripture and submitted blueprints to the artifact spirit, time slipping by unnoticed.

The night before the finals.

"I've done everything I can," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "Tomorrow's battle... I'm confident of victory, but..."

Just then, Zhang Yu's gaze flickered as a message from Zhang Pianpian appeared before him.

"Sister must be on the third floor by now," Zhang Yu mused. "Is this a cross-floor message?"

Zhang Pianpian: Junior Brother, I was thrilled to hear you made it to the finals, but I'm also deeply worried.

Zhang Pianpian: This battle will be far more dangerous than any you've faced before, but I know you won't give up.

Zhang Pianpian: I have only one piece of advice for you.

Zhang Pianpian: If you win, consider choosing the Immortal Sect Technique, the Nine Heavens Reincarnation Steps. Its self-preservation capabilities are unparalleled. With your talent, you can master it quickly and ensure your safety.

Zhang Yu replied: I understand.

"Nine Heavens Reincarnation Steps, huh?" Zhang Yu sighed inwardly. "Another option to consider."

Meanwhile, the company group chat was buzzing with excitement. The Soul Cultivators under Zhang Yu's command were eagerly anticipating the final battle tomorrow.

Their excitement surged even higher after Zhang Yu distributed red envelopes.

Zhao Tianxing said: Boss, have you heard? There's an Immortal Sect Technique that allows Soul Cultivators to cultivate all the way to the Immortal realm!

Zhao Tianxing: If you choose this cultivation art, every Soul Cultivator in the world will be able to ascend to the pinnacle of the Immortal Dao. From now on, no one in this world will fear death again.

Zhang Yu had countless times yearned to change the world, but when the opportunity to do so — even just a possibility — was placed before him, he felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility.

Director Gao: Zhang Yu, how's your preparation going?

Seeing Director Gao's message, Zhang Yu pondered for a moment before replying: Teacher, I'm... scared.

Zhang Yu: I don't know what to choose.

Director Gao: The era of Kunxu marches relentlessly forward, with each year bringing sweeping reforms to the Immortal Dao.

Director Gao: Even I, immersed in this tide, often feel hesitant and confused, wondering if this path is truly the right one.

Director Gao: But the times wait for no one, not for you or me. Regardless of our choices, the world will continue to advance.

Director Gao: In this world, nothing remains unchanged. The path of the Immortal Dao is especially fraught with trials and tribulations, demanding unwavering progress.

Director Gao: Zhang Yu, move forward. Don't look back.

Reading Director Gao's reply, Zhang Yu took a deep breath and murmured, "Move forward..."

"A-Zhen, let's go."

Zhang Yu stepped forward, longsword in hand, his gaze fixed on Kuang Tianqing in the finals arena. An unprecedented battle intent surged within him.

Kuang Tianqing, ranked first on the Golden Core Seed Rankings, had absorbed the essence of countless academic overachievers. As the strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator aided by eight great Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, she was considered invincible within her realm by the entire world. She herself believed no other Foundation Establishment cultivator could stand against her.

Zhang Yu, supported by multiple military-grade Powers, propelled by the Feather Book, Chain Formation Diagram, and Dao Seed, and wielding Bai Zhenzhen, also believed he had reached the pinnacle of the Foundation Establishment Realm. With the help of his companions and teachers, he was confident that no Foundation Establishment student in the world could surpass him.

Now, in this moment, to prove their strength, to forge their own paths on the Immortal Dao, and to determine the future of Kunxu, they had only one goal. Only one objective could satisfy them, give them meaning:

To utterly defeat, crush, and annihilate the opponent before them!
