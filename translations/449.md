# Chapter 449: Golden River University's Unique Teaching Methods

The Flying Boat touched down at Golden River University with a gentle shudder.

Zhang Yu disembarked and looked at the University City before him. "Where to next?"

Xiao Qingxuan remained silent.

Beside them, Xiao Yunji also said nothing, her eyes glinting as she made last-minute adjustments to her online lecture.

Su Yanyang checked the university map. "We have six hours until the competition. Should we wander around, find a place to rest, or warm up?"

Shi Huaiyu said, "What's the point in warming up for a match at Golden River University? Let's just find a place to wait. I still have today's studies to complete!"

At that moment, a tall man covered in blue-purple markings spoke up. "I've been to Golden River University several times. There's a perfect spot near the competition venue to pass the time!"

Zhang Yu turned to look at the speaker. This was Li Zhen, Mo Shangjin's former teammate and now their companion for the Civil Engineering League.

Hearing Li Zhen's words, Zhang Yu turned to look at Mo Shangjin's projection nearby!

Though Mo Shangjin's physical body remained under treatment, his consciousness manifested through the Spirit Realm, hovering beside the group as their competition guide.

"Very well," Mo Shangjin declared. "Follow Li Zhen."

Zhang Yu nodded. "Understood. Please lead the way, Senior Brother!"

Moments later, Li Zhen shared the destination coordinates. The group blurred into motion, leaving afterimages as they accelerated through University City.

Golden River University's main thoroughfares teemed with cultivators in rapid transit, though trucks occasionally interrupted the flow along the secondary roads.

Zhang Yu surmised this stemmed from Golden River's sprawling campus and relatively lower cultivation standards compared to top-tier institutions like Myriad Laws University. Physical transportation still dominated for heavy cargo.

This was still the realm of the 36 Upper Colleges, after all — not the vocational college Zhang Yu had visited during his project, where impoverished students and academic underachievers dominated the roads.

As they advanced, Zhang Yu spotted a roadblock ahead. Officials were conducting some form of inspection, causing the convoy to stall in the congested street.

Witnessing this scene, Li Zhen slowed slightly but showed no intention of joining the queue!

As he activated his Foundation Establishment Domain, the crowd erupted in commotion!

A dense stream of Gang Qi surged forth from Li Zhen's body, instantly dividing the crowd in two. He forced his way through the throng, leading Zhang Yu and the others toward the checkpoint. The surrounding onlookers gazed at the rankings displayed above Zhang Yu's group, their faces contorted with equal parts shock and fear!

"Those are Foundation Establishment students from Myriad Laws University."

"All top-ranked from the Civil Engineering Department!"

"So wealthy! Their Bionics are all premium brands — Myriad Laws students sure have deep pockets!"

"Why is that one using an Extreme Tiger Bionic?"

"Rich people's tastes are hard to figure out!"

"Wait, he's got a 10,000 Spirit Coin debt?"

When Zhang Yu reached the checkpoint, he saw individuals lining up to present their Yin Artifacts, Yang Artifacts, or both for inspection by Intelligent Artifact Spirits.

A staff member examined one person and asked, "Why do you have traces of Intelligent Artifact Spirit here?"

"I don't know! I can't afford any Intelligence Artifacts!"

"Then please cooperate with the investigation!"

Meanwhile, on the other side, a student removed his pants and said, "I didn't bring my Yin Artifact. To avoid inspections lately, I've been keeping it locked at home!"

The staff member checked briefly and nodded. "Alright, you may proceed!"

Observing the inspection line, Su Yanyang sighed, "There are far too many students at Golden River University who keep Bionic implants in their private areas!"

Xiao Qingxuan remarked, "Considering Golden River University's distinctive education in Civil Engineering and Dual Cultivation, it's understandable that such practices would be prevalent!"

Zhang Yu glanced at the person being taken away, shouting their innocence, and asked, "Isn't the Anti-Intelligence Artifact going overboard with its effects?"

Mo Shangjin stroked his chin thoughtfully. "It is rather extreme. Perhaps... they're using this opportunity to track down those escaped High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts?"

Zhang Yu looked surprised. "Track down escaped High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts? You mean those artifact spirits that fled from Joyful Union University might be hiding in other people's Yin or Yang Artifacts?"

Mo Shangjin speculated, "These are artifact spirits refined by Divine Monarch Jade Nectar. Even though they managed to escape this time, it's highly unlikely that they weren't left with some form of restriction!"

"Perhaps they can only function through Yin and Yang Artifacts? Maybe they're hiding in some student's Yin Artifact!"

A scene suddenly flashed through Zhang Yu's mind: Immortal Dao: Starting from Finding a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch's Yin Artifact

He thought to himself, Could someone truly rise through a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch's Yin Artifact?

But in the next moment, he shook his head, thinking Kunxu would never witness such a miraculous occurrence!

As they spoke, they were about to pass through the checkpoint inspection!

Li Zhen, walking at the forefront, noticed several inspectors looking their way and immediately enlarged the text on his head!

"It's the Lord of Myriad Laws."

"Should we kneel?"

"Team Leader, should we inspect them?"

"Inspect? You dare inspect a Ten Greats' Yin and Yang Artifacts as an Upper College Student? How dare you!"

Seeing the rankings above their heads, along with the Myriad Laws University name and the subsequent numbers, the inspectors felt an overwhelming pressure bearing down on them. Their hearts trembled, and they dared not move a muscle, simply watching helplessly as Zhang Yu's group departed!

As they raced toward their destination, Zhang Yu suddenly saw ghostly figures materialize before him, wailing with bitter anguish:

"I'm doomed! Jade Nectar Coins crashed! Watching my body sold piece by piece, dying bit by bit!"

"Entire family perished — seven Soul Cultivators in one lineage. Hatred burns eternal!"

"Why? Why did I die in the frenzy? I never even bought the coins! You cruel heavens, where's your justice?"

Watching these spectral figures scream resentment through his Bionic Eye, Zhang Yu raised an eyebrow. "What kind of ad is this? Funeral home nearby? Holding a memorial service?"

Having lived in Kunxu for years and attended university for so long, Zhang Yu wasn't surprised by these ghostly advertisements.

Mo Shangjin suggested, "It's probably Golden River University's job fair!"

The words "job fair" still startled Zhang Yu. "What kind of job fair?"

Mo Shangjin explained, "Many died in the 3rd-tier Financial Storm. This created a sudden influx of Soul Cultivators at Golden River University, disrupting the original supply-demand balance!"

"To help students repay their debts and ease employment pressures, Golden River University's job fair even made special arrangements for Soul Cultivators. Truly befitting of the Thirty-Six Upper Colleges — how humane!"

Lady Fortune scoffed, "Humane my ass! More like they've got plenty of dead souls owing them money. If they don't get these corpses working posthumously, the debts will go bad!"

Mo Shangjin continued, "Look at these pitiful resumes — they're all exaggerating their first death experiences, aren't they? After all, that first job after death is crucial!"

In the next moment, Zhang Yu spotted a crowd of people moving through a nearby square. Many Upper College students were lined up at recruitment booths!

Mo Shangjin pointed at one company's booth. "See that Avīci Corporation? They're a subsidiary of Heavenly Demon University, specializing in Soul Cultivation Business! The Anti-Intelligence Artifact's activities might well be backed by them!"

Zhang Yu thought to himself, So Heavenly Demon University's shadow looms behind the Anti-Intelligence Artifact too. This must connect to Joyful Union University's search for the Intelligence Artifact. The waters run deep here!

Just then, a loud shout erupted from the recruitment site... "This Daoist Lord has succeeded!"

A Yang Artifact leaped up before the recruitment booth, emitting wild cries of triumph!

A teacher nearby led the applause, saying, "Let's congratulate this student for finding work on the spot and signing the contract!"

---

Outside the Health Club, Zhang Yu asked, "Is this the place?"

Li Zhen replied, "The Spirit Realm Network here is free. Plus, whether you're looking for pre-match massages or rooms for cultivation, it's all very convenient and reasonably priced!"

As Zhang Yu's group entered the Health Club, the eyes of many technicians lit up, eager to serve these Foundation Establishment students from Myriad Laws University!

Soon after, numerous students from Golden River University also arrived upon hearing the news, even offering free services just for a chance at Dual Cultivation!

"This is a brand-new Yin Artifact from Yin-Yang Heavenly Dao, still 80% pristine. Check out its quality, feel its texture, and test the magic power connection..."

"I'm an Elite Upper College Student. This is my participation experience in Willpower Competitions..."

"Everyone, here's my dual cultivation records and credentials. You can review them..."

As Zhang Yu observed the swarm of self-recommending Upper College Students surrounding him, a hint of exasperation flashed in his eyes. Damn, just as expected from a dual cultivation and civil engineering specialty university — every single one looks like they've got civil engineering written all over their faces!

At that moment, a text projection materialized in his Bionic Eye. Someone had marked one student's head with the warning: "This person is a transfer student — do not trust!"

Su Yanyang and the others who witnessed this promptly added their own remarks. After all, could a transfer student ever be trustworthy? Better to blacklist them first and ask questions later!

In an instant, the student's image blurred in Su Yanyang's view, leaving only the three-word remark: "Transfer student — do not trust!"

In the end, Su Yanyang and Li Zhen departed with several Golden River University Upper College Students, leaving behind the envious gazes of the remaining applicants.

As they walked away, Su Yanyang turned to the students beside him. "This really doesn't cost anything?"

"I'll tell you, I'm not spending a single cent," one of the Upper College Students declared. Zhang Yu turned to ask, "Is it wise to do this before the competition?" Mo Shangjin replied, "Dual Cultivation professionals have their unique expertise. When mastered, their earnings far surpass what we make at construction sites! These Upper College Students may not match Su Yanyang and the others' cultivation level, but they're skilled enough. Cultivating together benefits both sides!"

"It's only because we arrived hastily. For major events, such Upper Colleges would normally assign us eight or ten Dual Cultivation partners. They'd be eager to advance alongside us!"

In the time that followed, Zhang Yu seized every moment at the club to refine his Fingertip Earth to Gold technique.

The Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering all belong to the Inverted Kunlun set within the Chain Formation Diagram!

If I cultivate Fingertip Earth to Gold to Level 20, I'll have six techniques at that level within Inverted Kunlun. That's enough to activate the first layer's effect!

With this realization, Zhang Yu's anticipation surged. He devoted himself completely to mastering Fingertip Earth to Gold!
