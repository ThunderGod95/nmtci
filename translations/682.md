# Chapter 682: World-Piercing Cone Repaired, Nascent Soul Refined

Kunxu Third Layer.

The expeditionary force composed of the Ten Great Universities had gathered, passing through the Grand Void opened by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole in waves to reach the Kunxu Third Layer. They immediately began constructing defensive fortifications around the Grand Void.

Yu Xinghan was among the ranks, a Civil Engineering student participating in both frontline construction and combat.

Ahead of the Civil Engineering students, Tu Lishan addressed them: "The essence of warfare, much like Civil Engineering, lies in the concept of transportation."

"In Civil Engineering, we transport our own resources to the target location."

"But in war... we transport the enemy's resources to our own territory."

"War isn't about how many you kill or how much you destroy. It's about how much you can bring back."

"Look at those academic overachievers from the Security Department. No matter how skilled they are in combat, they always end up getting dismissed. They know how to fight, but they don't know how to transport. In the end, they achieve nothing."

"Some security captains have passed down their positions for four or five generations, but the lineage ended with him. He has truly failed his ancestors."

"Therefore, you must all remember these essential war strategies..."

Yu Xinghan glanced at Zhang Yu's grayed-out avatar in his Bionic Eye, silently wondering, "Zhang Yu... where exactly did you go?"

For the past two weeks, he had been unable to contact Zhang Yu. He had even discovered that Zhang Yu's company had been handed over to Ye Xingli's management.

According to Yu Xinghan's information, the company hadn't sent any funds to Zhang Yu in a long time.

"Is someone suppressing Zhang Yu?"

Yu Xinghan shook his head, feeling as if the entire situation was shrouded in a dense fog, obscuring the truth.

Yu Xinghan could only send one message to Zhang Yu: "Are you there?"

Yu Xinghan: [10 Spirit Coins]

Yu Xinghan: "If you need help, just tell me directly."

Yu Xinghan: "I'm online 24/7 now."

On the battlefield, scorched by waves of Thunderfire, Kuang Tianqing's figure flickered in and out of sight as he relentlessly pierced through various daoist arts attacks, charging toward the research institute ahead.

After the Ten Great Universities organized an expedition to the Kunxu Third Layer, Kuang Tianqing immediately signed up.

He simply couldn't bear to remain on the Second Layer, especially within the territories controlled by the Heavenly Demon, Netherworld, Joyous Union, and White Bone Universities.

He felt that even if he stepped outside and encountered a dog demon, it might try to have its way with him.

"In my past life, when I had no memories, I would stop at nothing to cultivate," he thought.

Thus, he came to the Third Layer, hoping to start anew.

"At least there won't be so much messy nonsense on the battlefield," Kuang Tianqing mused inwardly.

Just then, a group of students from Celestial Monsters University arrived as reinforcements.

Ying Mingchi, the strongest undergraduate at Celestial Monsters University, glanced at Kuang Tianqing and immediately sent a message: "Got time?"

When Kuang Tianqing didn't reply, Ying Mingchi couldn't help but suspect the other man was prejudiced against monsterfolk. "Why are the Four Heavenly Demon Schools fine, but not Celestial Monsters University?"

Ying Mingchi followed up: "Do you think there's a big difference between humans and monsters?"

"Look around you. Are many of these people truly human? I see no difference between them and dogs, cows, or horses."

Kuang Tianqing: "I think there's a big difference between men and women."

Ying Mingchi paused, looking at Kuang Tianqing, currently in his male form, and asked, puzzled: "Is there?"

Outside a newly captured laboratory on the Kunxu Third Layer, Bai Zhenzhen, Wen Wuya, and other students from Heavenly Sword University sat together, reviewing the Slaying Manual issued by the school.

The teacher at the front spoke up: "Your internship grades for this semester will be based on your killing performance over the next two weeks.

"I've noticed that many of you still focus on attacking your opponents' weaknesses, prioritizing victory in combat and the destructive power of your sword techniques. In your pursuit of victory, you're neglecting the actual profits from battle.

"Let me remind you: we're here on the Third Layer not to kill, but to make money.

"What's the difference? The difference is enormous.

"Those Junior College Students and Lower College Students might resort to any means to defeat us, using any dirty trick to win, without considering the consequences.

"Can we, the Students of the Top Ten, stoop to such tactics?"

"Remember, during combat, prioritize attacking the least valuable parts of your opponents' bodies. Preserve the valuable parts to maximize profits after the battle."

"This Slaying Manual details the market prices for various body parts of Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, and Golden Core cultivators, as well as the market values of common Bionics. Study it thoroughly and memorize it by tomorrow."

Bai Zhenzhen casually flipped through the Slaying Manual, and Zhang Yu's gray avatar materialized in her Bionic Eye.

"Yu Zi..."

Though Zhang Yu had been out of contact for over a month, Bai Zhenzhen still remembered his last words.

"I believe in you, but I still want to help you," she thought to herself.

She sent him a message:

Bai Zhenzhen: "50 Spirit Coins"

Bai Zhenzhen: "I've been making good money killing people lately."

Bai Zhenzhen: "Take this and use it."

Bai Zhenzhen: "Study hard. Money comes easy here."

On the other side of the Third Layer battlefield, Tian Shengong of Immortal Armaments University was preparing to collect the spoils of war when a notification appeared in his Bionic Eye.

"Combat Recorder?"

Tian Shengong cursed inwardly, "From now on, whenever we come to the Third Layer, we have to keep the Combat Recorder running 24/7? Recording every piece of loot for the Soul Cultivators to calculate taxes?"

"Isn't this just distrusting us, assuming we'll steal things?"

Despite his grumbling, Tian Shengong activated the Combat Recorder as instructed.

But just as he was about to begin gathering the battlefield's resources, he felt an overwhelming force descend from the sky.

A giant dragon soared across the battlefield, and all the scattered materials rose into the air, surging toward the swirling mist beneath the dragon's claws.

Tian Shengong stared in shock. "Divine Monarch Great Devourer of Celestial Monsters University?"

"She's stealing our loot?"

"A Soul Transformation Realm expert stealing things from Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators?!"

Though Tian Shengong was far away, the Mother Dragon still heard his words, a disdainful smirk spreading across her face.

"Nonsense. How much energy do you think it takes for me to come to the Third Layer? I'm not leaving empty-handed."

Glancing at the weight capacity display in her Bionic Eye, which showed 298.8% full, Divine Monarch Great Devourer's dragon eyes swept the horizon. She immediately decided to add more to her burden.

"With my strength, I can handle three times the weight limit. I'll take more."

Spotting a group of Qi Refining students scavenging in the distance, she extended a dragon claw and snatched up all the trash they were collecting.

---

"Make money! Make money! Make money!"

"Get rich! Get rich! Get rich!"

Watching the Junior Brothers and Sisters before her, their morale soaring, Shi Huaiyu nodded inwardly.

The Second Layer had gradually become unprofitable due to the war, and fighting might even lead to losses, so everyone avoided conflict.

But now, as more people made money on the Expedition to the Third Layer, the number of volunteers for war had surged. Students from the Ten Great Universities eagerly signed up, eager to legally plunder.

Shi Huaiyu reminded the students before her, "Remember, after killing and looting, don't forget to pay your taxes. War Tax, Plunder Tax, Life-Risk Tax — missing even one will result in massive fines, leaving you with no money left to plunder."

One student couldn't help but ask, "We have to pay taxes even for risking our lives? And aren't the Righteous Gods gone?"

Shi Huaiyu replied coldly, "With the Righteous Gods gone, the school is now collecting these taxes on their behalf."

Moments later, after finishing her communication with the students, Shi Huaiyu glanced at Zhang Yu's name in her contacts list again.

"Zhang Yu hasn't been seen for two months," she thought to herself. "Could those rumors be true? Did the principal steal Zhang Yu's Immortal Sect Technique and suppress him, keeping him hidden away?"

Shi Huaiyu sighed, recalling Zhang Yu's words about going into seclusion for a while.

In the end, she decided to trust him.

Shi Huaiyu: [5 Spirit Coins]

Shi Huaiyu: "Zhang Yu, focus on your cultivation. We're waiting for you to return."

Vajra University.

Divine Monarch Greenwood, who had been waiting in the reception room for several hours, sensed movement and knew the person he had been waiting for had finally arrived.

"Divine Monarch Wisdom Foundation."

Looking at the divine light before him, Divine Monarch Greenwood smiled faintly. "You've made me search high and low for you."

Divine Monarch Wisdom Foundation replied coolly, "Greenwood, I told you I have no time to waste on crafting Nascent Souls. Even if you begged me for another ten years, it wouldn't change anything."

Divine Monarch Greenwood chuckled bitterly and bowed slightly. "Please, Zhipan, just do me this favor. Consider it a personal favor."

"What personal favor do you deserve?" Divine Monarch Wisdom Foundation retorted coldly. "If it weren't for Magnetic Pole, do you think I would even bother meeting you? Even Magnetic Pole herself has little energy left to waste on such trivial matters these days."

Divine Monarch Greenwood maintained his smile. "The materials and fees are all prepared. Consider this a debt I owe you. If you ever need anything in the future, just ask."

"There are plenty of people who can craft Nascent Souls," Divine Monarch Wisdom Foundation said. "Why insist on having a Soul Transformation expert handle this?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood sighed. "You're the top Nascent Soul crafting master among the Ten Universities. Naturally, I want the strongest Nascent Soul I can find."

Divine Monarch Wisdom Foundation said, "Greenwood, I'm growing increasingly curious... Who exactly is trying to break through to the Nascent Soul Realm that would make you lower yourself like this?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood: "Then I'll take that as a yes?"

Divine Monarch Wisdom Foundation: "After it's done, you'll owe me three favors, to be performed free of charge."

On the battlefield of Kunxu's Third Layer, Li Xuelian casually smoothed her long, silver hair as it fluttered in the wind. She glanced at True Person Starfire, who sat nearby on the ground, having recently advanced to the Nascent Soul Realm and now known as True Monarch Starfire.

"Dad," Li Xuelian said, "there seems to be a problem ahead."

True Monarch Starfire gazed at the fortress ahead, which radiated layers of distorted spatial ripples. "Yes," he replied, "it's a Spatial Lockdown."

He sighed. "The enemy has begun fortifying their defenses, deploying Spatial Lockdowns around all their strongholds."

"No wonder they've been retreating and abandoning vast territories for the past three months. They were likely waiting for a breakthrough in Immortal Dao Technology."

"If the Ten Greats' assault teams can't crack this, we'll soon find ourselves on the back foot again."

---

As the war raged on, the Ten Great Universities and the Righteous Qi Alliance relentlessly advanced their respective technologies.

Whether it was the reconstruction and management of the Spirit Realm, the flourishing development of the Dark Spirit Realm, or the rapid advancement of techniques for killing enemies and seizing treasures, all efforts were focused on annihilating their opponents and securing greater profits from the war.

Among the many technologies being pushed forward, those related to Spatial Lockdown were clearly the most critical.

When the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Layers were isolated by Spatial Lockdown, and when the Moon in the Second Layer was protected by Spatial Lockdown, the Ten Great Universities found themselves at a disadvantage, suffering repeated setbacks in both morale and strategic positioning.

However, when Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole shattered the Sun and Moon and punched a massive hole through the Spatial Barrier between the Second and Third Layers, the situation reversed dramatically. Waves of Ten Universities' expeditionary forces to the Third Layer reaped substantial profits.

Now, with the latest advancements in Immortal Dao Technology, the war's dynamics had shifted once again.

The Third Layer's landscape was now dotted with an increasing number of research institutes, laboratories, and strongholds, each surrounded by Spatial Barriers.

These Spatial Barriers greatly enhanced the defensive capabilities of the Righteous Qi Alliance's strongholds. They were like a series of stubborn nails, driven firmly into the earth.

---

Within the Spirit Realm's spatial domain, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus of Heavenly Demon University scoffed. "Every time we breach an enemy stronghold, it drains vast resources. We're losing more with each battle. How can we possibly sustain this war?"

Divine Monarch Bloodfall nodded in agreement. "If we don't resolve the Spatial Barrier issue soon, our combat space will be gradually compressed. We'll be forced to retreat from our current territories, eventually even from the Third Layer back to the Second Layer... If we keep retreating like this, we might as well withdraw to our respective universities."

As the Soul Transformation cultivators from the Ten Great Universities voiced their concerns, their gazes subtly converged on Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Magnetic Pole, acutely aware of their attention, remained silent, as if she hadn't heard a word.

Meanwhile, her mind replayed scenes from the past four months.

When she first shattered the Spatial Lockdown between the Second and Third Layers, the Soul Transformation cultivators from all the universities had treated her with utmost respect. When she proposed repairing the World-Piercing Cone, though some harbored private reservations, none dared voice opposition.

But as time passed, calls began to circulate within the Spirit Realm urging Magnetic Pole to share her Spatial Technology. This would allow the universities to launch multi-pronged assaults on the Third Layer, rather than relying solely on the Grand Void for entry and exit.

Two months passed, and the voices in the Spirit Realm grew louder. Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs began visiting, subtly and not-so-subtly mentioning Spatial Technology.

A month ago, Soul Transformation cultivators started proposing the sharing of Spatial Technology at every meeting. Though Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole directly rejected these proposals, she could sense the growing discontent among the Soul Transformation cultivators.

Now, with the Righteous Qi Alliance's Spatial Technology spreading, the Soul Transformation cultivators' dissatisfaction had reached a new peak. Today's meeting began with a barrage of attacks against Magnetic Pole.

As the Divine Monarchs spoke in the Spirit Realm's Space, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole didn't even lift an eyelid. She merely said calmly, "The World-Piercing Cone is still under repair. Once the magical artifact is fixed, I will begin breaking through the various Spatial Barriers."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus roared, "Magnetic Pole! You've been saying that for four months!"

Divine Monarch Bloodfall said, "The battle situation is critical. How much longer must we wait?"

Divine Monarch Great Devourer murmured, "How many people are losing money every day? If this continues, I fear all Ten Greats will go bankrupt."

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets of Immortal Armaments University chimed in, "Magnetic Pole, losing some money is a minor matter, but this battle concerns the safety of all our universities and the future of billions of lives. We can't afford to delay."

Looking at Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets, the former director of Immortal Armaments University's Artifact Refinement Department, who had been involved in over two thousand copyright disputes in just three years and was known as one of the university's "Kings of Plagiarism," Magnetic Pole couldn't help but laugh.

"Billions of lives?" Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole scoffed. "Don't make me laugh, Thousand Puppets. I bet you're just waiting to copy my World-Piercing Cone, aren't you? Even if I let you copy it, would you even understand it?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole abruptly stood, and nine Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagodas blazed to life behind her, forming a great formation that suppressed the Spirit Realm space before them.

The Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs present felt their hearts leap.

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus thought to herself, "This woman stored so many Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagodas in the Third Layer? And she can even form a great formation with them..."

"Billions of lives..." Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said coldly. "If you're so anxious, go ahead and panic. I couldn't care less."

"I said the World-Piercing Cone is under repair, and that's that."

"Whether you believe me or not is none of my business."

"At worst, I'll withdraw Myriad Laws University and leave the Third Layer for you all to fight over."

The Soul Transformation Divine Monarch from Vajra University advised, "Magnetic Pole, we certainly believe you. But the situation is tense, and everyone's anxious."

"Could you give us an estimate? How much longer will it take?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole waved her wide sleeves and turned to leave. "Soon. At most, another month or two. Just wait."

Watching her retreating figure, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets from Immortal Armaments University fumed, "Did you see her attitude?! You'd think she single-handedly conquered the Third Layer!"

The meeting dissolved in discord. The assembled Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs exchanged glances, their dissatisfaction growing.

As Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole departed, she thought to herself, "It's a good thing I took the blame."

"If they had known Zhang Yu broke through the Spatial Barrier, they would have been borrowing him for every battlefield these past few months, leaving him no time to advance."

"But..."

Looking toward the Grand Void, she mused, "The Righteous Qi Alliance has been gathering strength for so long. They're likely preparing a major counteroffensive."

"The pressure will only intensify in the coming month."

---

On the Third Layer battlefield, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter glared at the enemy stronghold before him, his heart burning with rage.

Seeing so many enemies hiding behind the Spatial Barrier, yet being unable to strike them, only intensified his frustration.

"These turtle shells... To break through, we're forced to use the narrow main gate."

"Meanwhile, they can attack from every angle and direction."

"They strike, then retreat behind their defenses..."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter circled the stronghold like a lion circling its prey.

"We used to capture a stronghold in a few hours. Now, even I... couldn't take one in days."

"The resources, time, and Magic Power wasted... it's all too much."

Just then, the sky began to darken.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter looked up and saw a dense darkness descending like an abyss, engulfing the entire stronghold and its Spatial Barrier.

"Azure Void... Divine Monarch." True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter watched Divine Monarch Azure Void descend from the sky, unleashing the North Sea Star-Devouring Art. He gritted his teeth, a flicker of resentment in his eyes.

A sour thought crossed his mind: "What's so impressive? He just broke through and is already drowning in debt. He's still poorer than me, a Nascent Soul cultivator."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter knew that as the war dragged on, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had finally issued her last Incarnation Permit, allowing Divine Monarch Azure Void to advance to the Soul Transformation Realm.

However, according to True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's information, the requirements for this Soul Transformation were exceptionally stringent.

Not only did Divine Monarch Azure Void have to purchase all the resources for his breakthrough himself, but Myriad Laws University would provide no further support. He would need to venture into the Third Layer to seize any additional supplies.

As a result, Azure Void was already burdened with a massive debt upon his breakthrough.

Yet... despite these harsh conditions, if True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter had been given the choice, he would have accepted without hesitation.

Now, as Divine Monarch Azure Void unleashed the Immortal Sect Technique, he felt an unprecedented surge of power coursing through him, making him nearly invincible on the battlefield.

His sudden appearance quickly drew the attention of the enemy's Soul Transformation cultivators, and a fierce battle erupted, engulfing thousands of miles.

Divine Monarch Azure Void sneered, "Trash! So what if you broke through a year before me? Today, I'll still crush you."

---

On the other side of the battlefield, Yu Xinghan could sense the Ten Great Universities' tactics growing increasingly aggressive as the war turned against them.

He watched as individuals were herded into the battlefield slaughterhouse jointly established by Heavenly Demon University and Netherworld University, only to be butchered alive and transformed into various corpse components.

Some of these components were dumped into Netherworld University's Blood Pool, others were used to construct defensive fortifications, and still others were further processed into magical artifacts for students to wield in battle.

Yu Xinghan knew that while these individuals were labeled as prisoners of war, some were not.

He even suspected that if the war continued to deteriorate, the Four Heavenly Demon Schools' actions might become even more extreme.

After all, he had recently overheard Heavenly Demon University students discussing proposals from their higher-ups: mass-producing "human farms" to breed prefabricated humans with a three-month lifespan, unleashing Earthly Fiend Qi, and employing tactics that would cause irreversible damage and permanent pollution to the Third Layer.

Glancing at Zhang Yu's still-grayed-out avatar in his communication log, Yu Xinghan thought to himself, "It's been four months already..."

In the next moment, a notification from his superiors appeared in his bionic eye.

"Building defensive fortifications, are we?" Yu Xinghan mused. "If they're building fortifications, should we do the same?"

In the days that followed, the Third Layer's landscape became a jagged network of interlocking defensive lines, each side constructing massive fortifications that devoured countless resources and reduced wealth to ashes, like grinding machines.

---

Above Myriad Laws University, a Thunderfire suddenly descended from the sky.

With a deafening roar, ear-piercing alarms blared across the entire university campus.

Le Mulan looked up in astonishment. "Didn't we break through to the Third Layer already? Why is there an air raid here?"

Myriad Laws University wasn't the only target, the territories of all Ten Great Universities on the Second Layer were under attack simultaneously.

A massive force of Righteous Qi Alliance cultivators had breached the Spatial Lockdown on the Second and Third Layers, launching assaults on the rear lines of the Ten Great Universities.

Throughout this chaos, the Auspicious God observed the movements of each university over the following days.

He finally confirmed his suspicions.

"As expected, the Magnetic Pole lacks the power to break through the Spatial Lockdown any further. She can only passively endure the air raids."

"Hmph, all our preparations to guard against her before launching the full-scale assault were for naught."

"If we'd known this, we should have attacked long ago."

At that moment, the Auspicious God's gaze flickered as he received a message from a believer.

"Oh? Finally found a lead on Zhang Yu?"

Meanwhile, within a nearly undetectable, inaccessible, and almost unknown space within Myriad Laws University, Zhang Yu's eyes slowly opened. An aura characteristic of the Nascent Soul Realm gradually emanated from his body.
