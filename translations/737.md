# Chapter 737: Ten Billion to Mend the Heavens

Even after securing funding from the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts, Zhang Yu didn't stop. Instead, he set his sights on the Righteous Qi Alliance.

"The Ten Universities have already contributed money and effort," Zhang Yu thought. "The Righteous Qi Alliance can't just sit back and reap the benefits."

A map of the entire Kunxu Fifth Layer materialized in Zhang Yu's bionic eyes, dotted with numerous coordinates.

Zhang Pianpian's voice followed. "I've searched through all video records on the divine power network from the past year and pinpointed the approximate locations where the Righteous Qi Alliance's Soul Transformation experts store their Immortal Dao resources."

Zhang Yu shared the map and coordinates with Bai Zhenzhen beside him. "A-Zhen, let's go raid some homes together."

"Raid whose homes?" Bai Zhenzhen asked.

"The homes of those Soul Transformation experts from the Righteous Qi Alliance," Zhang Yu replied.

Hearing his answer, Bai Zhenzhen was first stunned, then overwhelmed with ecstatic joy. "Our family's going to be rich again!" she thought gleefully. "We can finally make up for the money we blew last time!"

She burst out laughing. "Dad! I absolutely love you!"

Holding hands, the two streaked across the sky, leaving a long white trail behind them. In the blink of an eye, they arrived at a Righteous Qi Alliance stronghold.

A surge of Extreme Emotion Sword Qi swept down, dismantling the entire building's defenses.

Next, Zhang Yu unleashed the power of his Immortal Descendant bloodline, breaking through restrictions one after another. In moments, they reached the storage area where a Righteous Qi Alliance Soul Transformation expert kept their supplies.

Their relentless advance left no one capable of standing against them. Enemies either knelt in surrender or scattered in retreat.

After all, with Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's combined combat strength, they were unstoppable against anyone outside the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs in the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation. This was precisely why Zhang Yu had chosen to act with Bai Zhenzhen.

Potions, magical artifacts, bionic components, medicinal herbs, and various raw materials... Gazing at the dazzling array of supplies in the warehouse, Bai Zhenzhen gasped. "These Righteous Qi Alliance Soul Transformation experts have hoarded so much?"

She casually picked up a potion. "Isn't this for the Qi Refining Stage? A Soul Transformation expert is hoarding even this? They'd rather let it sit here than give it to the Qi Refinement students outside?"

Zhang Yu released a flying sword, which began scanning and cataloging all the supplies. He then contacted his company to arrange for their collection.

When Bai Zhenzhen heard Zhang Yu planned to sell these assets to pay future workers' wages, her joyful expression from the raid vanished. "All of it?! You're going to pay it all out as wages?!"

Zhang Yu nodded. "We'll sell what we can. If we can't, we'll distribute the supplies directly as payment."

"According to Teacher and Senior Sister's calculations, to halt the Heaven Collapse, the Outer Formation must be expanded to cover the entire Fifth Layer."

"To complete such a massive project in a short time, we need to mobilize as many people as possible."

"No amount of money is too much."

Hearing this, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but ask, "So how much money do we need?"

Zhang Yu thought for a moment. "Our company's funds, plus the investments from the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts, plus all the assets we can seize from the Righteous Qi Alliance... once we pour all that in, it should be just about enough."

*Thump!*

Zhang Yu's words struck Bai Zhenzhen like a sledgehammer to the chest. Her head roared.

"Pour it all in?!" Bai Zhenzhen exclaimed in disbelief. "So all this effort raiding and seizing assets... doesn't that just mean we're giving away the Soul Transformation experts' money to others?"

Seeing Zhang Yu nod, Bai Zhenzhen said bitterly, "Yu Zi, shouldn't we at least keep a little for ourselves?"

Zhang Yu took a deep breath. "A-Zhen, it pains me too. But if I take a little for myself, and you take a little for yourself, the people below us will follow our lead. Soon, everyone will be taking their cut. No matter how many Spirit Coins we have, how much would be left?"

"This is a matter of life and death. We can always earn more money later. The priority is for everyone to survive."

A short while later, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen had already breached three more strongholds.

As each supply depot fell, Bai Zhenzhen watched vast quantities of resources being transported away, none of which she could touch. Tears welled up and streamed down her face.

Sobbing, she asked, "Yu Zi, how much money are we going to spend?"

Zhang Yu replied calmly, "Probably over ten billion Spirit Coins."

Bai Zhenzhen's hand, gripping her sword, trembled uncontrollably. Finally, she took a deep breath and managed to say, "Son, I can feel your determination. Go all out. If we end up broke... at worst, we'll just earn it all back together later."

As they raided more and more strongholds, Bai Zhenzhen's feelings gradually shifted from resentment, heartache, and sorrow to numbness.

Meanwhile, the Qingtian Sword Spirit within her sword had initially been skeptical of Zhang Yu's words. "In this era, can someone like that really exist?" she thought. "Is this kid Zhang Yu just putting on a show, pretending to spend the money, only to secretly pocket Bai Zhenzhen's share?"

From the Sword Spirit's perspective, it was far more likely for a modern Kunxu person to devise schemes to swindle their companions than to actually "spend a fortune to give everyone in the world triple pay."

But as she continued to observe, she slowly realized that Zhang Yu truly intended to spend every last coin. A sense of shock began to wash over her.

"This is insane."

Even in ancient times, the Qingtian Sword Spirit had never seen anyone throw away their entire fortune like this.

"How is this any different from a sect distributing its entire treasury to the mortals at the foot of the mountain?"

The Sword Spirit couldn't help but ask Bai Zhenzhen, "Has this guy always been this crazy?"

Images of Zhang Yu from his high school and university days flashed through Bai Zhenzhen's mind. She sighed softly. "Sometimes, I feel like Yu Zi is... like a long, thick sword that refuses to change its shape or be worn down by its surroundings. To him, if the sword doesn't fit, it's the scabbard's fault. He always forces the scabbard to conform to his shape, making everyone around him adapt to him."

Watching Zhang Yu wave his hand, ordering another massive shipment of resources to be hauled away, Bai Zhenzhen's gaze flickered. She captured the scene with her Bionic Eye.

Although they hadn't earned a single Spirit Coin today, for some reason... Bai Zhenzhen felt that Zhang Yu's act of spending money was far more impactful than any of his past money-making ventures. It was like a sword scar etched deep into her heart.

Even long into the future, she would never forget it.

As Zhang Yu continued his relentless raids, the Righteous Qi Alliance finally began to stir.

However, the Alliance's Soul Transformation Assets were protected by numerous restrictions, making them difficult to move. So, some Righteous Qi Alliance cultivators, upon seeing Zhang Yu, proposed a collaboration: they would jointly unlock the Soul Transformation Assets and split the profits. Naturally, Zhang Yu rejected each offer one by one.

They couldn't win if they resisted, and their offers of cooperation were rejected. So, in the raids that followed, the Righteous Qi Alliance cultivators could only watch helplessly as Zhang Yu brutally shattered layer after layer of restrictions and hauled away vast quantities of Soul Transformation Assets.

True Monarch Junior College had been silently observing the situation ever since he fled the battlefield.

Now, his eyes were bloodshot as he watched Zhang Yu breach another Soul Transformation Asset storage point. He felt like a powerless husband standing outside the wall, watching helplessly as Zhang Yu entered and exited repeatedly, seizing everything he held dear.

Whenever he saw the priceless, massive quantities of resources gushing out, he even felt a perverse thrill.

True Monarch Junior College couldn't help but curse himself. "Li Qiuxian! You're useless, Li Qiuxian! You just stand there watching your own possessions being stolen, too cowardly to even show your face!"

Just then, a notification flickered in True Monarch Junior College's Bionic Eye. Someone had posted in the Righteous Qi Alliance's Nascent Soul Group.

True Monarch Flowing Gold: "I've thought of a way to get back the money Zhang Yu stole"

True Monarch Heaven Devourer: "What's the plan?"

True Monarch Calculated Deduction: "I knew we weren't beaten yet! Hurry up and tell us!"

Reading this, True Monarch Junior College's eyes lit up, and he eagerly awaited the plan.

He also recalled True Monarch Flowing Gold's background. This cultivator had once been a Finance Department student at Netherworld University, diligently cultivating the Burning Path Life-Lending Sutra. He had been defeated by Zhang Yu three times, and after his last resurrection, he was reportedly drowning in debt, his cultivation had regressed significantly, and he hadn't even qualified to participate in the Final Battle.

But precisely because of this, he had managed to survive.

True Monarch Flowing Gold: "Zhang Yu stole the Divine Monarchs' money to pay wages at the construction sites. So, if we go work at the construction sites, can't we just steal the money back? With our strength, can ordinary people possibly out-steal us? This way, it's like we're directly stealing from the Divine Monarchs without having to clash with them."

True Monarch Heaven Devourer: "You motherfucker... That's called getting a job."

True Monarch Calculated Deduction: "Besides, our identities are blacklisted. How are we supposed to get jobs?"

True Monarch Flowing Gold: "I've checked Zhang Yu's recruitment requirements. There are no restrictions on education, age, or cultivation. They'll even hire members of the Righteous Qi Alliance and pay them the same, as long as you're willing to be monitored."

True Monarch Heaven Devourer: "You're betraying the Righteous Qi Alliance?!"

True Monarch Flowing Gold: "Betrayal? What betrayal? The Alliance Leader has brought the sky crashing down on us, trying to kill us all. Even the Divine Monarchs have ascended to hold up the sky. What's left for us to betray?"

True Monarch Calculated Deduction: "If we really help the Ten Universities win, won't the Heavenly Court return?"

True Monarch Flowing Gold declared proudly: "The situation is clear. There are only two possible outcomes. Either the sky falls, and we all die together. Or the sky doesn't fall, and the Heavenly Court eventually arrives."

True Monarch Flowing Gold analyzed: "We can either wait to die, or we can work while waiting to die. If the Heavenly Court does descend, at least we'll have earned enough to pay a larger fine and suffer a little less."

True Monarch Flowing Gold was muted.

Staring at the silent group chat, True Monarch Junior College could sense that Flowing Gold's words had likely stirred up a storm of thoughts among the Nascent Soul True Monarchs.

"Should I go work for Zhang Yu?" True Monarch Junior College wondered silently.

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu cracked most of the Soul Transformation Assets on the Kunxu Fifth Layer, he also had Zhang Pianpian start searching Layers 2 to 4 for any Righteous Qi Alliance assets.

As for the First Layer, the passage between it and the Second Layer had been completely sealed by the Heavenly Court during the Great Upheaval, so it was no longer a consideration.

Just then, an unfamiliar account initiated communication with Zhang Yu. It was none other than Divine Monarch Chain Nexus of the Righteous Qi Alliance.

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's voice was cold: "Zhang Yu, haven't you taken enough? If you keep raiding our assets like this, are you not afraid we'll stop cooperating?"

Within the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation, numerous Soul Transformation experts from the Righteous Qi Alliance were currently working alongside those from the Ten Universities to halt the Heaven Collapse.

Without the support of these Righteous Qi Alliance Soul Transformation experts, the Heaven Collapse would likely accelerate rapidly.

Zhang Yu replied, "Divine Monarch Chain Nexus, you have only two choices right now."

"Either you sit back and watch Fu Xiantian succeed in destroying the world, dying before you can spend all your money."

"Or you work with me to stop the Heaven Collapse. No matter how much money is left, at least you'll survive."

After a heated argument, the two sides parted on bad terms.

But Zhang Yu knew that this group of Righteous Qi Alliance Soul Transformation experts, especially those with finance backgrounds, would never stop trying to halt the Heaven Collapse. They were simply too rational, too logical, and absolutely driven by self-interest.

Mutual destruction was something they would never resort to.

Zhang Yu had never particularly liked the Finance Department's style, but at this moment, he suddenly thought it wasn't so bad after all.

"The various personalities, styles, and customs of the Kunxu People aren't entirely without merit," he thought to himself.

While Zhang Yu was frantically raiding the Righteous Qi Alliance's assets, a massive amount of their resources were being continuously sold off.

Because Zhang Yu needed to liquidate them quickly, these assets were dumped at low prices to the Ten Great Universities and their Soul Transformation experts, draining Spirit Coins from them at a furious pace.

The Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts, already exhausted from the long battle and having just supported Zhang Yu with a wave of resources, now found their cash flow at an unprecedented historical low.

However, since the Righteous Qi Alliance's assets were being sold at a steep discount, they still stood to profit. As a result, the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts were quite cooperative.

More and more funds flowed into Zhang Yu's company account, and massive recruitment efforts were approved one by one. The first to be hired were various types of Soul Cultivators.

Zhang Yu understood that to manage and direct a project uniting everyone in the world, the support of a massive number of Soul Cultivators was indispensable. Especially in this situation without Righteous Gods, an even greater number of Soul Cultivators were needed to perform tasks such as monitoring, guidance, record-keeping, and equipment operation.

Therefore, under Zhang Yu's orders, the company prioritized recruiting Soul Cultivators above all else.

Massive numbers of Soul Cultivators traversed the Spirit Realm, deployed to various corners of the Kunxu Fifth Layer according to the construction plan.

With these preparations complete, Zhang Yu knew it was time to further intensify his recruitment campaign.

Next... he would make every cultivator in the world work for him.

In the next moment, countless screens across Kunxu's Second to Fifth Layers flickered simultaneously, forcibly interrupting all broadcasts with an advertisement.

On the screens, Zhang Yu stood on the Kunxu Fifth Layer and began to speak: "To everyone watching, you may or may not already know... the heavens are about to collapse."

As Zhang Yu pointed toward the sky, an image of the heavens collapsing appeared before countless people.

"So I've decided to mend the heavens."

"And to mend the heavens, I've decided to invest..."

Above Zhang Yu's head, a string of numbers began to appear. Zeroes rapidly multiplied, the total growing continuously before the shocked eyes of the crowd.

10,000!

100,000!

1,000,000!

---

At the construction site, Zhou Chechen and Lan Ling stared at the still-growing number on the screen. With each added zero, they felt an earth-shattering pressure that left them breathless.

Zhou Chechen stammered in disbelief, "Zhang Yu... is he really this rich?"

To the former student council president of Songyang High School, Zhang Yu now seemed wealthy enough to buy the entire city of Songyang — no, the entire First Layer!

Beside him, Lan Ling trembled. "It's still rising! It's still rising! How can anyone have this much money? Is he even human? Is he even human?!"

100,000,000!

From the 1.5th Layer, Ye Lingxiao screamed inwardly, "One hundred million Spirit Coins?!"

Gazing at the terrifying number, he saw Zhang Yu on the screen not just as a god, but as something more divine than a Soul Transformation expert, more divine than a Righteous God — the true god of the Fifth Layer at this very moment!

1,000,000,000!

"One billion Spirit Coins!" Wang Yin stared at the number on the screen, feeling a magical force emanating from it. The air around him grew heavy, and he felt an overwhelming urge to kneel and prostrate himself in worship.

He wasn't worshiping Zhang Yu, but the one billion Spirit Coins. In Kunxu, that much money was heaven, was earth, was a divine miracle — it was the goddamn Heavenly Dao itself.

At this moment, Wang Yin felt that whatever Zhang Yu said next would be the absolute truth. How could someone with this much wealth possibly be wrong?

10,000,000,000!

As the digits multiplied, even Kuang Tianqing's eyes widened. His Magic Power surged uncontrollably, and his Bionic Frame showed signs of overload.

"Ten billion Spirit Coins? He actually has ten billion Spirit Coins? Is Zhang Yu really going to throw down ten billion Spirit Coins?!"

Even this Cultivator, who possessed memories from a sect, was utterly stunned by the ten billion Spirit Coins, plunged into a state of profound shock.

He couldn't help but think, "If the Righteous Gods were still around, if the Spirit Realm could still contact the higher realms, what would Zhang Yu be like now? The earth would likely reshape itself to his will, the heavens would sing his praises, the gods would prostrate themselves before him, and the world would revolve around his every thought..."

Meanwhile, on the screen, Zhang Yu spoke each word with unwavering resolve: "To stop the Heaven Collapse, I have decided to invest ten billion Spirit Coins."

"If ten billion isn't enough, I'll sell my company shares, my magical artifacts, my Bionic Frame, my physical body, my very seed... Even if it means losing everything, I will stop the Heaven Collapse this time."

"From this moment on, the people of the world... I, Zhang Yu, will hire them all myself. All the jobs in the world... I, Zhang Yu, will provide them all myself."

"The people they reject, I'll hire. The wages they dare not raise, I'll raise."

"Triple wages, unlimited positions — this is the Ten Billion Heaven Mending project!"

"I will force this heaven back into place!"

At that moment, the overwhelming pressure of ten billion Spirit Coins enveloped heaven and earth. Zhang Yu's figure was seared into everyone's eyes.

With his own power, he was hiring the entire goddamn world! At this moment, wielding ten billion Spirit Coins, Zhang Yu was a god in everyone's eyes. His words were heavenly decrees, and the direction he pointed was the future.

As Zhang Yu's declaration echoed through Kunxu's Second to Fifth Layers, countless people followed the direction of his pointing finger, converging on the Fifth Layer like a great flood.

But Zhang Yu, still on the screen, wasn't finished. He aimed his fingertip at the ground of the Kunxu Fifth Layer and commanded, "Go to work."

"I've placed all ten billion Spirit Coins on the Fifth Layer."

At his fingertip, the ten-billion-digit number in his hand suddenly shattered, transforming into countless densely packed smaller numbers. These were cast across the entire land of the Fifth Layer, linking to one engineering task after another.

In an instant, the entire Fifth Layer was covered in endless question mark projections. Under the Soul Cultivators' monitoring, each question mark represented a different task. Completing a task would earn the Spirit Coins Zhang Yu had invested.

"If you want Spirit Coins, go to work!"

In the sky, waves of people surged upward like a flood, breaking through the barriers between heaven and earth. They rushed toward the Fifth Layer, toward the construction sites, toward their jobs.

From that moment on, whether human or monster, man or woman, from the Ten Universities or Vocational Colleges, all the Kunxu People from the Second to Fifth Layers poured out.

Fear of the Heaven Collapse? The threat of death? No... At this moment, their eyes held only a craving for money, a lust for wealth, a desperate desire for the ten billion Spirit Coins in Zhang Yu's hands.

For Spirit Coins, they would shatter the very earth and dare to mend the collapsing heavens.

As the massive influx of people surged, Ying Xin was shocked to discover the company's performance skyrocketing. Whether it was the Loan Platform or the Great Void Cloud Repository, the number of users experienced another explosive surge.

Ying Xin exclaimed in shock, "To fly to the Fifth Layer for work, so many people rented the Great Void Cloud Repository! And to rent the Great Void Cloud Repository, many of them borrowed money from the Loan Platform!"

At this moment, few people had actually started working on the Fifth Layer; most were still en route. From Ying Xin's perspective, the company's funds weren't decreasing. Instead, as the number of Shared Cloud Repository users and security deposits soared, the money in their accounts began to skyrocket as well.

The astonishing rate and terrifying speed of this growth made Ying Xin's heart pound. It felt like she was witnessing a myth unfold.

"President Zhang, was this part of your plan too? I'm truly in awe..." she thought.

Meanwhile, the construction sites on the Fifth Layer grew even more frenzied.

Chang Buxiu, who had arrived earlier, watched Zhang Yu's video and felt his fighting spirit soar. His Bionic Eye continuously flashed warnings of his Magic Power running at supersonic speeds.

His feet blurred into a series of afterimages as he pushed the small cart before him at incredible speed.

"Ten billion Spirit Coins to pay triple wages? As expected of True Monarch Blazing Light!" he roared inwardly. "He's giving all his money to us as wages!"

"I'll go all out!"

At this moment, Chang Buxiu had only one thought: working 24 hours a day was merely the limit of this world, and exerting Qi Refining power was merely the limit of this cultivation realm. Neither could ever be the limit of his loyalty to True Monarch Blazing Light.

Zhao Tianxing, Mo Tianyi, and other Soul Cultivators were also busy on the vast expanse of the Kunxu Fifth Layer.

Watching countless Nascent Soul, Golden Core, Foundation Establishment, and Qi Refining cultivators swarm out, transforming heaven and earth with a single gesture from Zhang Yu, and seeing the triple Spirit Coin tasks spread across the entire Fifth Layer, Zhao Tianxing's heart surged with emotion.

"Max out my Spirit Realm Flow package!" Zhao Tianxing commanded. "Set the projection display to the lowest quality! Overload Performance Mode! I'm going to do ten times the work today!"

Originally, as the battle situation grew tense and civil engineering projects dwindled, Su Yanyang had felt his sleepiness returning. But after witnessing Zhang Yu's "Ten Billion Heaven Mending," a fire ignited within him, burning away every trace of his drowsiness.

"The instructors at the Restraint and Rest Institute were right," Su Yanyang thought. "A salary increase truly is the best treatment for suppressing the Dual Rest Virus."

Su Yanyang thought to himself, "True Monarch Blazing Light's move today — triple wages for the entire world — has probably cured everyone infected with the Dual Rest Virus in one fell swoop."

Mo Shangjin walked out of the laboratory, sighing inwardly. "I never thought that after all the effort I put into getting into the Artifact Refinement Department and dedicating myself to the lab, I'd end up back on a construction site."

"When I was in Civil Engineering, you were in Artifact Refinement. Now that I'm in Artifact Refinement, you're pouring money back into Civil Engineering."

"True Monarch Blazing Light... you truly are impossible to figure out."

The next moment, channeling the full might of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, he charged toward the construction site on the Fifth Layer.

Amidst the mountains, Gongshu Jin slammed his palm forward. The Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power roared to life, tearing apart and pulverizing vast sections of the mountain range, then transporting the resulting dust and sand far away.

Reaching the Golden Core realm, mastering military-grade martial arts, earning triple wages... Reflecting on it all, Gongshu Jin felt as if he were in a dream. Even the pain of his homeland, the Fourth Layer, being utterly destroyed seemed to have lessened.

"True Monarch Blazing Light..." Gongshu Jin looked up at the sky. "Let's mend this sky. We absolutely cannot let the other Layers... be destroyed like the Fourth Layer was."

Inside the Research Association's laboratory, Jin Jun was the first to bolt out after Zhang Yu's video broadcast interrupted their work.

He grabbed Bei Wufeng, who was standing nearby, and said, "Why are we still in the lab? The True Monarch is already on the construction site! We need to get there now!"

Jin Jun resolved inwardly that even if it meant digging dirt, he would do it right in front of Zhang Yu.

Bei Wufeng sighed to himself. Watching the endless stream of monsterfolk pouring in, he felt a knot tighten in his stomach. The thought of how many billions of the ten billion Spirit Coins would end up in the monsterfolk's accounts made him physically uncomfortable.

"Why do the monsterfolk deserve triple wages?" Bei Wufeng thought bitterly. "Just giving them jobs is already more than they deserve."

---

As hundreds of millions of people surged into the Kunxu Fifth Layer, the entire land underwent earth-shattering changes with each passing moment. The modification of the Stars Filling the Sky Great Formation was proceeding at an unprecedented speed.

It was at this moment that Zhang Yu received a message from Fu Xiantian.

Although Fu Xiantian had already burned his physical body and cultivation to become the Artifact Spirit of the Profound Seal of Great Annihilation's Final Vista, he still retained his final memories and wisdom.

His projection materialized before Zhang Yu and slowly asked, "Was it worth it?"

Zhang Yu replied, "What are you referring to?"

Fu Xiantian said, "Burning ten billion Spirit Coins just to save them. Was it worth it?"

Zhang Yu responded, "There's no 'worth it' or 'not worth it.' They wanted to work, to earn money, and to use that money to survive. That's why they fought against you, and that's why they chose to mend the sky. This is the choice of everyone in Kunxu's Second to Fifth Layers. What's wrong with that?"

"If you think they are wrong, then as I've said... I'll be wrong alongside them."

Fu Xiantian sighed and said slowly, "Human desire is endless. Driven by the pursuit of profit, they will eventually be completely twisted by Kunxu's environment, becoming irredeemable beings."

"Besides, even if you can save the Second to Fifth Layers now, what will you do when the Heavenly Court descends?"

"Zhang Yu, you truly are different. It would be a great pity for you to die here or face the Heavenly Court's reckoning."

Looking at Zhang Yu, Fu Xiantian extended his hand and repeated his invitation: "Come with me to the New World."

Zhang Yu ignored Fu Xiantian's outstretched hand and said, "And if I refuse?"

Fu Xiantian's gaze lowered as he spoke softly, "Zhang Yu, you... are an Evil God Worshipper, aren't you? A believer of the Fortune God?"
