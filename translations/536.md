# Chapter 536: Bonds

In the next instant, Wuying and Xiao Qingxuan clashed violently, their Gang Qi colliding and expanding, unleashing shockwaves that swept outward.

Simultaneously, Xiao Qingxuan found an iron hammer in his hand, seemingly out of nowhere.

Director Gao's words echoed in his mind:

"This Mountain-Moving Hammer was my magical artifact during my Golden Core Stage. With the recent unpredictable shifts in the situation, Magnetic Pole has reforged it for me. I'm lending it to you temporarily."

"But remember, it's still a Golden Core Stage artifact. Don't use it lightly. Only activate it in the most dire circumstances, to protect yourself and Zhang Yu."

Across the battlefield, Wuying's expression flickered slightly. Is this guy using the External Core method? he wondered.

The ancient External Core technique?

But he shouldn't have a Golden Core certification.

With that thought, Wuying's Bionic Eye began recording the battle.

Though he still remembered the opponent's appearance from moments ago, by the time the recording started, the figure was completely enveloped in Gang Qi.

It was impossible to identify anyone from the footage alone.

Wuying didn't care. Filming was just a side project. Once he defeated his opponent and forced them to join the Demonic Sect, he'd have plenty of ways to find leverage over them.

"A mere Pseudo-Core dares to challenge me?"

While Xiao Qingxuan and Wuying clashed fiercely, Shi Yunxiang and Ying Xin frantically dug into the ground, channeling their energy to create a massive pit in the blink of an eye.

Their thunderous roars alerted Zhang Yu, Yu Xinghan, Shi Huaiyu, Xiao Qingxuan, and the others.

During the relentless exchanges, Xiao Qingxuan and Wuying had already moved toward the pit.

"Trying to escape?" Wuying chuckled softly. "Do you really think you can outrun me?"

In a lightning-fast maneuver, Wuying surged ahead of Xiao Qingxuan, blocking the pit's entrance to cut off their retreat.

But in the next furious exchange, Wuying realized his opponent was deliberately driving him toward the pit.

Under the Mountain-Moving Hammer's relentless bombardment, Wuying was forced to retreat involuntarily.

Wuying abruptly halted his retreat, preparing to surge forward in a counterattack.

But at that moment, the ground beneath his feet shattered layer by layer under Yu Xinghan's control, causing Wuying to lose his footing.

"Hah!"

With a fierce roar, Wuying channeled his Gang Qi, propelling himself upward once more.

Shi Huaiyu's Earthly Fiend Gravity erupted, forming layers of resistance that blocked his path.

Xiao Qingxuan raised the Mountain-Moving Hammer and brought it crashing down again.

"Get out of my way!" Wuying bellowed, having endured the opponent's powerful strikes and briefly fallen into the crater, he was about to launch another counterattack.

But in the next instant, as Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang unleashed their combined assault, blinding electrical arcs erupted beneath Wuying's feet.

Ying Xin thought to herself, "This is the Magic Power Circuit powering the Primordial Magnetic Channel..."

Shi Yunxiang watched Wuying engulfed in the electric light, thinking, "With the power of the Primordial Magnetic Channel, capable of transporting tens of thousands of tons of material every second, he was instantly permeated by its Magic Power Circuits, and his entire body was impacted by violent electromagnetic Magic Power. Even a Golden Core..."

As Civil Engineering students who had long worked on construction sites, they were intimately familiar with the structure of University City, including the layout of the main Magic Power Circuits and spiritual energy circuits on each layer.

Initially, the oppressive aura of the Demonic Sect's Golden Core cultivator had paralyzed their minds, leaving them devoid of any will to resist.

It wasn't until Zhang Yu stepped forward to shield them, and Yu Xinghan, Shi Huaiyu, and Xiao Qingxuan each erupted into action, that they finally remembered their own capacity for resistance.

The moment they finished digging the pit, the other Civil Engineering students instantly grasped their plan, reaching a silent consensus.

At that moment, as Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang deliberately overloaded the Magic Power Circuits within the building, the falling Wuying crashed through, sending muffled tremors through the ground.

In an instant, countless Primordial Magnetic Channels were disrupted and damaged, sending shivers down Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang's spines.

Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang thought in unison, their hearts pounding with dread: "Damaging public infrastructure... If they trace this back to us, who knows how much we'll have to pay in compensation?"

But in the very next moment...

Roar!

Amidst a furious roar, Wuying, his body crackling with electricity and his flesh still tearing apart, suddenly surged upward, attempting to claw his way out of the crater.

Xiao Qingxuan bellowed, raising his Mountain-Moving Hammer and charging forward once more: "Block him!"

"Die, you bastard!" Yu Xinghan roared, activating his Minor Threefold Combination to relentlessly destroy the ground beneath Wuying's feet, denying him any foothold.

Shi Huaiyu channeled her full power, transforming her Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power into countless invisible arms that frantically dragged Wuying downward.

I won't let you live! Today, either you die or we do! she screamed inwardly.

Flames erupted around Wuying's body as he unleashed another secret technique, repelling the relentless attacks and nearly breaking free.

Just then, Zhang Yu suddenly appeared before him, seemingly out of nowhere.

When did this guy show up?! Wuying thought in alarm, his eyes widening as he saw Zhang Yu's blood-soaked right arm had been replaced with a Bionic.

His peripheral vision darted to the distance, toward the spot where he had discarded Mo Shangjin moments earlier.

He saw Le Mulan clutching Zhang Yu's severed arm, continuously channeling Profound Cold Magic Power into it.

Wuying's heart jolted. "After disappearing just now... did this kid sever his injured right arm and replace it with Mo Shangjin's Hand Bionic?"

Zhang Yu hadn't merely replaced Mo Shangjin's Bionic; he had also used the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force to recharge another round of Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

Thus, the Double Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power erupted once more, channeling through his Hand Bionic. In the next instant, it transformed into a white comet, hurtling down toward Wuying, who was trying to break free from the earth.

This time, Zhang Yu didn't enhance his defense with the Civil Engineering Holy Body. Instead, he activated the Martial Dao Holy Body, pushing the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power and Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force to their absolute limits.

Bang!

Faced with Wuying's desperate resistance, Zhang Yu's flesh and blood violently ruptured, his body threatening to disintegrate completely.

Yet Wuying, struck by Zhang Yu's ultimate attack, was once again forced downward.

Simultaneously, the combined assaults of Yu Xinghan, Shi Huaiyu, Xiao Qingxuan, and the others rained down anew.

Beneath him, surging Electromagnetic Magic Power continuously poured into his body, the berserk energy shattering his meridians and physical body, obliterating everything within his flesh.

"Damn it!"

Wuying's eyes widened as he stared at the scene unfolding before him through his Bionic Eye, desperately trying to record every moment.

"Damn it!"

He strained to connect to the Spirit Realm, attempting to transmit the footage captured by his Bionic Eye.

But the raging Electromagnetic Magic Power interfered with the Bionics within his body, causing his Bionic Eye to flicker violently. Not only could he not connect to the Spirit Realm, but even maintaining the recording became impossible.

"I..."

With a thunderous roar, Wuying's body was completely engulfed by electric light, leaving no trace of life.

On the other side, Zhang Yu collapsed backward, his flesh torn and bloody, but Le Mulan caught him. She immediately channeled vast amounts of Profound Cold Magic Power into his body, sealing his wounds.

Simultaneously, she sliced open her arm and fed her medicinal blood into Zhang Yu's mouth.

Feeling the Medicinal Power surging through his veins, Zhang Yu instinctively opened his mouth wide and began sucking forcefully on Le Mulan's arm.

Meanwhile, Xiao Qingxuan followed closely behind, using Ancient Medical Techniques to treat Zhang Yu.

After a moment, Xiao Qingxuan, who was applying the Ancient Medical Techniques, glanced at Le Mulan with surprise, seemingly astonished by the effectiveness of her Profound Cold Magic Power.

Feeling Xiao Qingxuan's gaze, Le Mulan's heart jolted. "Has he noticed the effects of the Profound Cold Magic Power? The life-extending effect?"

But seeing Zhang Yu before her, nearly shattered, Le Mulan gritted her teeth and continued channeling the Profound Cold Magic Power.

At the same time, Zhang Yu, his head swimming, mustered all his strength to gradually shift his Chain Formation Diagram from the Martial Dao Holy Body back to the Civil Engineering Holy Body.

In an instant, his plummeting life force stabilized and began to recover under the combined healing efforts of Xiao Qingxuan and Le Mulan.

Fueled by the mental cultivation technique's infusion, his flesh and blood reactivated, accelerating his self-healing.

Zhang Yu finally exhaled in relief. "Thank goodness the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo retained some effects from the various Chain Method Diagram Sets. Otherwise, Wuying's final strike... might have killed me outright."

While Le Mulan and Xiao Qingxuan were healing Zhang Yu, Shi Huaiyu unleashed a palm strike across the distance at Li Xiao.

The transformed Li Xiao opened his massive maw, as if to speak.

But Shi Huaiyu gave him no chance. Her fingers spread wide, unleashing the overwhelming Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, tearing Li Xiao's body into pieces.

"Why?!" Li Xiao's eyes widened as he stared at Zhang Yu, surrounded by the crowd. His heart seethed with resentment as he roared inwardly, "Why are you all risking your lives to help him?"

Shock, fear, anger... and jealousy surged through Li Xiao's mind in a relentless torrent.

"Why didn't you help me back then?!"

"Wh...y...?"

Li Xiao strained to open his mouth, inwardly screaming his own name.

"At least... at least I want you to know... to know it was me, Li Xiao... to know it's because you offended me, Li Xiao, that..."

In the next instant, Shi Huaiyu shattered his body again and again, reducing him to a cloud of blood mist that dispersed into the air.

Shi Huaiyu then turned to the massive crater where the Magic Power Circuit lay.

The circuit had already entered a shutdown state due to emergency measures triggered by the malfunction.

Seeing the Demonic Sect Golden Core's charred remains, Shi Huaiyu unleashed the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power once more, completely pulverizing the body and erasing all traces of its existence.

As Shi Huaiyu finished her work, she noticed a perfectly intact black orb amidst the pulverized remains.

Just as she frowned, pondering how to handle the orb, Zhang Yu's voice came from behind her.

"May I take a look?"

As Zhang Yu spoke, Lady Fortune urgently urged him in his mind, "Hold that orb! That thing... that thing must have been created by a High-Ranking Evil God."

Lady Fortune thought excitedly, "They succeeded? They actually did it?"

The moment Zhang Yu grasped the orb, he felt his consciousness establish a connection with it.

In the next instant, with Lady Fortune's guidance, Zhang Yu felt his will being pulled through the orb, traversing layers of the Spirit Realm until he arrived in an unknown space.

Beneath the vast starry sky, three colossal, malevolent figures, their evil aura soaring to the heavens, surrounded an ancient wooden-carved round table.

As Zhang Yu and Lady Fortune arrived, these three twisted, gigantic, and malevolent beings turned their collective gaze upon them.
