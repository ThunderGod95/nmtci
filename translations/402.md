# Chapter 402: Immortal Fortune

As Su Yanyang pondered the competition for the Military Certificate, a message flashed across his Bionic Eye:

"Su Yanyang! When are you going to pay up?"

"Hiring Soul Cultivators and refusing to pay? Do you think you can get away with that?"

Simultaneously, the debt collection messages appeared not only in Su Yanyang's Bionic Eye but also in the Bionic Eyes of everyone around him, instantly changing the way the Civil Engineering Department students looked at him.

Su Yanyang calmly finished his bowl of rice, thinking to himself, "Debt Collection Talisman, huh?"

Ma Xuan, sitting beside him, couldn't help but say, "Senior, shouldn't you just pay them back? If you keep getting hit with these Debt Collection Talismans, your reputation will keep dropping, and that'll hurt your academic progress, right?"

Su Yanyang replied coolly, "I hired those Soul Cultivator Students to do a job for me. They failed to complete it, so why should I pay them? Let them send debt collectors or file lawsuits — I don't care. If they can actually get money out of me in the end, then they've earned it."

In Su Yanyang's view, avoiding Spirit Coin losses and preserving one's Immortal Dao Potential were essential lessons on the path to immortality.

Meanwhile, in the distance, Xiao Yunji pierced her neck with a needle. As the medicinal fluid slowly flowed into her veins, the stinging pain gradually subsided.

After confirming that her Bionic's synchronization rate had returned to normal, Xiao Yunji finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Gone was the six-armed, three-headed form she had displayed in the arena. Her Bionic now shimmered with a metallic sheen, making her appear like an ordinary university student.

"The transformable Bionic is powerful, but its synchronization rate drops too easily," she thought to herself. "Once I pass the Military Certificate exam, I'll need to replace this Bionic."

Her gaze swept over Su Yanyang and another student from the Civil Engineering Department. "Su Yanyang and Ping Han of the War Faction — these two will likely be my greatest rivals in the next Military Certificate exam," she mused.

"Especially Ping Han. As Mo Shangjin's teammate in the Competition Team, he's a year older than Mo Shangjin and already a senior. He's already mastered the Seven Absolutes."

"If he hadn't repeatedly failed at cryptocurrency trading, he would have passed the Military Certificate exam long ago."

As for Zhang Yu? Xiao Yunji naturally dismissed the junior she had chased all over the arena.

As Xiao Yunji's gaze swept over Ping Han, the student had already approached Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu turned to look at the senior before him, who was clad in Extreme Tiger Brand Bionics, then curiously glanced at the Civil Engineering Department's fourth-place ranking displayed above the senior's head.

"The fourth-ranked student in Civil Engineering is using Extreme Tiger Brand?"

Although Zhang Yu hadn't delved deeply into researching various Bionic brands, he had often heard Yu Xinghan, Li Xiao, Gongshu Jin, and others commenting on them.

He knew that Extreme Tiger Brand was a standard budget brand, a trendy item for Junior College Students, and a lifesaver for First Layer students, known for its affordability and durability.

Yu Xinghan's assessment was: "Using Extreme Tiger at Myriad Laws University guarantees a failed university career."

But Zhang Yu recognized Ping Han, or rather, he had seen the senior's performance in the arena.

"He wasn't using this set of Bionics in the arena, was he?"

"Then he must use Extreme Tiger for daily practice and switch to his main Bionics for crucial moments."

As Zhang Yu pondered, Ping Han grinned at him and said, "Junior Brother Zhang Yu, are you wondering why I'm using Extreme Tiger Brand?"

"Are you thinking... that I used a different Bionic in the arena? That I usually use the Extreme Tiger Brand but switch to a better one for crucial moments?"

Ping Han shook his head. "Actually, I only have this one Extreme Tiger Brand Bionic. During the competition, my teammates lent me their spare Bionics."

"I used to own a Heavenly Craftsman Bionic, but I sold it all."

A glint flashed in Ping Han's eyes as he said earnestly, "I realized something: instead of wasting money on Bionics, it's better to invest in cryptocurrency."

"I have some insider information about Joyful Union University's Jade Nectar Coin. Are you interested in investing?"

Zhang Yu shook his head repeatedly. "I don't trade cryptocurrency."

"You don't trade cryptocurrency?" Ping Han exclaimed, his voice filled with dismay. "You're a university student! How do you expect to achieve Immortal Cultivation if you don't trade cryptocurrency?"

"Do you think you can reach Immortal Cultivation by working a job?"

Zhang Yu paused, slightly taken aback. That was precisely what he had been thinking.

Seeing Zhang Yu's silence, Ping Han shook his head again. "We toil like dogs on construction sites, and how much do we earn in a year? That money can only extend our Lifespan, forcing us to work even longer. It's impossible to break through to a higher Cultivation Realm with that kind of money."

"I've studied the cultivation histories of cultivators who achieved Golden Core and Nascent Soul in the past fifty years."

"Not a single one of them broke through their cultivation realm by working a job."

"Every single one of them — and I mean every single one — was either already wealthy when they entered the sect or became rich quickly before breaking through."

Ping Han looked earnestly at Zhang Yu and said, "Junior Brother Zhang Yu, Immortal Dao Potential isn't something you accumulate gradually. True, profound Immortal Dao Potential surges forth in sudden bursts."

"In this era, you'll never reach Golden Core by just working a job."

"You'd be better off trading cryptocurrencies. Win, and you can advance to Golden Core and Nascent Soul. Lose, and at least you won't waste time on cultivation."

"Immortal or demon — you'll know your fate in a few years. Isn't that far more reliable than toiling away for a century only to realize you have no hope left and regret not trading cryptocurrencies when you were younger?"

Lady Fortune sighed, "Another one obsessed with Immortal Cultivation. He must have lost a fortune trading cryptocurrencies and transferred all his Immortal Dao Potential to the Soul Transformation Divine Monarch."

Zhang Yu said helplessly, "Forget it... I still want to work."

"Sigh," Ping Han sighed. "You don't understand. With cryptocurrency, there's still a chance to win. But working... working will never let you break through your Cultivation Realm."

"No hope... no hope at all."

"Since you're not willing to gamble on immortal fortune, could you lend me some Spirit Coins?"

Zhang Yu refused again, and Ping Han left with another sigh.

Just then, a message appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye:

Mo Shangjin: "You were right not to lend him money."

Zhang Yu looked up and saw Mo Shangjin had arrived unnoticed, surrounded by students and engaged in conversation.

As if sensing Zhang Yu's gaze, Mo Shangjin smiled and nodded slightly from afar.

Mo Shangjin: "The first time Ping Han traded cryptocurrency, he earned 50 Spirit Coins."

Mo Shangjin: "After that, he became completely addicted."

Mo Shangjin: "After losing a lot, he asked Teacher Gao for 10 Spirit Coins."

Mo Shangjin: "Teacher Gao told him he had no talent for cryptocurrency and advised him to stay away, refusing to lend him the money."

Mo Shangjin: "But the coin Ping Han wanted to buy skyrocketed in value. If he'd had those 10 Spirit Coins, he could have made over 400 Spirit Coins."

Mo Shangjin: "Since then, he's been completely obsessed, and no one can stop him."

Mo Shangjin: "This incident has become a Heart Demon on his path to immortality. If he ever asks you for money again, absolutely do not lend him any."

As Zhang Yu listened to Mo Shangjin's story, he thought to himself, "So that's what happened? If I had missed out on a profit of over 400 Spirit Coins, I probably wouldn't be able to get over it for a long time either."

Lady Fortune commented, "Immortal Cultivation is like that. There are countless Heart Demons along the way. Only by forging a flawless dao heart, untroubled by external demons, can one ascend step by step."

Just then, another Senior from the Civil Engineering Department approached Zhang Yu to treat him to a meal. Zhang Yu snapped out of his reverie and immediately resumed eating, feeling waves of potent spiritual energy surging through his body with each bite.

Nearby, Feng Tingting watched the clinking bowls and Zhang Yu's hearty appetite, thinking to herself, "This food intake for a 12.75 is quite impressive. He'd make excellent artifact refinement material... I wonder if he'd be willing to sell?"

Glancing at the 12.75 mark above Zhang Yu's head, Feng Tingting figured he probably wasn't wealthy and decided to consider asking him.

Just as Feng Tingting was pondering this, she noticed sword light flashing repeatedly around Zhang Yu.

"This is... someone is forcibly summoning him with a Sound Transmission Talisman? These talismans are incredibly expensive. Who's using one?"

"12.75 probably didn't prepare any countermeasures in advance. Unless he stays offline, he'll have no choice but to let the summoner descend."

In the next moment, the flickering sword light suddenly coalesced, transforming into Wen Wuya's figure, which materialized before Zhang Yu.

Wen Wuya watched Zhang Yu devouring his meal, finally understanding why the other man hadn't replied to his messages.

With a wave of his hand, the Silence Talisman activated. He then asked Zhang Yu, "I tried to talk to Bai Zhenzhen about dual cultivation, but after just a few words, she started avoiding me. Do you have any advice? I'm desperate."

Zhang Yu rubbed his head, slightly dizzy from eating too quickly, and gave Wen Wuya a helpless look. He thought to himself, "Thank goodness Bai Zhenzhen had countermeasures from Heavenly Sword University last time. Otherwise, this guy would be a real nuisance."

After a moment's thought, Zhang Yu said, "A-Zhen likes men who are sterilized."

"In her view, only sterilized men have the resolve to cultivate the Dao and possess true masculinity."

Wen Wuya pondered this. "That's it? Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

Just then, Wen Wuya's eyes flashed, and he suddenly turned his gaze toward Feng Tingting.

Feng Tingting's heart skipped a beat when she saw Wen Wuya appear.

She had watched the Flying Sword Tournament recently and recognized Wen Wuya as a Soul Transformation Disciple from Heavenly Sword University.

Seeing him forcibly project his consciousness to contact Zhang Yu instantly piqued her curiosity.

Activating her Bionic, she tried to eavesdrop on their conversation beneath the Silence Talisman's concealment.

However, the talisman was clearly of high grade. Despite her best efforts, she only managed to catch fragments: "I... dual cultivation... you... urgent."

Staring at the fragmented words floating across her Bionic Eye, Feng Tingting's pupils dilated in shock as she turned to Zhang Yu. "Is that really true?"

"Zhang Yu is the dual cultivation partner of a Soul Transformation Disciple?"

"He actually stumbled upon such immense immortal fortune?"

But in the next moment, Wen Wuya turned his head, his gaze locking onto her with murderous intent.

"Eavesdropping on my conversation?"

"You have quite the nerve."

With a swift gesture, Wen Wuya seized the words floating across Feng Tingting's Bionic Eye, crushing them into dust that vanished into nothingness.
