# Chapter 411: The Grand Bargain

Faced with Yin Jiurao's offer of 30 Spirit Coins, Zhang Yu couldn't deny the temptation.

But he couldn't bring himself to sell without reservations.

"The Divine Spiritual Root is too important. If anything goes wrong, it would be disastrous."

His first thought turned to Bai Zhenzhen.

That night, during their usual call, Zhang Yu casually asked, "A-Zhen, if you hadn't revealed your Divine Spiritual Root back then, do you think it would have been exposed after you reached the Second Layer?"

Bai Zhenzhen replied casually, "Probably not..."

Through Zhang Yu's deliberate probing, he reaffirmed the Divine Spiritual Root's remarkable concealment ability. Ordinary physical examinations couldn't detect its presence.

However, the physical enhancements it granted were undeniable. The changes to his physical body caused by the Divine Spiritual Root couldn't be completely hidden.

After hearing Bai Zhenzhen's explanation, Zhang Yu gradually gained confidence.

The next day, he rented a laboratory with Le Mulan, intending to personally analyze his materials and check for any anomalies.

Of course, he switched the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo to its Third Eye Mystic Power form for the analysis.

---

In the laboratory, Le Mulan channeled her Magic Power into a mirror suspended in mid-air, causing Zhang Yu's material to appear magnified countless times.

Zhang Yu asked somewhat awkwardly, "What do you think?"

Le Mulan tilted her head. "It seems... a little different from before."

She picked up a beaker, swirled it, and said, "This is the first time I've worked with something so fresh. It feels so active, and the temperature is consistently high. Could that be related to your technique?"

Zhang Yu retorted, "I didn't bring you here to play around!"

Le Mulan turned to him. "I'm not playing around. What's so fun about this?"

Zhang Yu looked away. "Anyway... using the methods you've learned, have you found anything?"

Le Mulan continued her analysis, pursing her lips. "There's been an improvement in quality. The strength and activity of all the materials are higher than before..."

As Zhang Yu watched Le Mulan's repeated tests, he thought to himself, "As expected, the characteristics of the Divine Spiritual Root won't manifest in my physical materials."

"But after the Divine Spiritual Root's repeated enhancements, my body is indeed different from before."

Zhang Yu asked, "Your mentor's methods must be far more advanced than yours. She could probably extract even more insights from this, right?"

Le Mulan nodded. "Teacher Yin is an expert in self-producing pharmaceutical technology. Her body itself functions as a complete pharmaceutical factory and laboratory."

"Even without these devices, she could analyze over two hundred pages of data simply by absorbing your materials into her body. In this regard, she far surpasses me. However..."

Although Yin Jiurao's mastery of Immortal Dao Technology far exceeded Le Mulan's, Le Mulan didn't believe Zhang Yu's materials had undergone any fundamental changes. Even if Professor Yin could analyze more data, Le Mulan doubted it would lead to any groundbreaking conclusions.

"What she truly wants is the right to reproduce."

Le Mulan turned to Zhang Yu and said, "She might secretly breed descendants using your bloodline in hopes of obtaining further research results. Are you absolutely sure you don't want to sell the reproduction rights?"

---

Faced with Le Mulan's suggestion, Zhang Yu knew he couldn't negotiate with Yin Jiurao alone. He needed someone with sufficient authority to vouch for the deal.

So Zhang Yu went to Director Gao.

Hearing Zhang Yu's proposal, Director Gao's eyes widened in surprise. "30 Spirit Coins?"

"She only wants you?"

Director Gao thought to himself, "If the Pharmacology Department professors have such needs, I could organize Civil Engineering students into groups to sell themselves."

This kind of research work would be far more lucrative and respectable than working on construction sites.

Zhang Yu shook his head. "She only wants me."

Director Gao nodded slightly, surmising that Zhang Yu's unique qualities had caught her attention.

However, Director Gao had previously consulted a friend, a professor in the Department of Reproduction at Celestial Monsters University, and learned that Zhang Yu's special constitution couldn't be easily studied through his physical body or bloodline expression.

"Once Yin Jiurao researches him, she'll definitely regret offering such a high price."

Director Gao looked at Zhang Yu, feeling proud that his student had the skill to sell trash for a fortune.

"You've done well. Take this salesmanship into the Civil Engineering industry and make good use of it."

As for the reproduction rights, Director Gao saw no need to sell them.

After all, Zhang Yu was no ordinary student. In Director Gao's eyes, he had great potential, and there was no need to leave his bloodline on the Second Layer, which could later create vulnerabilities and hinder his cultivation.

"I'll negotiate the contract with her for you."

---

Yin Jiurao frowned at Director Gao. "A contract witnessed by a Righteous God?"

Director Gao replied, "Professor Yin, let's be frank. Zhang Yu is a highly promising student in our Civil Engineering Department. I don't want him to leave behind descendants prematurely, burdening him with unnecessary karmic entanglements."

After some negotiation, Yin Jiurao agreed to sign the contract, but the price was reduced from 30 Spirit Coins to 25 Spirit Coins, and she insisted on collecting the materials herself.

"I don't trust him to do it properly," she said coolly. "I'll collect the materials myself."

Director Gao saw no problem with this. After all, she was paying 25 Spirit Coins. Collecting the materials herself was like picking fruit she had already bought — perfectly reasonable.

However, he added, "I'll need to supervise the entire process to prevent you from over-harvesting Zhang Yu's bodily materials."

Under Director Gao's watchful eye, Yin Jiurao firmly gripped Zhang Yu...

Throughout the process, Zhang Yu felt like a piece of meat on a cutting board, his body being harvested by Yin Jiurao under Director Gao's supervision.

Blood, saliva, urine, skin tissue, hair, seed...

After each material was extracted, Director Gao confirmed its accuracy, and Yin Jiurao would immediately transfer Spirit Coins into Zhang Yu's account.

At that moment, Zhang Yu suddenly felt with crystal clarity the price his body had been bought and sold for.

However, once everything was completed and Zhang Yu's account balance surged past 55 Spirit Coins, the strange feeling in his heart vanished completely, replaced by overwhelming joy and excitement.

He was already looking forward to using the money to go on an artifact refinement spree, further advancing his Artifact Refinement Technique.

As they left, Director Gao said, "Remember, in the future, always insist on a contract witnessed by a Righteous God. Otherwise, if the profits are high enough, the other party will inevitably take risks."

"How's the construction project going lately? Once we finish up at the Pharmaceutical Factory, I plan to assign you to another project. I'll send you the details later, so be sure to prepare in advance..."

"Alright, you should head back to the construction site and get back to work."

After parting ways with Zhang Yu, who returned to the construction site, Director Gao hummed softly to himself and couldn't resist sending another message to True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Director Gao: "Zhang Yu's materials sold for 25 Spirit Coins."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Your disciple is truly remarkable."

Director Gao smiled faintly.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: [Artifact Refinement Screenshot]

The screenshot showed someone refining Azure Heaven Sand, but only a blurry half-figure was visible, making it impossible to discern their true appearance.

Judging by the camera angle, the shot appeared to have been taken from the opposite side of the laboratory, capturing the subject from behind.

Director Gao: "What's this?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Didn't I tell you about the student I took in through connections?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "He's recently started artifact refinement. I had another student mentor him."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Though his progress is slow, he does show some talent."

Director Gao: "Then it seems he's worth nurturing."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "Indeed. I plan to give him more opportunities."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "If he ever refines a usable magical artifact, I'll let you try it out."

Director Gao: "Agreed."

Shortly after Zhang Yu and Director Gao departed, Yin Jiurao picked up a measuring cup...

After a swallow, she licked her lips. As her Magic Power circulated, a wealth of data from Zhang Yu's blood materialized within her Bionic Eye.

In the next moment, her pupils dilated sharply.

"This is..."

After a long pause, Yin Jiurao smiled faintly. "Heh, my research paper for this year is secured."

---

Zhang Yu returned to the Pharmaceutical Factory and headed to the medicine assembly line workshop to take measurements.

With the expansion of the basic operator assembly line completed, he was now responsible for constructing the medicine assembly line workshop.

The moment Zhang Yu appeared, the previously numb and bored operators on the assembly line stirred slightly, their eyes turning toward him.

"Is that a Foundation Establishment Student from Myriad Laws University?"

"One of the Ten Greats Foundation Establishment Students! I wonder how much he earns working here."

"I bet at least 0.1 Spirit Coins a day."

"That's like getting paid just to poke needles all day? No need to worry about data usage for watching videos?"

"Sigh, guess studying hard and getting into the Ten Greats is still the only way to make something of yourself."

Meanwhile, after measuring and recording the data, Zhang Yu arrived at the construction site. With a sudden surge of energy, Gang Qi erupted from his body, shooting out in all directions.

As the Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch soared into the sky, Formless Warriors, each carrying Azure Heaven Sand, began their work.

Qi Spirit Zhao Tianxing, controlling the 3rd-tier Azure Cloud Gathering Pouch, sensed a significant increase in the amount of Azure Heaven Sand being processed. The pouch's operational ease had also improved considerably, and its enhancements to the Formless Warriors had reached a new level.

Zhang Yu watched the scene with satisfaction, thinking to himself, "With the magical artifact's enhancement, my work efficiency has indeed improved significantly these past few weeks."

He calculated that he had earned over five Spirit Coins from working at the Pharmaceutical Factory construction site during the past half-month.

"Earn Spirit Coins at the construction site to improve my Artifact Refinement Technique."

"Refine magical artifacts to further boost my earning efficiency at the construction site."

Zhang Yu mused inwardly, "This is truly the best way for a poor man like me to learn artifact refinement."

He understood that until he achieved some success in artifact refinement and could earn money by selling magical artifacts, his income from the construction site remained crucial.

In the next moment Formless Cloud Gang Qi, resembling a vast, swirling mist, completely enveloped Zhang Yu's body as he began cultivating the ninth cultivation art of the Martial Dao Holy Body.

He thought to himself, "Once all ten cultivation arts of the Martial Dao Holy Body reach Level 20, I won't need to continue cultivating at the construction site."

"Then, I can use the Martial Dao Holy Body to enhance my work, earn even more Spirit Coins, and then..."

"Pour all my resources into artifact refinement!"
