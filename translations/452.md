# Chapter 452: Inverted Kunlun (6/6)

Hearing Shi Huaiyu's question, Mo Shangjin explained, "Zhang Yu is our team's secret weapon. We should keep his full strength hidden until we face the other Ten Greats."

"Besides, our next match will be against Vajra University's team at Myriad Laws."

"They've probably been watching your match this whole time."

Curious, Zhang Yu asked, "How strong is Vajra University's Civil Engineering Department?"

"Vajra University..." Mo Shangjin pondered before explaining, "Their Artifact Refinement Department excels at transforming students' bodies into various magical artifacts. Campus body trade thrives there. Their body refinement techniques achieve exceptional compatibility with their university's standardized Bionic systems!"

"For them, the physical body is crucial because diligently refined flesh can be sold for profit."

"For them, the physical body is meaningless because the entire university follows uniform body refinement and Bionic standards. Students swap bodies and Bionic components as easily as changing clothes..."

Zhang Yu pressed further, "What about military-grade martial arts? How many of them have mastered those?"

Mo Shangjin said, "The military-grade martial art of Vajra University's Civil Engineering Department is called Great Sun Manifestations. I remember one person mastered it last year."

"But that person should have graduated this year."

"I don't think any students in the teams you'll be facing have mastered it yet."

Su Yanyang, standing nearby, asked, "Senior Mo, how much longer until your injuries heal?"

"We can handle ordinary Upper and Lower College students ourselves."

"But if our opponents are also at the level of the Ten Greats, and some possess Military-Grade power, we might need you."

Mo Shangjin sighed helplessly. "My body has been tainted by fiend energy, and I'm currently undergoing purification."

"This can't be rushed. It'll take at least two more months to resolve."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's mind raced. No wonder Mo Shangjin and the other student were severely injured, while Li Zhen could still participate in the competition!

Li Zhen's specialty must be manipulating fiend energy!

He turned to Li Zhen and asked, "Senior Li, does cultivating fiend energy martial arts have any adverse effects on your body?"

Li Zhen replied, "Of course it does! The aging process accelerates, and you're prone to all sorts of occupational diseases. None of them can be avoided!"

Su Yanyang asked, puzzled, "Then why specialize in fiend energy?"

Li Zhen explained, "Even though it shortens your lifespan and reduces your total working hours, your hourly income increases. It's like spending your old age's lifespan in advance, doubling its value while you're young. What's wrong with that?"

"Besides, what construction job doesn't wear down your body? You can't do it forever. While fiend energy research is harmful, if you excel, you can transition to environmental fields later!"

"The Thirty-Six Heavenly Gang Qi and Seventy-Two Earthly Fiend Qi are all related to environmental issues!"

"The environment is a huge problem. The higher your cultivation, the greater your impact on it. As Immortal Dao technology advances, Kunxu will inevitably prioritize environmental governance!"

After the competition at Golden River University, Zhang Yu hurried back to Myriad Laws University, resuming his routine of studying, cultivating, and working part-time.

Finally, in late December, Zhang Yu successfully advanced Fingertip Earth to Gold to Level 20.

With all six Civil Engineering Arts and Seven Wonders now at Level 20, the first layer of the Inverted Kunlun in his Chain Formation Diagram was finally completed!

Basic - Inverted Kunlun (6/6): The destructive and transformative effects of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering on the environment are doubled!

Zhang Yu's gaze shifted as he observed the effect. "Environmental alteration?"

---

The next day, after arriving at the 669th-floor construction site, he conducted a series of tests and roughly determined the effects of the first layer of Inverted Kunlun. Whether it was basic mud and sand, half-built reinforced concrete structures, or completed buildings, all were considered part of the environment.

When combined with this layer of Inverted Kunlun, the effects and range of Zhang Yu's single Cultivation Arts, such as the Minor Threefold Combination or Fingertip Earth to Gold, were dramatically amplified!

He gently spread his fingers, and wisps of metallic powder were drawn from the mud and sand, coalescing into a small, metallic cloud that swirled and shifted in his palm according to his will.

"Since the Minor Threefold Combination works, the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power should also be effective!"

"This means that activating the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power will cause even stronger and more extensive environmental changes!"

"With this, I've become a construction god! Who in the Civil Engineering Department can build faster than me?"

Zhang Yu's excitement grew. "I'll reach the pinnacle of the construction site and earn hourly wages that countless workers wouldn't even dare to dream of!"

Zhang Yu secretly calculated that once the construction project truly took off, his earnings would likely far surpass what he currently made from artifact crafting.

"At this rate, I should be able to fund my artifact crafting with construction earnings for quite some time!"

"Ah, but I still have to wait until January!"

Though impatient, Zhang Yu knew rushing wouldn't help. He suppressed his excitement and buried himself back in work.

"Stay steady, Zhang Yu. The more critical the moment, the less you can afford to rush!"

He silently reminded himself: "Follow the plan. Keep learning, keep working, keep cultivating. Even mastering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power is just the beginning!"

"My goal is the Ten Great Sects. There's still a long way to go!"

Before he knew it, the second match of the Civil Engineering Inter-University League had arrived, this time held at Myriad Laws University.

Vajra University brought six official team members and three substitutes.

At the entrance to the arena, Chan Rong, the leader of Vajra University's team, glanced at Zhang Yu and his group with a faint smile.

"Mo Shangjin isn't competing?" Chan Rong remarked. "Looks like his injury is more serious than we thought!"

Zhang Yu asked calmly, "Do you know Senior Mo?"

Chan Rong murmured, "Of course I know him!"

"Do you remember last year's battle against Myriad Laws? Mo Shangjin used the Seven Absolutes Bionic to activate the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power and completely overturn the entire Examination Field!"

"What a world-shattering strike! I still remember our team's Senior Brother desperately resisting with the Great Sun Manifestations, only to be brutally defeated by Mo Shangjin and thrown out of the arena!"

Zhang Yu glanced at Mo Shangjin's projection beside him and sent a private message: You were too ruthless in last year's competition! I feel like Vajra University is holding back a fierce grudge and wants to make us pay!

Mo Shangjin observed the blazing fighting spirit radiating from Vajra University's team members and sighed, "I didn't know I wouldn't be able to compete this year!"

"Besides, the department was bidding for a project back then. Teacher Gao wanted me to make a flashy move to drum up publicity for our proposal!"

"Do you think I actually wanted to use the Seven Absolutes Bionic to activate the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power? That's incredibly expensive, you know!"

Just then, Chan Rong, watching Zhang Yu who was privately chatting with Mo Shangjin, noticed Zhang Yu's shifting gaze. "Mo Shangjin," Chan Rong said, "are you projecting yourself here through the Spirit Realm?"

Zhang Yu froze momentarily, unsure how to respond. Before he could speak, Chan Rong continued, "Mo Shangjin, last year, your attack nearly destroyed all our team's Bionics and magical artifacts!"

Hearing this, Zhang Yu felt a chill run down his spine. This feud has escalated beyond belief! he thought.

Chan Rong pressed on, "Today, you'll watch me deal with your teammates personally!"

Mo Shangjin frowned at Chan Rong. "Be careful," he warned. "This guy came prepared!"

---

3!

2! 

1!

As the match officially began, Chan Rong shot into the sky, flames erupting from his body. He hung above the arena like a miniature sun.

Each word dripping with malice, Chan Rong declared, "Mo Shangjin, when you defeated me last year, I had already earned my Military Certificate!"

"But my cultivation was lacking. I hadn't yet mastered the Great Sun Manifestations!"

"If last year's competition had been extended like this year's, giving me more time to cultivate, we would never have lost to you!"

"Today, I'll deal with your teammates first. Let's settle this next year!"

With that, Chan Rong clasped his hands together, and his Gang Qi erupted violently, bathing the entire arena in an endless blaze of scorching light!

Simultaneously, almost as Chan Rong moved, spoke, and channeled his energy, Mo Shangjin's intelligence on the Great Sun Manifestations flashed through the minds of Zhang Yu's team.

Mo Shangjin: "The Great Sun Manifestations is a martial art that condenses the essence of the Great Sun Martial Dao and combines it with the Great Sun Gang Qi!"

"When cultivated to completion during the Foundation Establishment stage, this military-grade martial art transforms its user into a living sun. It can gradually raise the temperature within a kilometer's radius, incinerating everything within fifteen minutes!"

"Beyond this gradual temperature increase, the Great Sun Manifestations can also rapidly create localized temperature spikes within a hundred meters!"

"A single glance or gesture is enough to ignite a person completely!"

"The smaller the volume of space being heated, the faster the temperature will skyrocket..."

Zhang Yu, Xiao Yunji, Su Yanyang, and the others possessed lightning-fast minds and reflexes. Almost before Chan Rong could finish speaking, they had already recalled all the information they knew about the Great Sun Manifestations!

But as they considered their next move, hesitation and conflicting thoughts arose.

Their opponent wielded military-grade power. Should they surrender immediately? If they did, should they act unilaterally and be the first to yield without consulting the others?

The thought flashed through Su Yanyang's mind.

In the next instant, relying on his extraordinary reflexes and mental speed, he opened the Contest Group in his Bionic Eye.

Within the Contest Group:

Su Yanyang: What do we do?

Xiao Yunji: If we fight to the death, we might lose all our Bionics and face astronomical medical bills!

Li Zhen: We can't keep fighting like this! People will die!

Xiao Yunji: Then what's your suggestion?

As the messages in the Contest Group continued to refresh, Su Yanyang cursed inwardly, "At a time like this, why hasn't anyone stepped up to surrender? Is there no one with the courage to take responsibility?"
