# Chapter 490: Win-Win

In Zhang Yu's vision, a torrent of information and matter surged toward the Yin Artifact. The souls, thoughts, vital energy, and Magic Power of the factory workers were all being frantically drawn into it.

Even Zhang Yu himself felt an unsettling pull throughout his body. Had it not been for the protective aura of the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda, he might have been in serious trouble.

The crystal at the center of his forehead pulsed rhythmically, as if about to fly out at any moment.

In that instant, the Yin Artifact, its origins unknown, transformed into a black hole, ravenously devouring memories, emotions, flesh, and Magic Power...

The workers visibly withered, their bodies thinning at an alarming rate, as if turning into living skeletons.

Just then, another figure descended from the Spirit Realm.

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations said coldly, "Jade Nectar, you've gone too far."

Divine Monarch Jade Nectar laughed heartily. "So what if I have? I'll just pay the damages."

"Pay the damages..." Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations said flatly. "Very well. How much are you willing to pay?"

The next moment, to Zhang Yu's astonishment, a price increase notification popped up.

Then, he noticed everything around him began to skyrocket in price.

The factory equipment, the value of the workers, the materials scattered across the ground, even the compensation for the Junior College Students... everything was inflating wildly.

As Zhang Yu watched this scene, he felt surrounded by endless danger. One wrong step, one careless bump into something, and he could lose everything.

In the Spirit Realm, Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's voice rang out in surprise: "Old Thief Myriad Transformations, since when have you been able to control prices to this extent?"

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations replied, "Jade Nectar, this tactic is called 'bleeding your opponent dry.' You want to fight? Keep throwing money at it."

"But... do you really have the resources to outspend me?"

With a cold snort, all the strange phenomena vanished. The Yin Artifact that had threatened to devour everything disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown.

Zhang Yu felt his body lighten, returning to normal.

Only the damage to the factory buildings and equipment, and the skeletal-looking factory workers, remained as proof that what had just occurred was no illusion.

Recalling the recent surge in prices, Zhang Yu immediately used his Bionic Eye to search for information. He discovered that within the past few seconds, the entire Myriad Laws University City had experienced a violent fluctuation in prices, with prices skyrocketing before plummeting back to their original levels.

Zhang Yu gasped, finding this scene even more terrifying than witnessing Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's destruction of the factory.

"Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations can manipulate the University City's prices like this in an instant?"

"Meaning, if he wanted to, he could trigger a 3rd-tier? 5th-tier? or even higher-level Financial Storm in the city with a mere thought, bankrupting countless people..."

"And if two Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs from different universities clashed, how much economic chaos would they unleash? How many lives would be destroyed?"

"No wonder the Ten Greats rarely engage in direct conflict. If they truly went to war, the intensity would be unimaginable."

Just imagining it sent a chill down Zhang Yu's spine.

This wasn't merely a matter of avoiding the battlefield. The interconnectedness of the Spirit Realm and the economy meant that even those far from the fighting could be financially ruined by the clashes between Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs.

Zhang Yu couldn't help but recall Lady Fortune's words: "When you start your own company, it won't be you serving the company, but rather the employees and the company itself serving you. They'll handle the trivial tasks, allowing you to focus on more important matters. You are the company's greatest asset."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Could the same be true of universities? Is it not the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs who serve the universities, but rather the universities that serve the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs?"

"If the Ten Great Sects and the Heavenly Court weren't looming over them, the universities... might look entirely different."

Just then, a voice suddenly echoed in Zhang Yu's mind.

"Everything the factory just produced... it's all ruined."

Zhang Yu froze for a moment, then realized the voice was coming from the crystal embedded in his forehead.

As Zhang Yu pondered what to do, the voice continued, "Why would they destroy something we worked so hard to make, even working overtime?"

Zhang Yu thought, "Well, they'll have to pay for it."

As if hearing his thoughts, the voice retorted, "Pay? Will she actually repair this place?"

Zhang Yu's heart jolted. "You can hear my thoughts?"

The voice pressed on, "Will she repair it?"

Zhang Yu didn't want to answer, but his thoughts raced on: "How could Divine Monarch Jade Nectar personally repair this? She must have paid compensation."

The Jade Nectar Maiden pressed, "Where did the money come from?"

Zhang Yu desperately wanted to avoid answering, yet his mind involuntarily churned out an answer: "She earned it through work."

Jade Nectar Maiden: "So Divine Monarch Jade Nectar also works? She works somewhere else, earns money, and uses it to compensate for the labor of others?"

Zhang Yu remained silent, his mind swirling with contradictions and uncertainties: "Divine Monarch Jade Nectar might need to work, but it's also unlikely. Whatever her work is, it's definitely different from ours."

Jade Nectar Maiden: "If Divine Monarch Jade Nectar doesn't need to work, where did the compensation money come from? Who is actually repairing the damage here?"

Zhang Yu thought helplessly, "Stop asking! How would I know?"

Recalling the recent Soul Transformation battle, Zhang Yu felt a surge of irritation.

"I just got permission to leave campus. Will Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's actions keep me stuck here again?"

Just then, True Monarch Magnetic Pole approached Zhang Yu and asked, "Are you alright?"

"I'm fine physically," Zhang Yu replied.

After a moment's hesitation, he pointed to the space between his eyebrows. "But... there seems to be a voice suddenly speaking to me from inside this thing."

With Zhang Pianpian's technical support, Zhang Yu could communicate directly with the Jade Nectar Maiden within the Yin Artifact, bypassing the need for this mental channel.

However, if he didn't report the Yin Artifact's anomaly now, True Monarch Magnetic Pole might discover it later during her inspection, which would only raise suspicion.

Hearing Zhang Yu's words, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's expression shifted slightly. She performed a series of Daoist hand seals, and strands of Talisman emerged in the Spirit Realm, coiling around the rhomboid crystal like chains.

In the next instant, Zhang Yu felt the crystal between his eyebrows lose all its spiritual energy and fall off, which True Monarch Magnetic Pole caught in her hand.

"The Soul Transformation Divine Monarch's actions earlier might have affected this Yin Artifact," she warned. "I'll seal it completely for now. Come to the laboratory with me later for a thorough examination. If you notice anything unusual about your body, tell me immediately."

After hours of testing, Zhang Yu finally emerged from the research institute.

No abnormalities were detected in his body, but Zhang Yu still needed to remain vigilant.

What Zhang Yu was most grateful for was that True Monarch Magnetic Pole had informed him he could continue working off-campus or participate in competitions.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole had said calmly, "The Divine Monarch told me to tell you not to be afraid. If you want to leave campus, then leave."

"If you cower here, wouldn't outsiders think Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations lost to Divine Monarch Jade Nectar? They might even believe he's afraid of her, which is why he won't let you go out."

Shortly after, news broke from Joyful Union University that Divine Monarch Jade Nectar had descended upon Myriad Laws University, reclaimed her Yin Artifact, and captured the thief who stole it.

Lady Fortune sighed, "Ah, Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs are the universities' public image. Every move they make affects the prices of virtual currencies, stocks, and futures."

"Especially since the Jade Nectar Coin recently crashed. Divine Monarch Jade Nectar would never admit defeat; she'll insist she won."

Soon after Joyful Union University's announcement, Myriad Laws University issued its own statement, declaring that under Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations' protection, the University City had suffered no losses whatsoever.

Lady Fortune sighed, "In student competitions, it's fine to admit defeat or surrender when necessary."

"But in the Soul Transformation realm, even after a crushing defeat, you must never concede verbally. If you admit defeat, your coin and stock prices will plummet, resulting in losses far greater than those suffered in the actual battle."

"A Soul Transformation Divine Monarch must win, and can only win."

Zhang Yu frowned. "Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations wants me to continue operating outside the university. But won't Divine Monarch Jade Nectar seize another opportunity to strike?"

Lady Fortune pondered for a moment before replying, "This conflict was triggered by a Soul Transformation Yin Artifact, which drew Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's attention. You alone likely wouldn't warrant a direct intervention from a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch."

"Moreover, Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's actions will undoubtedly cause ripples among the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs. She'll likely be hesitant to act rashly in the future, while Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations will likely increase the level of protection afforded to you."

Zhang Yu said, "After Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's attack, no matter how Myriad Laws University tries to explain it, other universities will likely assume our technological breakthroughs stem from Joyful Union University's Yin Artifacts, right?"

Lady Fortune chuckled. "Heh heh, now the rumors of false advertising have been completely debunked. All the other universities believe you truly stole Joyful Union University's technology. Mass production is just a matter of time."

She continued, analyzing the situation. "Speaking of this conflict, it seems to have disrupted the delicate balance among the Ten Great Universities."

"And... you were lured there by an artifact spirit controlled by the Dual Rest Cult. Could Divine Monarch Jade Nectar have been lured there by the same cult? The Dual Rest Cult is incredibly audacious! Are they deliberately provoking conflict among the Ten Great Universities?"

"This University War... it feels like someone is constantly pushing it forward."

The dynamics among the Ten Great Universities, the ambitions of Soul Transformation cultivators, the trajectory of the University War... these matters remained distant concerns for Zhang Yu at this stage.

In the days that followed, he continued to immerse himself in study and cultivation, preparing for the Civil Engineering Competition, his transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department, and, most importantly, his future entrance into a Sect. He dedicated himself wholeheartedly to these preparations.

120th floor of University City.

Fu Xinyao walked down the street, mentally replaying the events: "After my tip-off last time, the Divine Monarch descended using another hidden Soul Transformation Yin Artifact and wreaked havoc in Myriad Laws University City before escaping unscathed."

"Now I need to stay here and continue gathering intelligence..."

Just then, Ping Han said, "That person's name is Ji Yuanshu. He's also Zhang Yu's classmate."

Having learned from her previous mistake, Fu Xinyao approached Ji Yuanshu and said, "Excuse me, classmate. Are you interested in a free service?"
