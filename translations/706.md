# Chapter 706: Let Severing Clouds Suffer, I'll Take the Blame

Staring at Zhang Yu's profile picture in his contacts, Divine Monarch Blade Commander hesitated before reaching out, his mind racing.

Simultaneously, lines of information from the Spirit Realm scrolled across his Bionic Eye.

Though the other four Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs at Heavenly Sword University had refused to supply components for his flying sword factories, Divine Monarch Blade Commander was unwilling to halt production.

His interconnected industrial chain meant that shutting down the flying sword factories would cripple related sectors: transportation, warehousing, sales, military equipment — every industry, large and small, would suffer.

He refused to halt production until absolutely necessary.

Yet positioning modules, navigation modules, and other critical components were essential for flying swords. Without them, remote flight, remote sword technique execution, and remote control of sword qi and sword light would be impossible.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander could refine these components himself in his laboratory, but small-scale laboratory production was no match for the factory's mass production capabilities.

Even after mastering mass production techniques, he would need to rebuild the entire production line, secure raw material imports, and establish warehousing and logistics — a series of time-consuming and costly endeavors.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander knew this was similar to the earlier problem with insufficient Void Soil production — it couldn't be resolved with a mere thought.

Thus, his Bionic Eye now displayed information about various external university factories and component suppliers.

But a flicker of disappointment soon crossed his eyes.

"Heavenly Sword's industries have already squeezed costs to the absolute limit. Combined with their internal logistics advantages, external factories simply can't compete..."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander understood that his own factory's flying swords had always relied on Heavenly Sword University's comprehensive sword artifact supply chain to drive down costs and engage in low-price dumping.

If using external university factories' components raised costs and prices, the resulting products might even incur losses.

Ideas surfaced in his mind, only to be rejected one after another.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander felt as if an invisible, colossal hand was stirring the winds of this upheaval while simultaneously pressing down on him. It had precisely calculated his weaknesses and escape routes, leaving him powerless to act. Despite his Soul Transformation Realm cultivation, he found himself unable to exert any force.

With these thoughts, Divine Monarch Blade Commander's gaze swept over Zhang Yu's avatar once more.

"Could he be involved?"

"Zhang Yu?"

As a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch, Blade Commander's eyes instantly accessed a wealth of related information. He keenly sensed that the entire affair seemed subtly connected to Zhang Yu.

This suspicion deepened when he recalled the principal's words about the Seven Emotions Sword Repository, Bai Zhenzhen's detention, and the "business environment."

Just then, Principal Broken Radiance Divine Lord sent another message, urging him to "eliminate outdated production capacity," "invest in emerging industries," and "keep pace with the future of Immortal Dao Technology."

Though the principal's words were veiled, Blade Commander could feel the underlying pressure in every line.

After a moment's contemplation, Blade Commander sighed deeply.

Instead of contacting Zhang Yu directly, he scanned his contacts list, his gaze finally settling on his disciple, True Monarch Severing Clouds, who was overseeing the Sword Repository's operations.

"Severing Clouds... I'm afraid I must burden you with this task and let you bear the blame."

---

True Monarch Severing Clouds was in excellent spirits.

Or rather, he had been in excellent spirits ever since his Master broke through to the Soul Transformation Realm.

In his heart, he thought, "Who says war makes things difficult and life harder? I think life's pretty good, actually. It's getting better all the time."

Without the Righteous Gods' oversight and with the backing of Heavenly Sword University and a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch, True Monarch Severing Clouds had suddenly gained immense power and influence within the university's campus.

Whether it was embezzling and seizing territory during the reclamation of lost lands or exploiting his authority to amass wealth during the Third Layer campaigns, his Immortal Dao Potential had soared, propelling him to the top among the many Nascent Soul True Monarchs at Heavenly Sword University.

Take, for example, the matter of handling Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' Sword Repository. He meticulously categorized and compiled the names, specifications, origins, and other details of each sword artifact recorded in the university's archives into a comprehensive catalog, which he then released to the public.

Apart from the portion reserved for sale to Netherworld University, nearly every sword artifact had already been pre-ordered.

True Monarch Severing Clouds wasn't in a hurry to finalize the deals. He planned to wait a bit longer, letting the buyers compete further to maximize the profits from liquidating the Sword Repository.

After all, every cultivator involved in handling this matter would take their cut. The more they earned, the more everyone would share, keeping both the upper and lower ranks, as well as the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, satisfied. This would also allow him to personally benefit even more.

True Monarch Severing Clouds had handled similar matters countless times since the Great Upheaval, making it second nature to him. If he hadn't been so adept at amassing wealth for the Divine Monarchs, he wouldn't have risen so quickly among the disciples.

"Helping Master make money is the best way to strengthen our master-disciple bond," he thought.

As for the Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' influence... An old Divine Monarch who had disappeared with the Sixth Layer, their fate unknown and return uncertain, couldn't possibly compare to the new Divine Monarchs currently at Heavenly Sword University.

And Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu's friendship held even less weight in True Monarch Severing Clouds' eyes.

"This is Heavenly Sword," he thought. "Myriad Laws' reach can't extend here."

With a similar sigh, True Monarch Severing Clouds' consciousness connected to the Spirit Realm, resuming his official duties.

At the same time, he began browsing Heavenly Sword University's internal news network, gathering information, observing the Divine Monarchs' intentions, and speculating on their thoughts — a daily routine.

Suddenly, his gaze sharpened slightly as he noticed a news article with little traction:

"Former University Prodigy Detained..."

True Monarch Severing Clouds was initially puzzled by the headline, but when he read about the "violent dismantling of the Seven Emotions Sword Repository," his heart sank slightly.

"What kind of reporting is this? Does the author even understand the situation? The Sword Repository project is part of the university's plan, a strategic move by the Divine Monarchs. How dare they criticize it so recklessly?"

Sensing something amiss, True Monarch Severing Clouds considered contacting the news network's editor to demand an explanation. After a moment's thought, however, he decided against hasty action and instead began searching for other related news articles.

He then noticed that related news articles were being updated more frequently, with increasingly high-ranking figures making statements. The articles were also gaining traction and visibility across Heavenly Sword University's news websites and social media platforms.

"Former Top 4 Competitor in Ten Greats League Missing? When Will Workplace Bullying End?"

"Does the Seven Emotions Sword Repository Belong to the University? Senior Law Professor Claims Sword Repository is Standard Private Property..."

"Campus Regulatory Authorities Emphasize Commitment to Upholding Justice and Righteousness, Vowing Zero Tolerance for Cultivators Abusing Their Authority..."

When True Monarch Severing Clouds saw the words "Regulatory Authorities," his bionic eye twitched, as if freezing for a fraction of a second.

"Hah..."

He took a deep breath, scanning the timestamps and platforms of the news updates. He realized everything had occurred within the past few hours.

In just a few hours, every news platform and media account at Heavenly Sword University had reported on the Seven Emotions Sword Repository incident.

Who wielded such power? Such influence? Who could control so many platforms in such a short time?

A Soul Transformation Divine Monarch? Which vice-principal? Or the principal himself?

"Is that really necessary? If any Divine Monarch had concerns, they could simply send a disciple to contact me directly. Would I refuse to make changes?"

Yet even now, his Master, Divine Monarch Blade Commander, had not contacted him.

As this thought struck him, True Monarch Severing Clouds felt his fear growing.

No matter how hard he racked his brains, he could never have imagined that Zhang Yu had merely traced his fingertip across the design blueprint of the Great Void Cloud Repository, causing the technological tsunami that was about to sweep across the world, engulfing countless Soul Transformation cultivators and the interests of entire universities... to shift by a mere few inches.

Before this earth-shattering tide, even a Nascent Soul True Monarch like himself, a Soul Transformation disciple of Heavenly Sword University, would be crushed instantly, utterly powerless to resist.

Suddenly, Severing Clouds noticed that his connection to the Spirit Realm was growing increasingly slow and unstable, as if some force were enveloping him, severing his link to the outside world.

"They're cutting off my Spirit Realm signal?"

At that moment, Severing Clouds felt like a fish trapped in a tightening net, his despair growing with each constriction, yet utterly helpless to escape.

Although the Spirit Realm signal was gradually weakening, it wasn't cut off abruptly, indicating that whoever was behind this was giving him some time.

True Monarch Severing Clouds understood exactly what this meant. Over the past year, he had overseen the Spirit Realm management department at Heavenly Sword University and had done similar things to many others.

This was his chance to quickly contact anyone he could and settle any urgent matters before the signal was completely severed.

True Monarch Severing Clouds immediately contacted his Master, Divine Monarch Blade Commander.

True Monarch Severing Clouds: Master! Save me!

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: You should know what to say and what not to say.

Seeing this reply, True Monarch Severing Clouds couldn't help but tremble.

True Monarch Severing Clouds: Master, is there truly no chance for me?

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: Handle your personal information carefully. Don't let anything come to light that could bankrupt you.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: Wait a few years until the heat dies down, and I'll help you emerge from hiding.

A few years? The Heavenly Court was set to return in just half a year! By then, his fate would be decided by the Righteous Gods of the Heavenly Court themselves!

Could Master protect him then? Even if she could, would she be willing to pay the price?

True Monarch Severing Clouds' Nascent Soul frantically leaped out of his body, pacing around him in a mixture of fear and anxiety.

True Monarch Severing Clouds continued sending messages: Master, everyone supported this plan! Why are you all blaming me now?

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: The Great Upheaval is upon us. With the school's survival at stake, everyone must contribute. Stop dwelling on personal gains and losses.

Divine Monarch Blade Commander: Dealing with your case is the will of the masses. All five Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs of the school, including myself, have already stated their positions. Don't cling to the illusion that you can continue acting recklessly just because you're a Soul Transformation disciple.

Reading Divine Monarch Blade Commander's reply, True Monarch Severing Clouds let out a bitter laugh. He had said similar words to Bai Zhenzhen before, never imagining they would be used against him so soon.

And all five Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs had stated their positions?

"You people are overestimating me! Do you really need five Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs to deal with a mere Nascent Soul True Monarch?"

At that moment, True Monarch Severing Clouds felt like a fly that had just stolen a bite of dung, only to be crushed by a mountain, shattering his organs and shaking his very soul.

True Monarch Severing Clouds couldn't help but ask: Master, at least tell me who I've offended?
