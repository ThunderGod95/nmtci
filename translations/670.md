# Chapter 670: Sorry, I Just Want to Reach Nascent Soul

With the onset of mass unemployment, the disappearance of the Righteous Gods, and the resulting shortages of supplies, pressure within University City surged, leading to a rise in crime and an increase in incidents involving the Demonic Sect and Evil Gods.

Consequently, the Talisman Department grew increasingly vital. Though the Righteous Gods had vanished, the Spirit Realm and the divine power network remained intact.

This was a disaster for cultivators with weak talisman skills, but for talisman masters capable of crafting their own Secret Talismans and possessing a deep understanding of the divine power network and the Spirit Realm, it was the dawn of a golden age.

Without the Righteous Gods' oversight, they roamed freely through the Spirit Realm, using talismans to manipulate the divine power network and interfere with the material world.

Zhang Pianpian, a prodigy in the art of talismans and a cultivator in the Golden Core Realm, thrived in this environment, like a fish in water.

Zhang Yu knew that the Supreme Clarity Realm provided by the Great Purity Talisman had been instrumental in her success, repeatedly helping her evade Evil Gods and even talisman attacks from Nascent Soul cultivators within the Spirit Realm.

Moreover, his past experiences with simulated artifact crafting and accelerated learning in the Spirit Realm had greatly enhanced his knowledge of artifact refinement, fueling his anticipation for upgrading the Dao Seed's level.

Yet, at this moment, he remained hesitant.

"Should I spend 1,000 Spirit Coins to upgrade the Great Purity Talisman?"

"After this period of cultivation, my savings are currently at 700 Spirit Coins. If I borrow another 300 Spirit Coins for my sister..."

Zhang Yu knew he could afford the 1,000 Spirit Coins, but spending it would leave him with virtually no savings, severely hindering his cultivation progress.

"My primary focus should still be advancing my cultivation."

"Or... should I borrow from the Teachers?"

"But if they ask why I'm broke and trace it back to my sister, it would create unnecessary complications..."

Suppressing these distracting thoughts, Zhang Yu resolved, "Enough overthinking."

"Continuing to advance my cultivation is what I should be doing now. Everything else... can wait."

"There will be other opportunities to upgrade the Great Purity Talisman later."

Having suppressed the temptation to upgrade the Great Purity Talisman, Zhang Yu once again fully immersed himself in his cultivation.

Ye Xingli: Junior Brother, want to stream together?

Following the Great Upheaval, logistics and transportation could only operate during daylight hours and required extensive security measures, causing logistics costs to skyrocket. Shopping in the Spirit Realm was no longer the preferred choice for most people.

Coupled with soaring prices and declining incomes, the willingness of live stream viewers to pay for content plummeted, severely impacting Ye Xingli's Vocational College fans.

Ye Xingli had since adjusted her streaming strategy, focusing primarily on local audiences within Myriad Laws University City.

Zhang Yu, seeing Ye Xingli's invitation, knew that with his popularity as the Ten Great League Champion, he could likely achieve significant success if he dedicated himself to live streaming.

Moreover, Ye Xingli's Dao Seed Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart possessed the ability to fuse Artifact Refinement Diagrams, which had greatly assisted him in the past.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "To upgrade the Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart to Level 2, I'll need to collaborate with Senior Sister to design ten Foundation Establishment-level artifact refinement products."

For Zhang Yu at his current skill level, this task was naturally effortless.

The allure of upgrading the Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart again filled Zhang Yu with anticipation.

What new capabilities would a Level 2 Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart unlock?

Would it be able to fuse more diagrams? Offer greater flexibility in fusion directions? Allow the creation of higher-grade magical artifacts?

The potential profits and the boost to his cultivation strength both deeply appealed to Zhang Yu.

After a moment's contemplation, however, Zhang Yu suppressed the temptation to upgrade his Dao Seed.

"I can't afford to be distracted," he resolved. "My current priority is breaking through to the Nascent Soul realm. Everything else can wait."

Zhang Yu: I'm sorry, Senior Sister. I need to focus solely on my cultivation for now.

---

In his bedroom, Zhang Yu's body radiated intense heat. As his magic power and flesh intertwined, the circulation of his vital energy continuously generated heat, transforming the entire room into an oven.

Within Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye, an advertisement reappeared, showcasing custom-made Bionic Eyes specifically designed for Golden Core Cultivators.

To be honest, ever since he had advanced to the Golden Core Realm, his dao heart had strengthened, and his mental processing power had increased, he had increasingly felt that his current Level 20 Nine Nether Demon Eye was inadequate. At times, it even lagged behind his thought speed, causing noticeable stuttering.

Similarly, other artifacts like the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword, and Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor all gave Zhang Yu the same impression.

Especially as his physical strength continued to grow, he felt the fragility of these Level 20 magical artifacts more acutely.

"After all, these are still Foundation Establishment-level items. How can I truly enjoy them when I'm using Golden Core-level cultivation to power them?"

At times, Zhang Yu couldn't resist the urge to dedicate time to improving his artifact refinement skills. He wanted to upgrade his Bionic Eye and various magical artifacts to at least the Level 21 Golden Core standard, enhancing his quality of life and earning potential.

This feeling made his entire being itch, like seeing a screen full of red notification dots and having to resist clicking them.

"No..."

"The Dao Seed requires time and resources, and so do magical artifacts... My time and resources are limited. If I give in to every temptation and try to do everything at once, how can I focus on advancing my cultivation?"

"I must break through to the Nascent Soul Realm."

"Everything else... can wait."

Suppressing his distractions and fortifying his dao heart, Zhang Yu fully immersed himself in his cultivation.

---

Several days later, at noon.

As the sun stood at its zenith and the Spirit Realm signal reached its peak, Bai Zhenzhen, far away at Heavenly Sword University, initiated a communication request with Zhang Yu.

Looking at Bai Zhenzhen's projected image, Zhang Yu asked, "A-Zhen, are you alright over there?"

"What could possibly go wrong?" Bai Zhenzhen laughed heartily. "Your classmate Ying Xin boasted that 'ten years of diligent study can't compare to the ancestral tomb's six generations of rising smoke.' Well, now I have the ancestral tomb's smoke from a hundred generations of my sect! How many at Heavenly Sword University can rival me?"

Zhang Yu knew that Bai Zhenzhen's "sect ancestral tomb" referred to the Sword Pavilion left behind by Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, which housed flying swords formed from the remains of generations of Extreme Emotion Sword Dao practitioners.

Bai Zhenzhen sighed wistfully. "Yu Zi, you now have the backing of two Soul Transformation Teachers, while I command the ancestral tomb of the Soul Transformation lineage."

"Back in high school, who could have imagined we'd achieve such heights today?"

After chatting for about ten minutes, Zhang Yu noticed an alarm flashing in his Bionic Eye. With an apologetic look, he said to Bai Zhenzhen, "A-Zhen, I need to cultivate now."

Bai Zhenzhen paused briefly, then nodded. "Alright, go ahead."

As Zhang Yu's figure disappeared, the smile gradually faded from Bai Zhenzhen's face.

Wen Wuya approached her and said, "A-Zhen, have you made up your mind? You can't hold onto the Sword Pavilion alone. Why not give some of it to the principal?"

Wen Wuya looked at Bai Zhenzhen with a hint of envy. Unlike the Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, his master, the Divine Monarch Heavenly Star, had more than just one living disciple.

Moreover, until he lost contact, the Divine Monarch Heavenly Star had left no assets to anyone, only adding dozens of layers of seals that the new Soul Transformation cultivators at Heavenly Sword University were still struggling to break.

Hearing Wen Wuya's words, Bai Zhenzhen took a deep breath and replied, "Let me think about it some more."

Several more days passed. Zhang Yu's former teacher, Director Gao of the Civil Engineering Department (now Vice-Principal Gao of Myriad Laws University), sent him an inquiry.

Principal Gao: Zhang Yu, how's your cultivation with Kunlun in the Palm progressing?

Zhang Yu: It's going well.

Zhang Yu avoided revealing any specific progress to Principal Gao, as he had no intention of diverting his energy into researching spatial technology.

A few days later, True Monarch String Tone messaged him, asking about the teaching materials.

Zhang Yu gave a perfunctory reply, simply stating that he was studying.

Yu Xinghan and the others at the construction site sent an urgent request for assistance, needing his help with a major project.

Zhang Yu asked Mo Shangjin, who had just obtained his Golden Core Certificate and broken through to the Golden Core Realm, to assist them.

He himself remained in his dormitory, focusing solely on cultivation.

Earning money, magical artifacts, Dao Seeds... Zhang Yu temporarily abandoned all other pursuits.

Social engagements, work responsibilities, and even academic studies were compressed or outright abandoned.

He suppressed all temptations and rejected every distraction, dedicating himself entirely to his cultivation.

Cultivation, cultivation, cultivation!

This could be considered Zhang Yu's most focused cultivation session since embarking on the path of the Immortal Dao, ever since he acquired the Feather Book.

The results were astonishing.

By early January, a mere month had passed, yet his foundational stats had surged once again.

His dao heart reached Level 24 (11.71%), his physical strength climbed to Level 26.25, and his Magic Power reached 3,295 units.

Moreover, after exhausting the three types of Dao Foundation Potions seized from the factory, Zhang Yu personally purchased new ones.

The Physical Expression Factor grew increasingly active, allowing him to establish the third layer of his Dao Foundation: Abyss-like Gang Qi, and the fourth layer Dao Foundation: Indestructible Body.

The former, by merging his physical body and Magic Power, dramatically extended his Gang Qi transmission range from 100 meters to 200 meters. This enhanced range and density not only bolstered his defenses but also amplified his ability to manipulate the material world.

The latter, the Dao Foundation: Indestructible Body, was simpler. Through the fusion of Magic Power, it further strengthened his bones, infusing them with a resilient elasticity that allowed them to better withstand various impacts and pressures.

"In addition to the fundamental requirements, a Nascent Soul Breakthrough requires activating at least ten layers of Dao Foundation and at least eight Extraordinary Meridians."

"Opening the Extraordinary Meridians can wait, but establishing the Dao Foundation is just a matter of buying the right potions. I might as well do that now."

However, Zhang Yu soon realized that as the gap between his dao heart and physical strength widened, his control over his physical body was deteriorating.

"I need to adjust my cultivation schedule," he thought. "I should reduce the time spent on physical body cultivation and invest more resources into cultivating my dao heart."

Zhang Yu understood that if the gap between his dao heart and physical body levels grew too large, his control over his physical body would continue to weaken, diminishing the effectiveness of his cultivation and ultimately hindering his progress toward the Nascent Soul Breakthrough.

Thus, after a long absence, Zhang Yu returned to the Hammerheart Pavilion, ready to temper his dao heart once more.

The Hammerheart Pavilion had undergone significant changes. With the disappearance of the Righteous God, the Spirit Realm's computational power at Myriad Laws University had become more expensive, reducing the pavilion's efficiency, decreasing the number of available slots, and increasing prices.

However, as the principal's disciple, Zhang Yu had no trouble cutting the line and securing a slot. He also received a substantial discount, though he still had to pay.

Zhang Yu had asked his sister, Zhang Pianpian, if the Supreme Clarity Realm could be used to temper his dao heart. She explained that the Hammerheart Pavilion relied on the company's massive database, and the Supreme Clarity Realm could only achieve similar results by acquiring that database.

Focused on his cultivation, Zhang Yu continued to spend money. Gradually, his savings dwindled to around 400 Spirit Coins.

Just as his funds were dwindling, True Monarch Azure Void contacted him.

Looking at the True Monarch's projection, Zhang Yu asked, "True Monarch, what can I do for you?"

True Monarch Azure Void chuckled. "There are a few matters I'd like to ask for your assistance with, Student Zhang Yu."

Sensing the Nascent Soul True Monarch's surprising respect, Zhang Yu quickly replied, "You're a Nascent Soul, and I'm only a Golden Core. How could I possibly help you?"

True Monarch Azure Void countered, "Who doesn't know that Student Zhang Yu is a Dual Soul Transformation prodigy at Myriad Laws University? You're the treasured disciple jointly nurtured by Principal Magnetic Pole and Principal Greenwood, the Crown Prince of Myriad Laws..."

Zhang Yu, feeling somewhat embarrassed by the other party's effusive praise, quickly interrupted him to inquire about his true purpose.

True Monarch Azure Void replied, "My subordinates also have a construction team. However, as someone trained in daoist arts, I lack expertise in civil engineering."

"Therefore, I'd like to ask Student Zhang Yu to help me secure more projects..."

Zhang Yu knew that with the Civil Engineering Department's surging popularity, infrastructure projects were constantly breaking ground, and increasingly, experts from other departments were joining in to profit.

The Dao Techniques Department Head starting a civil engineering company seemed perfectly normal to him.

What puzzled Zhang Yu was why the man had come to him.

After a brief exchange, Zhang Yu finally understood True Monarch Azure Void's intentions.

"This guy... wants my company to take on more projects and then subcontract them to him?"

"And he's offering me so much money... can he really make a profit this way?"

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "It feels like he's just here to give me money."

True Monarch Azure Void was indeed there to give him money.

In fact, True Monarch Azure Void was showering money not just on Zhang Yu, but also on Ye Xingli, Mo Shangjin, True Monarch Thunder Pole, True Monarch String Tone... almost everyone close to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood.

His goal was to integrate himself into Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's faction, strengthen his relationship with her, and improve his chances of obtaining the Soul Transformation Certificate.

As he looked at Zhang Yu, True Monarch Azure Void thought to himself, "The Nascent Soul cultivators in Talismans, Security, and Medicine, plus True Monarch Grand Harmony from the Investment Management Office... those are the only ones who might compete with me for the Soul Transformation Certificate."

"In terms of raw power, I far surpass them all."

"But because of Dao Qiankun... I need to change the impression others have of me, especially in Magnetic Pole's eyes."

If he could achieve that, flattering a mere Golden Core student like Zhang Yu wouldn't be beneath a supreme Nascent Soul True Monarch like himself.

Watching True Monarch Azure Void depart, Lady Fortune sighed, "That guy is clearly trying to curry favor with you for True Monarch Magnetic Pole. He's just like those ancient ministers who bribed the empress, concubines, and eunuchs to please the emperor."

Zhang Yu nodded in agreement, but even knowing this, he couldn't bring himself to dislike True Monarch Azure Void.

"Ah, sending money... it's the ultimate way to raise someone's favor. Even my extraordinary talent can't resist that."

After finalizing the agreement with True Monarch Azure Void, Zhang Yu gained an additional 150 Spirit Coins per month without having to deploy a single soldier.

Combined with the booming success of his own company, fueled by the flourishing Civil Engineering industry, Zhang Yu's total monthly passive income now exceeded 250 Spirit Coins. This allowed him to fully immerse himself in cultivation without financial worries.

Absolute focus, lavish spending, and earth-shattering talent propelled Zhang Yu's progress. Over the next month, all his stats continued to surge rapidly.

By early February, Zhang Yu's dao heart had reached Level 25 (62.03%), his Magic Power had increased to 3,520, and his physical strength, though its growth rate had slowed due to reduced investment, had reached Level 26.98.

The fifth layer of his Dao Foundation, Yi Wood Longevity, enhanced his resistance to various toxins, medicinal properties, and fiend energy. The sixth layer, Flawless Glazed Purity, granted him greater resistance to extreme heat.

The growth of his physical body and Magic Power had also extended the range of his Gang Qi transmission to approximately 220 meters.

The narrowing gap between his dao heart and physical strength further improved Zhang Yu's control over his physical body.

Zhang Yu gazed at his progress with satisfaction, inwardly declaring, "Just like this. Next, I'll raise both my dao heart and physical strength together until they reach the limits of the Golden Core Realm."

However, just as Zhang Yu was about to fully immerse himself in cultivation, he soon discovered that beyond the allure of profits, magical artifacts, Dao Seeds, and other temptations, other factors could also disrupt his focus.

Kuang Tianqing: Are you there?

Zhang Yu: What's up?

Kuang Tianqing: What do you think of Dao Qiankun?

Kuang Tianqing felt deeply uneasy and ominous.

Since his memories had awakened, the intense clash of values had filled him with disgust for many things.

Even after transforming back into a man, many memories lingered, refusing to fade.

Yet, to many at Heavenly Demon University, this transformation was seen as a sign of a weak dao heart and declining Immortal Dao Potential.

"Fucking hell... refusing to be turned into a woman and used by others means I lack Immortal Cultivation talent?"

"How has the Demonic Dao become like this?"

Kuang Tianqing felt both heartbroken and helpless.

The Divine Monarch Unrestrained, who had sealed his memories, had long since disappeared. He dared not reveal the secrets of his past to the new Soul Transformation cultivators without absolute certainty. For now, he could only endure the bitterness in his heart and carry on.

Beyond this personal anguish, he also worried about the current situation.

"What exactly is Dao Qiankun planning? He must know what's been happening on the second to fifth floors since he left."

Kuang Tianqing recalled Dao Qiankun's declaration at the Ten Greats League:

"Announce the existence of Reincarnation to everyone... and encourage them to die?"

"Looking at the current chaotic world, many people are dying even if they don't want to."

"So Dao Qiankun's goal is to send massive populations into reincarnation?"

Kuang Tianqing couldn't confirm this, as she didn't know which reincarnation realm the current levels 2 through 5 were connected to.

"The Six Paths of Reincarnation? The Nine Nether Reincarnation? Avici Reincarnation... Which reincarnation platform are they connected to now? And have they colluded with Dao Qiankun?"

Kuang Tianqing understood that as long as the Reincarnation System remained operational, everything remained under the Immortals' control.

No matter how the people of levels 2 through 5 fought, lived, or died, their next lives would still be mere resources for the Immortals' consumption.

"Changing minds and spreading ideologies are low-cost yet effective methods. They were once crucial for the Immortals' ideological control, but they've gradually become obsolete in the face of the Reincarnation System..."

"What's the point of changing minds? What difference does it make if they adopt different beliefs? What good are more opportunities? If the Immortal Emperors wish it, everyone's thoughts can be reverted in their next lives."

"Dao Qiankun must know this, so he's definitely made arrangements regarding reincarnation."

"This could very well be the key to the next shift in the situation."

"And Zhang Yu, the one Dao Qiankun valued and specially protected, might he know some hidden truths?"

Thus, Kuang Tianqing came to probe Zhang Yu, hoping to gauge what he knew.

Zhang Yu, of course, was completely unaware of any such matters.

After his conversation with Kuang Tianqing, he was merely pulled from his wholehearted cultivation and forced to reconsider the current state of the world.

"I can't control any of this now. All I can protect are the people around me," Zhang Yu thought, recalling his journey. "When I first entered high school, I couldn't even protect myself. I relied on A-Zhen and my sister's care to get through those early hardships."

"It wasn't until my strength grew and I reached my senior year that I could finally protect A-Zhen, my best friend."

"In university, my power and wealth increased again. I could finally lead my classmates to victory in competitions and even protect six other students during the economic crisis."

"Now, with my strength further enhanced, I can not only safeguard the employees of my company but also use the rules of the Ten Greats League to inject a trace of my will into the world's transformation..."

Reflecting on this journey, each step he had taken, Zhang Yu's understanding of Kunxu deepened.

"In Kunxu... only by becoming stronger and wealthier can one gain more freedom and indulge in greater whims."

"As their strength grows, cultivators naturally develop ambitions to reshape the world, bending its course to align with their own interests and preferences."

"From a single company to a city, a school, an entire layer of Kunxu, or even the whole of Kunxu... the greater one's power, the grander the scope of world-altering ambitions."

Reflecting on his journey, Zhang Yu gained an increasingly profound understanding of Kunxu's nature.

"The scale of change one can enact must match one's own strength."

"I dislike the current state of Kunxu, and I despise this chaotic era, but my current capabilities are limited..."

"My top priority now is to achieve a Nascent Soul Breakthrough."

Zhang Yu knew that just as advancing from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment, and from Foundation Establishment to Golden Core had made previously insurmountable tasks trivial, a breakthrough to the Nascent Soul Realm would unlock even greater possibilities.

He no longer cared about Brother Dao's schemes or the direction of this chaotic era.

At this moment, his mind was consumed by a single thought: achieving a Nascent Soul Breakthrough.

After ending his communication with Kuang Tianqing, Zhang Yu cast aside all distractions and immersed himself completely in cultivation.
