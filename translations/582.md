# Chapter 582: Zhang Yu, You're the Person I Trust Most

True Monarch Morningstar gazed deeply at his subordinate. "Why are you so focused on Yu Xinghan?"

True Person Rising Sun paused slightly. "I happened to notice him."

Feeling the True Monarch's piercing gaze, True Person Rising Sun lowered his head. After several rounds of evasive maneuvers with his superior, he still refused to reveal the truth.

True Monarch Morningstar knew that without backing from someone powerful, True Person Rising Sun would never dare to openly intercept the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

But clearly, his subordinate was determined to keep his secrets.

"Heh," True Monarch Morningstar said with a faint smile. "Since you have so much evidence, then carry on. As long as you act according to the law and regulations, the Patrol Team will be your strongest support."

Sensing the cold glint in True Monarch Morningstar's projected eyes, True Person Rising Sun knew a rift had formed between them.

But he couldn't betray his secrets, even if it meant parting ways with his superior.

Just as a flicker of hesitation crossed his mind, he forcefully suppressed it.

He thought to himself, "No matter who's backing me, the bottom line is I'm arresting someone infected with the Dual Rest Virus today. The entire process is legal and compliant. What's the problem?"

"This is clearly about protecting the school, yet because of power struggles among the higher-ups, I have to tread so carefully."

"It's just so difficult to get anything done in this world."

Whenever True Person Rising Sun thought about such matters, he couldn't help but sigh.

True Monarch Morningstar, in his eyes, was even more deeply entrenched in this cautious approach, always acting with his hands tied.

Rising Sun knew that even if he remained under Morningstar's command for another century, nothing would change. Since that was the case, it was better to part ways now.

"You're a Nascent Soul cultivator. You've already lived a full life."

"But I'm still young. I can't stop at the Golden Core Realm."

With renewed resolve, he decided that as soon as the Dual Rest Virus was confirmed in Yu Xinghan, he would immediately seal off the construction site and conduct a thorough search.

Then, he would immediately request testing and interrogation for Zhang Yu as well.

"Once I reach that point..." Rising Sun stared at a name in his contacts, took a deep breath, and continued escorting Yu Xinghan to the Patrol Team's testing point.

Meanwhile, after ending his call with True Person Rising Sun, True Monarch Morningstar immediately decided to contact the Principal of Myriad Laws University — Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution.

As the head of the Fourth Division of the Patrol Team, True Monarch Morningstar was responsible for monitoring the Demonic Sect and had direct communication privileges with Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution.

As a subordinate, he naturally prioritized reporting to his superior and maintaining timely communication.

He suspected that True Person Rising Sun's recent actions were being orchestrated by someone behind the scenes.

"Who exactly is targeting Zhang Yu? Or Magnetic Pole?"

The idea that this was simply about apprehending Dual Rest Cultists seemed utterly implausible to True Monarch Morningstar.

In his seasoned Nascent Soul perspective, all talk of duty, legal procedures, and purging the Demonic Sects ultimately boiled down to one thing: profit.

"Whether it's Myriad Laws University, giant corporations, or the Heavenly Court, they're all just frameworks set up by Immortals to distribute profits," True Monarch Morningstar mused inwardly. "There aren't that many Demonic Sect members anyway. In the end, it's always the higher-ups fighting amongst themselves."

He needed to contact Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution immediately to uncover who was warring with whom and align his stance with the Principal's.

"The Nascent Soul realm is enough for me."

As an old Nascent Soul cultivator, True Monarch Morningstar was content with his current realm. Soul Transformation or anything beyond... he had long since abandoned such aspirations.

Meanwhile, Yun Yuqing led the group back to University City in a hurry. As soon as they arrived, they rushed to the Patrol Team's Testing Point.

Seeing True Person Rising Sun sitting outside the testing chamber, Yun Yuqing hurried over and asked, "Captain, what's the situation?"

True Person Rising Sun, with his Golden Core Realm cultivation, had arrived here earlier than Yun Yuqing, even before sending his projection to escort Yu Xinghan.

But now, he replied in a low voice, "We're waiting for the results."

Yun Yuqing's face showed a hint of confusion. "Is the testing taking this long?" she wondered.

She thought that since the other party had personally delivered Yu Xinghan via projection, they should have known the results long ago.

Just as she was pondering this, a staff member approached True Person Rising Sun and announced, "The results are in."

True Person Rising Sun and Yun Yuqing turned sharply to look at the staff member, who continued, "No traces of the Dual Rest Virus were detected on the suspect."

Upon hearing this, True Person Rising Sun felt as if a heavy hammer had struck his chest.

Reluctant to accept the results, he pressed further, "Are you certain? Could there have been a flaw in the detection? Or is there something special about Yu Xinghan's body?"

The staff member replied impatiently, "We've already conducted three tests at your request. If you're still not satisfied, take him somewhere else."

Yun Yuqing's face darkened. "Captain, how could this be?"

Only then did Yun Yuqing realize it wasn't the length of the testing that was unusual, but the Captain's insistence on three separate examinations.

True Person Rising Sun strode grimly toward the interrogation room, determined to question the suspect himself.

He glared at Yu Xinghan, who sat calmly before him, and demanded coldly, "Do you frequent the construction sites of the Civil Engineering Department?"

Yu Xinghan replied casually, "I'm a student in the Civil Engineering Department. Isn't it normal for me to visit construction sites?"

As he spoke, Yu Xinghan's mind flashed back to his recent experiences.

He had initially believed he had contracted the Dual Rest Virus and would inevitably be sent to the Restraint and Rest Institute.

But then Zhang Yu arrived at the construction site. While battling Xiang Shan with magic, he had guided Yu Xinghan to an underground space hidden in the wilderness.

It seemed Zhang Yu had excavated this underground space and made preparations here before even heading to the construction site.

After his magical duel with Xiang Shan, Zhang Yu left the Heavenly Sun Radiance God behind and personally rushed to this location.

"Yu Xinghan, can I trust you?" Zhang Yu asked.

Yu Xinghan smiled. "Zhang Yu, you're the person I trust most."

"To be honest, if my original gender had been female, I would have already let you have your way with me. By now, I might even be pregnant."

Zhang Yu looked at Yu Xinghan earnestly. "First, you were infected with the virus. Then Xiang Shan seized the opportunity to attack. And now the Patrol Team is here to conduct tests. Clearly, someone has their eye on you."

"They're not just targeting you. They're trying to get to me, and even to True Monarch Magnetic Pole behind me."

"But I don't have time to waste being dragged around by them."

Yu Xinghan took a deep breath. "What do you want me to do?"

Realizing he had been drawn into this conflict, with potentially dire consequences, Yu Xinghan was even prepared to become a Soul Cultivator.

But even if he became a Soul Cultivator, he believed that as long as Zhang Yu didn't fall, there would still be a chance for them to rise again together in the future.

Where did this confidence come from? Perhaps from witnessing Zhang Yu's growth firsthand? Perhaps from their years of friendship? Or perhaps from their joint life-or-death struggle against the Demonic Sect's Golden Core True Person? After all, they were already bound together by a single rope.

To be honest, Yu Xinghan himself wasn't entirely sure about the precise details of his confidence.

He simply felt that having someone he could completely trust in this moment was a wonderful thing.

He recalled True Person Starfire's words and thought to himself, "Old man... is this what you meant by 'cherishing old bonds'?"

Zhang Yu said, "Remove all your Bionics and disconnect from the network. What happens next must remain a secret."

As he spoke, Zhang Yu had already removed one of his own Bionic Eyes.

Yu Xinghan smiled faintly. "I have so many Bionics. Help me out, will you?"

In an instant, Yu Xinghan's hands and feet had been detached.

When Zhang Yu's fingers touched his Bionic Eye, Yu Xinghan nodded. "Go ahead."

The next moment, as both Bionic Eyes were removed, Yu Xinghan felt himself plunge into complete darkness, losing all awareness of his surroundings.

Moreover, with his bionic limbs removed, Yu Xinghan's ability to interfere with the outside world had been reduced to its absolute minimum.

In this bottomless darkness, Yu Xinghan felt himself in an unprecedented state of weakness, able only to hear Zhang Yu pacing back and forth, seemingly preparing something.

Soon, however, the third eye in his mind activated, allowing him to faintly perceive his surroundings.

A moment later, some mysterious force coursed through his body, causing the Spiritual Root in his mind to tremble violently.

At the same time, Zhang Yu's voice pressed close to his ear, speaking slowly: "Yu Xinghan, what I'm about to tell you concerns both our lives. No one else must ever know."

As he listened to the intelligence about the Evil God and the ritual, Yu Xinghan's eyes widened, and an unprecedented heat seemed to ignite within his heart.

Then, the third eye in his mind grew again, as if breaking through its limits and undergoing some kind of sublimation.

"Zhang Yu, from this day forward, we either live together or die together."

---

In the interrogation room, Yu Xinghan gazed at the Golden Core True Person before him.

Under the scrutiny of his third eye, he could faintly perceive the flow of Magic Power and fluctuations of spiritual energy within the True Person's body. However, due to the vast difference in their cultivation realms, the details remained hazy, like viewing flowers through mist.

In contrast, Yun Yuqing, who shared the Foundation Establishment realm with him, seemed to have no secrets under the gaze of his third eye.

Not only could Yu Xinghan observe the circulation of Magic Power throughout her body, but he also felt that merely by watching, he could learn her current breathing technique. If he continued observing... he might even be able to enhance the technique's level.

Sensing Yu Xinghan's unwavering stare, Yun Yuqing said coldly, "Yu Xinghan, we have gathered substantial evidence. It's best if you confess honestly."

Yu Xinghan replied, "I know nothing about what you're talking about. I want to contact Director Gao."
