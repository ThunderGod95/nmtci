# Chapter 440: Reunion with President Wang, Ping Han

Kunxu, First Layer. Songyang City. Songyang High School.

In recent days, Songyang High School hosted a lecture sponsored by Purple Cloud Corporation and Purple Cloud High School.

At the school gate, a statue of Zhang Yu had been erected, reportedly donated by Le Jingchen, a Purple Cloud High School alumnus, through the corporation's dedicated channel.

On the training grounds, freshmen sat obediently alongside school leaders, physical education teachers, and other staff, all listening to Wang Hai, a national-level gold-medal physical education teacher, share advanced insights into body refinement.

"The Ten Greats — that's the pinnacle of all universities!"

"Myriad Laws University — that's the pinnacle of the Ten Greats!"

"Rumor has it that at Myriad Laws University, even a low-ranking slacker might be executed by patrolling guards!"

"Students with poor grades can't survive at Myriad Laws University!"

"But my student — your Senior Brother Zhang Yu — gained admission to Myriad Laws University!"

"Even after entering Myriad Laws University, he never stopped pushing himself. He became first in his class, ranked among the top hundred in the department-wide ranking, and recently obtained his Military Certificate!"

"They say he now earns millions every day!"

As Wang Hai recounted his story, the students below gasped in unison.

The school administrators listened intently. Though they had already heard about Le Jingchen's news through Purple Cloud, Wang Hai's firsthand account still filled them with awe.

The other physical education teachers watched Wang Hai with envy. He had become the highest-paid PE teacher in Songyang City.

Wang Hai continued, "Even when Zhang Yu was a freshman, I recognized his extraordinary potential. Not only did he seek my guidance on Body Refinement Techniques daily, but he also insisted on training his willpower without relying on performance-enhancing drugs."

"Of course, don't follow his example on that last point. Without drugs, you won't be able to keep up..."

Kunxu, Second Layer!

Myriad Laws University!

Le Jingchen read the message sent via the company's private line from the first layer. "This should suffice for now," he thought. "There's no need to actively spread these minor details. When next year's freshmen join the Songyang Hometown Group, they'll naturally share the story. Let it unfold organically."

Le Jingchen wasn't sure if this approach would work, but based on Le Mulan's description of Zhang Yu's character, he believed it had a chance. Besides, it required minimal effort — a simple, convenient gesture.

"If the opportunity arises, perhaps we could have Purple Cloud High School join Songyang High School."

"That way, Zhang Yu and I would be alumni of the same school."

Spirit Realm.

Li Xuelian flicked her finger, and a flood of chat logs from the Songyang Hometown Group materialized before her. Alongside them appeared Zhang Yu's social media posts, rumors circulating in various regions, and more.

After a moment, she turned to the projection of True Person Starfire before her. "Father, that's the situation..."

"I told you, if you'd listened to me back then and signed Zhang Yu..."

True Person Starfire's projection waved dismissively. "Enough, enough! I've heard that argument so many times, it's worn me out!"

"I rarely use Divine Travel to visit the Spirit Realm and gather news. I didn't come here to hear you repeat yourself!"

Seeing Li Xuelian about to protest, True Person Starfire quickly pointed to the chat logs. "Did Yu Xinghan send these? Why is he constantly discussing Dual Cultivation with Lian Tianji? Does he intend to cultivate with her?"

A peculiar expression flickered across Li Xuelian's face. "Perhaps!"

"Sigh, that boy..." True Person Starfire shook his head, then resumed reviewing the intelligence on Zhang Yu, a faint smile spreading across his face.

Li Xuelian watched True Person Starfire continue to smile, his expression unchanging. Finally, she asked, "Father, if Zhang Yu advances to the Golden Core stage, could he help you return?"

When True Person Starfire didn't respond, Li Xuelian frowned. She studied him closely, a hint of helplessness flickering in her eyes. "Ah, he's stuck!"

"Has he run out of Divine Travel energy?"

Netherworld University!

Wang Yin, now a successful graduate student, casually opened the video in his Bionic Eye, as he always did.

The video showed Zhang Yu's performance from last year's Civil Engineering Competition.

For the past year, Wang Yin had watched this video endlessly — day and night, while practicing his breathing technique, while taking pills... He had long since memorized every detail.

Originally, watching it had made his heart bleed and his body ache with discomfort. Now, he watched with calm indifference, his heart utterly unmoved.

He said softly, "Mother, not only has my strength returned to the peak of Foundation Establishment, but my Dao Heart has also grown as vast and steadfast as the earth itself. No failure, no humiliation, no disgrace can shake it now."

"In fact, every setback, every humiliation, will only become nourishment for my Immortal Dao, propelling me further on my path!"

His mother replied calmly, "You said the same thing last time."

"A Dao Heart is forged through trials, not mere words!"

"Do you know what people are saying about you outside?"

Wang Yin replied calmly, "What are they saying? Mother, speak freely. The more they insult me, the more my Dao Heart will be tempered!"

His mother said indifferently, "They say Wang Yin can't even mooch off his elders properly. His potential is limited, and he might never even reach the Golden Core stage."

Wang Yin's brow furrowed slightly. He fully understood the depth of this insult.

Every wealthy family has elders with extended lifespans. For their descendants, mastering the art of "mooching" off these elders — or rather, learning to leverage their resources for growth — is a crucial skill, a vital tradition passed down through generations, and a key measure of their strength.

"They're questioning my ability to mooch? How is that different from calling me unfilial?" Wang Yin sneered. His Dao Heart stirred, and boundless fighting spirit surged within him. "I'll show them just how strong my mooching skills truly are!"

His mother nodded slightly. "It seems you've indeed made progress."

"Then let's move on to Zhang Yu. I'll pose a few questions to test you. Are you ready?"

A glint flashed in Wang Yin's eyes, his fighting spirit surging. "Come on, Mom! My imperial heart has yearned for this day for a year!"

"For the past year, I've eagerly awaited this moment, transforming Zhang Yu's victories into fuel for my own advancement. This is the essence of my Yin's Doctrine!"

Wang Yin smiled confidently. "Mom, I'm not afraid to tell you this! If anyone can defeat me, I'll even give them 10 Spirit Coins!"

His mother replied, "Zhang Yu is now among the top 30 in the Civil Engineering Department at Myriad Laws University!"

Wang Yin chuckled. "As expected of my rival! He's truly made remarkable progress this past year!"

"Being in the top 30 of the Civil Engineering Department means he now has a chance to attend Netherworld University. This gives me the perfect opportunity to personally crush him!"

"How wonderful!"

His mother continued, "Zhang Yu has become the Dual Cultivation partner of a Soul Transformation disciple!"

Wang Yin paused briefly, then burst into laughter. "Dual Cultivation with a Soul Transformation disciple? That proves he has talent in that area!"

"This only makes defeating him in the future even more meaningful!"

His mother added, "He's also passed the Military Certificate exam for Cultivation Arts!"

"Pfft."

Wang Yin burst into laughter. "Mom, I know you're just making up fake news to test me!"

"But you're saying Zhang Yu got his Military Certificate in his third year?"

"That's too far-fetched! It completely defeats the purpose of the test..."

Seeing his mother's indifferent expression, Wang Yin's smile gradually faded. "Is it... true?"

With a tap of her finger, the Myriad Laws University's official news feed materialized, featuring a photo of Zhang Yu receiving his Military Certificate!

Under his mother's gaze, Wang Yin fell silent for a moment before muttering, "I can't solve this. I can't. It's too hard."

His mother shook her head coldly. "Wang Yin, you can't even mooch off your parents properly anymore!"

Just as she turned to leave, she suddenly sensed an astonishing surge of fighting spirit emanating from Wang Yin's body!

"Mom! I've told you before — the more I fail, the more I'm humiliated, the more setbacks I face, the stronger my fighting spirit will become!"

"I'm not the same person I used to be!"

His mother smiled. "Good!"

"Then do you still need the Avoidance Talisman to block all news about Zhang Yu?"

Spiritual energy surged around Wang Yin, swirling like loyal subjects bowing to his will. It coalesced, emitting a faint glow as it obeyed his command.

Wang Yin declared, "There's no need for that anymore. Even if I witnessed Zhang Yu's victories every day, it would only make me stronger."

"I could even add him as a friend myself."

His mother beamed. "Excellent! You've truly made remarkable progress this past year. You've finally mastered the Mental Cultivation Technique of the Imperial Heart!"

---

"Hmm?"

Zhang Yu's eyes flickered. "President Wang? He actually added me as a friend? Didn't he block me a while ago? Could this be a scam?"

After accepting Wang Yin's friend request, Zhang Yu confirmed with Tian Yang that it was indeed the real President Wang.

However, before he could exchange any messages, Zhang Yu hastily closed the chat window. He had more pressing matters to attend to.

Today was the Civil Engineering Competition's departmental round — the showdown between their Competition Team and Ping Han's team!

The massive Simulation Battlefield stood empty of spectators, but countless Civil Engineering students were watching the livestream.

"It's starting! It's starting!"

"Zhang Yu versus Ping Han — who truly deserves the Military Certificate?"

"Who cares about that? I'm here to see who's the better Jade Nectar Coin trader!"

"It's definitely Zhang Yu! They say he's a master of Dual Cultivation and can even become a Dual Cultivation partner with Soul Transformation disciples. His research on Jade Nectar Coins is far superior to Ping Han's!"

Before the Simulation Battlefield, the two Competition Teams stood facing each other.

Ping Han glared coldly at Zhang Yu, his eyes burning with fierce battle intent.

"You bought Jade Nectar Coins too?" he demanded.

Zhang Yu shook his head. "I don't trade coins."

Ping Han scoffed. "Those who don't trade coins are destined to be swept away by the tide of the times. What right do you have to claim the Military Certificate?"
