# Chapter 657: The True Immortal Dao Stock: Chief Engineer of the Dharma Realm

Deep within the Spirit Realm, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution and Zhang Yu stood amidst azure skies and drifting clouds, overlooking the University City of Myriad Laws University, which spanned 671 levels below.

Zhang Yu knew this wasn't the real University City, but an illusionary realm within the Spirit Realm — a simulated environment.

Beside him, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution gazed at the bustling University City below and slowly remarked, "Zhang Yu, what do you think of the University City as it is now?"

Zhang Yu pondered for a moment before replying, "The principal leads with wisdom, and the students are all striving for excellence."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution chuckled, "Ah, 'striving for excellence' — such noble words."

"The downfall of Kunxu's thirty-six levels lies precisely in those four characters: 'striving for excellence.'"

With a thought, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution shifted their surroundings. The perspective zoomed in instantly, transporting them to the very top of the 671st level.

As they watched the workers scurrying back and forth across the construction site below, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution said calmly, "Look at this construction site. Doesn't it resemble a microcosm of Kunxu — a miniature Kunxu?"

"These workers toil their entire lives, scrimping and saving every day, with only one goal in mind: to accumulate wealth, cultivate the Dao, and achieve immortality."

The light and shadows around them continued to shift. Zhang Yu followed behind Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution and saw Yu Xinghan diligently selling his wares in the Illusionary Realm, Shi Huaiyu manipulating sand and gravel, and Shi Yunxiang hauling trash.

"From birth, their lives seem to have only one purpose: to save money for Immortal cultivation."

"They deny themselves food, sleep, and rest, pouring every saved Spirit Coin into the immortal path, hoping to achieve something on that path, to live longer, and to earn even more."

"Save, invest, save, invest. They believe that by continuously investing their money, they can advance further along the immortal path."

"But when one invests 10 Spirit Coins, another invests 12. The investments escalate, the spending increases, and in the end, they're all eliminated."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution gazed at the students hauling bricks in the Illusionary Realm and said calmly, "I call these people Immortal Dao gamblers."

"They gamble on themselves, hoping to save enough to make a big bet... but they have no idea who their true opponents are."

"The Immortal Dao is a competition, and from the moment they're born, these people are destined to be eliminated by true experts."

Before Zhang Yu, he saw withered, emaciated workers constantly replacing their inferior Bionics, desperately clinging to life.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution continued, "The Dharma Realm offers everyone a chance."

"It ensures that the money they've saved their entire lives doesn't go to waste, ending up as nothing."

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened as he observed the workers clinging to life, selling their cultivation arts, their cultivation levels, and their realms through the Dharma Realm.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution explained, "These Immortal Dao gamblers never had the potential to ascend. The Dharma Realm provides them with a way out, allowing them to convert their cultivation into money and recover some of their losses."

"Meanwhile, those with genuine potential to rise can cultivate faster and climb the Immortal Dao path more quickly, competing for advancement."

"This system channels the most promising individuals in society toward cultivation, allocating resources more efficiently through market mechanisms. It also offers Immortal Dao gamblers a more suitable investment direction."

At that moment, lines of text and data materialized before the Divine Monarch and Zhang Yu's Heavenly Eye, resembling a stock market ticker.

But upon closer inspection, Zhang Yu realized the stocks weren't companies, but individuals — familiar names like Tian Shengong, Dao Qiankun, and Kuang Tianqing.

The various metrics following each name represented different dimensions for measuring the level of cultivation.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution explained, "When the Dharma Realm is established and cultivation can be transmitted through it, true Immortal Dao Stocks will be born."

"Anyone can invest their cultivation."

"Even a Junior College Student can invest their cultivation in Dao Qiankun or Kuang Tianqing, letting them manage it."

"Geniuses can rapidly accumulate cultivation and climb to higher realms."

"Gamblers can invest their cultivation in geniuses of the same realm, sharing in the profits of the geniuses' cultivation."

"Everyone will collectively drive the growth of cultivation across society, sharing in the dividends of this growth and optimizing the allocation of Kunxu's resources."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution sighed, "And these Immortal Dao Stocks are merely a small application of the Dharma Realm."

"Once the Dharma Realm is truly established, similar applications will proliferate wildly, ushering in a massive societal transformation. The development of Immortal Dao Technology will accelerate once more, leading to explosive advancements in all aspects of cultivation — cultivation levels, realms, cultivation arts, magical artifacts, Bionics... everything will experience exponential growth."

"And Zhang Yu..." Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution turned to Zhang Yu. "You can be the one to initiate all of this."

As Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution observed Zhang Yu, who was deep in thought, a faint smile appeared on his face. In his eyes, data and information swirled around Zhang Yu, coalescing into an incredibly detailed psychological profile. This would allow him to persuade Zhang Yu in the most effective way possible.

Zhang Yu, however, was deeply astonished by the Divine Monarch's explanation.

He could sense that if the Dharma Realm were to develop, it would completely shatter the current structure of the Immortal Dao. The implications and impact of such a transformation were far too vast to be summarized in a few words.

Zhang Yu had initially believed that when choosing an Immortal Sect Technique, he would face a simple dilemma: which option would be less harmful to the world, aside from his own personal gain?

But now, another thought surged through his mind: "Can I truly judge which option would be less harmful?"

"Even the Dharma Realm alone, with its potential impact on the world, involves complexities that no single person could fully comprehend."

"The proliferation of Immortal Sect Technology and its consequences... I doubt I can even begin to assess them. This isn't just about the technology itself, but also how it's applied."

At that moment, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly. He thought to himself, "The beggars have arrived."

---

Meanwhile, in another part of the Spirit Realm, an Incarnation of Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution slowly descended, gazing upon Divine Monarch Unrestrained, Divine Monarch Jade Nectar, and the assembled Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools.

"Unrestrained," Celestial Evolution said coldly, "I fear Myriad Transformations is getting old and his senses are failing. He might have misheard you or relayed your message incorrectly. Now, in front of everyone, repeat what you said to me."

Divine Monarch Unrestrained replied calmly, "Celestial Evolution, it seems your own mind is growing feeble. I'll say it again: if you insist on building the Dharma Realm, we will all join forces to crush your Myriad Great Gang."

Celestial Evolution: "Do you think the higher realms will stand by and watch you attack?"

Divine Monarch Unrestrained: "And do you think they'll stand by and watch you build the Dharma Realm?"

Within the Spirit Realm, a surging tide of data and information crashed like a tsunami.

It was a frenzied display of assets and military might, like an armed parade showcasing the wealth and combat power of both sides: countless asset data points, military strength metrics, cultivator statistics, Soul Cultivator figures...

As the data streams collided, the atmosphere grew increasingly tense, as if the next moment would trigger an economic crisis, a violent fluctuation in prices.

At that moment, divine lights representing Heavenly Sword, Vajra, and Immortal Soldiers descended simultaneously.

The principal of Immortal Armaments University chuckled. "No fighting, no fighting! How will we make money if you fight? Give me some face and let's sit down and talk."

"Hmph," Divine Monarch Unrestrained scoffed. "What benefits has Myriad Laws offered you to make you side with them?"

The principals of Heavenly Sword, Vajra, and Immortal Soldiers naturally remained silent.

But even without their explicit answers, Divine Monarch Unrestrained knew the truth: it was a simple exchange of technology for market access, joint participation in the Dharma Realm's development, and shared profits.

Meanwhile, the principals of the Four Great Colleges — Myriad Laws, Immortal Armaments, Vajra, and Heavenly Sword — were engaged in a high-speed exchange of countless messages.

Vajra University Principal, Divine Sovereign Precious Visage: Dharma Realm development is acceptable, but all data from Vajra University and its affiliated schools must remain stored locally under our control.

Heavenly Sword University Principal, Divine Monarch Heavenly Star: Divine Monarch Unrestrained is truly willing to bankrupt himself. Given the immense pressure this time, I think we need to renegotiate the equity distribution.

Divine Monarch Heavenly Star: Myriad Laws' victory was also thanks to Seven Emotions' disciple, wasn't it? She had an agreement with Myriad Laws beforehand.

Principal of Immortal Armaments University, Divine Monarch Starforge: I believe all foundational technologies in the Dharma Realm should be open-sourced.

Watching the principals' speeches, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution sneered inwardly.

Fight?

Celestial Evolution knew it wasn't time for war yet.

If the Four Heavenly Demon Schools truly intended to fight, they would launch a silent, surprise attack.

All these grandstanding maneuvers were merely using military pressure to force negotiations.

Celestial Evolution declared loudly, "The Dharma Realm remains the most suitable choice. Or do you believe that if you choose your own Immortal Sect Techniques, there won't be infighting among you?"

"Fine, let's put them all on display and see which one surpasses Myriad Laws' proposal."

Time in the Spirit Realm space accelerated rapidly as the eight Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs exchanged information at an intense pace.

Divine Monarch Unrestrained: "Impossible! Zhang Yu cannot be imprisoned by you. He must be jointly guarded by all of us, and we must have constant access to him."

"If we can't agree, let's just fight."

As Divine Monarch Unrestrained voiced his opposition, a vocational college far on the horizon exploded in a cataclysmic Financial Storm, engulfing the entire campus and reducing countless teachers and students to ashes.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution coldly retorted, "Do you not understand how critical Zhang Yu's safety is? Besides, our university's students are none of your concern."

"Fight if you dare! Bankruptcy means nothing to me. I'll fight you to your death in this life, and then chase you into the next to finish the job."

"Unrestrained, I'll spend the rest of my days doing nothing but hunting you down. Will you face me?"

As Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's threat echoed through the Spirit Realm, a torrent of information surged through the digital realm. The price of Heavenly Demon University's currency skyrocketed, triggering a catastrophic chain reaction that detonated the leveraged short positions held by countless teachers and students who had bet against the market after the finals. In that instant, countless souls ascended in pillars of divine light.

Amidst this constant cycle of battle and negotiation, negotiation and battle, competition and balance, the eight Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs gradually reached a tentative consensus.

---

Deep within the Spirit Realm, within the simulated University City of Myriad Laws University, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's Soul Transformation avatar led Zhang Yu through the construction site, explaining various aspects of the Dharma Realm as they walked.

"Zhang Yu..." Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution suddenly spoke, "After all I've told you, you must now have a profound understanding of the Dharma Realm's significance."

"And you are equally vital to the Dharma Realm."

"After all, you are the true wielder of the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm. The world needs you to cultivate, to attain higher realms and greater power, to advance the Divine Creation Chapter, to research its technologies, and to drive the Dharma Realm's development."

"To achieve this, we will spare no effort in supporting you and advancing your cultivation."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution gazed earnestly at Zhang Yu. "Only when your cultivation reaches the Golden Core, Nascent Soul, or even Soul Transformation levels can you cultivate the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm to levels 40 or 50."

"Throughout this process, you will serve as the Dharma Realm's chief engineer, the foundational architect of its first ten layers of technology."

As he spoke, the surrounding light and shadows shifted once more.

Zhang Yu's figure materialized before them. With a flick of his finger, a massive torrent of Spirit Coins surged forth, symbolizing the boundless resources pouring into all directions.

"You will command vast funds and immense resources to reshape this world."

In the luminous projection, as Zhang Yu strode forward, each gesture of his finger caused the heavens and earth to revolve in accordance with his will. Countless structures and wonders rose from the ground at his command, as if the entire world were advancing according to his design.

"The Dharma Realm will transform the world, and as its chief architect, you will become the world's designer. This unique position belongs solely to you, and no one can ever take it away."

Watching the scene unfold before him and listening to Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's words, it was impossible for Zhang Yu to remain unmoved.

He could only repeatedly tell himself to stay calm, suppressing the agitation in his heart.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution continued, "Zhang Yu, I tell you this only so you understand..."

"Compared to any benefits promised by schools or Soul Transformation cultivators, the transformative impact of an Immortal Sect Technique on society — the profits and influence it generates — represents the truly greatest advantage for you."

"In this regard, no choice surpasses the Dharma Realm."

"We don't even need a contract. I'm confident any other school could afford to pay the breach-of-contract penalties. But only the Dharma Realm offers prospects that no other school or option can match."

Zhang Yu's heart stirred. He thought to himself, "Instead of relying on a contract, they believe the information advantage they've given me today is the best guarantee?"

Zhang Yu nodded. "I understand, Principal. I'll give the Dharma Realm matter serious consideration."

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution smiled faintly. "New Immortal Dao Technologies often evoke unfamiliarity, even fear. But you must understand that in Kunxu... only by constantly embracing advanced Immortal Dao Technologies can one continue to progress."

"When the Spirit Realm and Bionics were first introduced, they faced countless attacks and resistance. They were branded as demonic and heretical, feared and hated by many, and even deliberately sabotaged by some cultivators through organized vandalism."

"But look at today. Who can live without them now?"

"The cultivators who once opposed the Spirit Realm and the Bionics have either joined them or become dust."

"The advancement of Immortal Dao Technology, whether gradual or sudden, will inevitably sweep across the world. We cultivators must either embrace it and align ourselves with the natural order, or be completely eliminated and cast into the dustbin of history."

With that, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution waved his hand. "Alright, that's all I'll say for today. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions."

A notification flashed before Zhang Yu's eyes — a friend request from Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution.

Immediately afterward, the Divine Monarch added, "Divine Monarch Seven Emotions has been waiting for you for quite some time."

"She and her disciples provided significant assistance in your final victory."

"As agreed, you are now entitled to hear her decision."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Hmm? She's letting me speak with Divine Monarch Seven Emotions so easily? Could it be... that Divine Monarch Seven Emotions caused trouble at Myriad Laws, and the two sides have already clashed?"

In the next moment, Zhang Yu's gaze flickered, and his consciousness connected to another Spirit Realm.

---

When Zhang Yu opened his eyes, he found himself in a bustling ancient city, teeming with carriages and pedestrians.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions stood beside him, saying calmly, "This is my Spirit Realm Grotto-Heaven. As for the scenery... it's shaped by my memories."

At the same time, Bai Zhenzhen stood behind Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, winking and gesturing wildly at Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu clasped his hands in a respectful bow. "Greetings, Divine Monarch. Thank you for your assistance in this battle."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions waved dismissively. "You should thank Bai Zhenzhen instead. If there weren't such foolish women in this world, I wouldn't have bothered helping you."

"Now that you've secured the Ten Greats championship, you'll need Spirit Coins no matter which cultivation art you choose. Remember to allocate a substantial portion to restoring Bai Zhenzhen's physical body."

Zhang Yu's heart sank. "A-Zhen's physical body hasn't been restored yet?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions scoffed. "Hmph, human-sword unity isn't so easily repaired. Besides, I have no money to waste on such trivial matters. Resolve your own affairs. You won't be short on funds in the future anyway."

Zhang Yu was about to press further when he noticed Bai Zhenzhen frantically waving him off from the side. Suppressing his questions, he remained silent.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions continued, "I know Myriad Laws wants you to choose the Divine Creation Chapter of the Dharma Realm cultivation art. Celestial Evolution must have showered you with endless promises of benefits."

"But once the Dharma Realm is established, won't the world descend into even greater madness and chaos?"

The Divine Monarch sighed, walking through the ancient marketplace below with Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu.

"This world wasn't always like this."

"People used to live normal lives, raising families, honoring teachers, and valuing integrity. A single promise was worth a thousand gold pieces, and there was no need for contracts or Righteous Gods."

"Now, everyone is obsessed with climbing the Immortal Dao, chasing profits, and hoarding Spirit Coins. They've become neither human nor ghost."

After a few casual remarks, the Divine Monarch shook her head and continued, "The cultivation art I want you to choose is simple... it's called the Crimson Heart Sword Manual. The 'crimson heart' refers to seeking a pure, flawless, and utterly sincere heart."

"With this Immortal Sect sword technique, you can also perfect the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, elevating it back to Immortal Sect-level."

"So, by choosing the Crimson Heart Sword Manual, you'll gain two Immortal Sect Techniques."

"Furthermore, the perfected Extreme Emotion Sword Dao will mend the flaws in Bai Zhenzhen's heart, preventing her Extreme Emotion Immortal Dao from ever spiraling out of control again."

Zhang Yu's heart stirred slightly upon hearing these words, sensing the essence of the Crimson Heart Sword Manual. Yet deeper within him lay a lingering concern and curiosity. He asked, "What impact do you believe the Immortal Dao Technology within the Crimson Heart Sword Manual will have on the world?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions sighed. "Impact... If everyone's minds could become pure and flawless, utterly sincere, and then use this purified spiritual power to master matter and reshape the world, we could sweep away the Demonic Path's influence in Kunxu and restore the moral era of the past."

"However, I don't expect you to understand these things."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions gazed at Zhang Yu. "I suspect Celestial Evolution has already told you about the Dharma Realm's countless benefits and the immense wealth it promises."

"Indeed, he spoke truthfully about those aspects. The Dharma Realm can bring you unprecedented profits, but... can you truly trust these Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs?"

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions continued smoothly, "Don't forget Celestial Evolution's signature move: counterfeiting Immortal Dao Technology. He crushes original daoist arts by flooding the market with imitations. Do you think he'll treat you any differently?"

"Moreover, Myriad Laws needs to promote the Dharma Realm, which inevitably means clashing and negotiating with the other nine universities. In the process... are you truly confident you can maneuver against those Soul Transformation cultivators?"

"Building the Dharma Realm is like seeking skin from a tiger. Even without resorting to force, they'll devour you whole, leaving nothing behind."

"But the Crimson Heart Sword Manual will grant you more trustworthy allies."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions spoke with longing, "Any cultivator who practices this art can become a trusted companion, working alongside you to reshape Kunxu. You'll share the same spirit, and to you... the rest of Kunxu will seem like demonic deviants. You'll naturally be the best allies."

With that, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' friend request arrived.

She continued, "I've said all I need to say. Now, consider your next steps carefully."

"If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me again."

Nearby, Bai Zhenzhen waved her hand and messaged Zhang Yu: Don't worry about my physical body. I can handle it myself.

Bai Zhenzhen: Yu Zi, Immortal Sect Techniques are of utmost importance. You must consider this carefully. But I think the profit margin isn't the key — safety comes first.

As the light and shadows shifted, Zhang Yu regained consciousness and found his consciousness had returned to his physical body.

Yet his mind remained preoccupied with his recent exchanges with Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution and Divine Monarch Seven Emotions.

Just then, Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution's avatar appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution: Zhang Yu, an old friend wishes to meet you and discuss matters concerning the Dharma Realm.

Zhang Yu's gaze narrowed slightly. "Are they sending someone else to tempt me with promises? Or is this another attempt to pressure me?"

He resolved inwardly that no matter who came or what pressure or benefits they offered, he would not be easily swayed. He needed more time to confirm certain things and to think things through thoroughly.

"I need more time to verify some things, to consider everything carefully..."

As Zhang Yu made this decision, Director Gao pushed open the hospital room door and entered.

Seeing his teacher's face etched with concern, Zhang Yu's resolve faltered slightly.

Director Gao's first words startled Zhang Yu.

"Zhang Yu, did Seven Emotions tell you to choose the Crimson Heart Sword Manual? You must not listen to her and select that cultivation art."
