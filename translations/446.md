# Chapter 446: Financial Storm

Cang Lanyu ranked sixth in the Talisman Department of Myriad Laws University.

His body, hands, feet, and even every strand of hair shimmered with a dazzling radiance.

This radiance originated from projections deep within the Spirit Realm, constantly converging in the eyes of anyone who looked at Cang Lanyu. Within their bionic eyes, these projections transformed into lines of cryptic text.

This was the Advertising Talisman bestowed by a Righteous God, allowing Cang Lanyu to continuously display a variety of advertisements across his entire being.

The longer someone gazed at him, the more personalized and enticing the advertisements became, radiating an increasingly powerful allure.

At that moment, he stood on a desolate plain, surrounded by Dual Cultivation Sect believers he had captured.

Sensing their furious glares, Cang Lanyu said calmly, "You fools. Did you really think sneaking into Netherworld University would land you Dual Cultivation jobs?"

"They'll sell you to an Underground Livestock Factory..."

Noticing the believers' even angrier expressions, Cang Lanyu smiled faintly, as if seeing his advertising revenue surge once more, his income growing.

For him, as long as people watched him, he was making money and getting stronger!

Just then, Zhang Pianpian contacted Cang Lanyu, saying, "I've taken care of my end!"

In a flash of thought, Cang Lanyu projected a Spirit Realm Projection beside Zhang Pianpian.

Scanning the underground base before him, Cang Lanyu mused, "Zhang Pianpian's ranking isn't high, but she's surprisingly quick!"

The next moment, Cang Lanyu's brow furrowed as he observed the subdued cultists around them. "This trace..."

He retrieved surveillance footage and recordings from the bionic eyes, and his heart skipped a beat at what he saw.

"Just as I suspected... she forcibly controlled these cultists' bionics, magical artifacts, and even their physical bodies. This is a Daoist Art from the Great Star-Shifting Divine Transformation Technique. When did she master a military-grade Talisman Department technique? I don't remember her being among those who passed the Military Certificate Examination..."

Cang Lanyu swiftly accessed Zhang Pianpian's records.

At first glance, her profile seemed ordinary. He bypassed the hidden information, only to find further classified details.

After successfully cracking the confidential section, Cang Lanyu immediately encountered a warning, sending another shock through his heart.

"A military position?"

Cang Lanyu was astonished. "What exactly is this woman's background? She has a military position directly granted by the Heavenly Court? Has she already been selected as a candidate for a Divine Body?"

Zhang Pianpian glanced at Cang Lanyu beside her and asked, "Senior Brother, have you finished reading?"

Cang Lanyu paused slightly, momentarily unsure if her words carried a hidden meaning or if she had detected his intrusion.

He even had a faint suspicion that she might be deliberately displaying the power of her Military-Grade Daoist Arts!

Zhang Pianpian continued, "From what I can see, the Dual Cultivation Sect is indeed backed by Netherworld University, but that might not be their only supporter."

"Moreover, sect members are also buying Jade Nectar Coins!"

Cang Lanyu suppressed his confusion and nodded. "How else would they afford Dual Cultivation? These fools probably believe they can invest a small amount in Jade Nectar Coins and then sustain themselves through monthly Dual Cultivation sessions."

"But I never expected the Dual Cultivation Sect itself to be promoting Jade Nectar Coins!"

Cang Lanyu stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Perhaps the Jade Nectar Coin scheme isn't just Joyful Union University's doing. Other universities like Netherworld University might also be involved!"

Zhang Pianpian mused, "If that's the case, the other universities' counterattack must be coming soon."

With this thought, Zhang Pianpian sent a message to Zhang Yu, warning her younger brother to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. In the days that followed, Zhang Yu devoted himself to his studies, working part-time, and cultivating the Dragon Vein Sensing Manual.

---

Before long, it was late November. On this particular day, Zhang Yu had advanced the Dragon Vein Sensing Manual to the 16th level!

Suddenly, a series of shouts and crashing sounds erupted from the 669th-floor construction site.

Zhang Yu turned to see a worker rampaging through the site, smashing everything in his path.

"Has he gone mad?" Zhang Yu wondered, watching the security guards subdue and drag the worker away, utterly perplexed.

But moments later, something even more astonishing occurred.

A beam of Divine Light descended from the sky, directly immobilizing another worker!

Seeing the worker's soul being forcibly extracted, Zhang Yu was shocked. "What's happening?"

But then, more Divine Light descended from the heavens, forming towering pillars that connected the earth to the sky. These beams directly guided the souls of workers to the Spirit Realm!

Zhang Yu gaped, unable to comprehend. "What in the world..."

As he hurried back to his dormitory, he repeatedly witnessed these radiant pillars falling, instantly transforming vibrant workers into lifeless corpses. The Divine Light swiftly processed and decomposed the bodies, depositing them into iron coffins that shot through the air.

Simultaneously, messages flashed across Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye:

Storm Warning: Emergency

The Financial Storm triggered by the Jade Nectar Coin is projected to reach approximately Level 1.3. Your area will experience localized debt collection.

Please avoid crowds, minimize outdoor activities, and safeguard your account funds.

Exercise caution with post-disaster investments and disregard rumors.

Myriad Laws University

Lady Fortune sighed, "The Financial Storm is here. Thankfully, it's only Level 1.3 — at most, we'll see some unrest, nothing catastrophic."

Zhang Yu asked, "What's the purpose of this warning?"

Lady Fortune explained, "It's both reassurance and deterrence, to prevent anyone from taking advantage of the chaos!"

"But that was the original intention. Now, the Righteous Gods are much more efficient and professional at handling such matters."

"A 1.3-level financial storm is far below their operational capacity. There won't be any major disruptions."

"Instead, check what's happening with the Jade Nectar Coin!"

Zhang Yu nodded and immediately used the Spirit Realm to observe the coin's situation. He saw its price plummeting like a diver.

"What's going on? Why is it crashing so suddenly?"

Zhang Yu clicked on a related news article, which read: "High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts Riot at Joyful Union University! Mass Exodus of Artifact Spirits!"

He wondered, "What does this have to do with the Jade Nectar Coin's crash?"

As he continued reading, he discovered that all the fleeing High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts seemed to be under Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's command!

He thought to himself, "Is this some kind of machine uprising?"

Just as Zhang Yu was pondering this, Feng Tingting sent him a message: "Have you seen? Even Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Bionics have rebelled and fled!"

"What Bionic?" Zhang Yu asked.

"The most important Bionic for the Great Dao of Dual Cultivation!" Feng Tingting exclaimed.

"Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Yin Artifact Bionics all use high-intelligence artifact spirits!"

"This time, these high-intelligence artifact spirits rebelled and ran off with Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Yin Artifacts!"

"Huh?" Zhang Yu was stunned.

"Yin Artifacts are one of the most crucial production tools at Joyful Union University," Feng Tingting explained. "With Divine Monarch Jade Nectar suddenly losing so many, the Jade Nectar Coin is going to plummet!"

What the hell...? Zhang Yu thought. A Soul Transformation Divine Monarch's Bionic just gained sentience and ran away?

Lady Fortune remarked, "These high-intelligence artifact spirits could only escape to the Spirit Realm on their own. How could they possibly take the Yin Artifacts with them?"

"Someone must be helping them from behind the scenes. That's the only way these Yin Artifacts could have gotten out..."

Over the next few hours, Zhang Yu occasionally checked the news and soon found more bizarre rumors:

Some claimed the high-intelligence Yin Artifacts had joined the Dual Cultivation Sect, fleeing to pursue Dual Cultivation!

Others said they had joined the Spirit Artifact Protection Organization!

Still others alleged the Yin Artifacts had been bewitched by the Unemployed Demonic Sect and become disciples of the Unemployed Elder!

Zhang Yu was engrossed in reading the news when he noticed the articles were becoming increasingly scarce, soon vanishing altogether.

Lady Fortune sighed, "Joyful Union University has activated a Spirit Realm Talisman to suppress the news!"

Zhang Yu glanced at the news window, which had been updating moments before but now refused to refresh. "They're acting fast!" he remarked.

"I thought the Thousand Fellow Cultivators Assembly was just a few days away," Lady Fortune said. "Now that all the Yin Artifacts are gone, what will they do?"

Moments later, Zhang Yu searched for related news and found an announcement from Divine Monarch Jade Nectar: the Thousand Fellow Cultivators Assembly would proceed as planned. She had stockpiled a vast supply of Dual Cultivation tools, enough to fully support the event.

Zhang Yu recalled that Ping Han was supposed to attend the assembly. He checked Ping Han's social media and found a flood of posts featuring Yang Artifact bionics.

The captions read: "Don't panic! Even without Yin Artifacts, we have Yang Artifacts. I've tested them myself, and their effects are just as potent. The assembly is fully prepared, the lottery will continue as scheduled, and the Jade Nectar Coin will rebound."

Within the Spirit Realm.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole's eyes gleamed. "Excellent! As expected of a bionic crafted by a Soul Transformation expert. Truly exquisite!"

Feng Jiu asked, "True Monarch Magnetic Pole, the School Head wants to know how long it will take to complete this."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole scoffed. "Breaking down a Soul Transformation Bionic isn't easy, especially with the high-intelligence spirit artifact inside. If it catches even a glimpse of an opening, it'll bolt!"

"These few samples aren't enough. What about the rest of the shipment?"

Feng Jiu sighed. "We can't possibly swallow all of it!"

"Then I'll just have to try my best," True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied. "I'll need assistance from the Talisman Department."

Director Gao watched the news of students being swept up in the Financial Storm and ultimately dismantled, a flicker of helplessness crossing his face.

"Ah!"

"This Financial Storm... the Civil Engineering Department didn't get much of the pie, but we sure got our share of the cuts."

Just then, his bionic eye flashed with a new message:

Ping Han: Teacher, save me!

Director Gao shook his head and silently blocked Ping Han.

---

Ping Han: "Junior Brother, please lend me some Spirit Coins!

Ping Han: "Joyful Union University has been deeply involved in Dual Cultivation for years. They'll be producing a new batch of Yin Artifacts soon!

Ping Han: "The Jade Nectar Coin will rebound soon!

Ping Han: "Once the Jade Nectar Coin recovers, I'll earn it all back and repay you immediately!

Zhang Yu watched Ping Han's relentless stream of messages and thought, "How is he typing so fast? Is he mass-messaging everyone?"

Ping Han: "Junior Brother, please!"

Ping Han: "Just help me get through this, and I'll repay you double the amount you lend me."

Zhang Yu: "Senior Brother, I really don't have any money!"

Ping Han: "This is my most desperate hour. I wouldn't beg like this unless absolutely necessary!"

Ping Han: "Are you just going to let me drown?"

Ping Han: "Help me now, and I'll repay you tenfold, a hundredfold in the future!"

Zhang Yu shook his head and blocked Ping Han without hesitation.

Then, he received a message from Ji Yuanshu.

Ji Yuanshu: Senior Brother, could you lend me some Spirit Coins?

Zhang Yu typed several responses, but ultimately sent none. He silently closed the chat window.
