# Chapter 213: A Good-for-nothing Who Never Even Went to College

Hearing Zhang Yu's answer, a sharp glint flashed in Black Crow's eyes, and he laughed.

"Haha, if it's Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, that's a top-tier body tempering technique that many elderly people want to learn and get tutoring for."

"Then I wish you success in your trial class, Teacher Ma, and hope you become the gang's new Gold Medal Teacher."

"Once you become a Gold Medal Teacher, you'll be able to teach the gang's most important, wealthiest clients with the strongest purchasing power. A monthly after-tax income of over a million will be no problem at all."

"By the way, there are three other senior teachers from the gang also here for the trial class today..."

As he spoke, Black Crow led Zhang Yu to the outside of the trial classroom.

Three of the gang's teachers were already waiting there. When they saw Black Crow and Zhang Yu approaching, they couldn't help but look a few more times, a trace of doubt in their eyes.

One of them, a middle-aged woman, asked curiously, "Black Crow, who is this?"

Black Crow introduced him, "This is Teacher Ma Yunteng. He is also here to participate in today's trial class."

Hearing this, all three teachers frowned, their gazes towards Zhang Yu growing colder and more hostile.

The middle-aged woman even directly probed into Zhang Yu's background, asking, "I know all the teachers in the gang who can tutor those at the peak of Qi Refinement. This Teacher Ma looks a bit unfamiliar. Could it be that he just joined the gang?"

Black Crow smiled slightly and said, "Teacher Ma hasn't been with us for long. He was previously in charge of teaching construction site techniques and has been away on business for the past few months. It's normal that you don't know him, Teacher Ci."

Hearing that Zhang Yu used to teach construction site techniques, a trace of contempt flashed through the minds of Teacher Ci and the other two.

After all, the average education level of construction workers was low, their Immortal Dao foundation was poor, and because of long-term use of inferior alchemical enhancers, there were far more intellectually challenged individuals than in other classes.

It could be said that the quality of students in the construction site classes was far inferior to that of the elderly classes, not to mention their purchasing power.

And the standard of teachers who taught the construction site classes was naturally much lower. Whether it was their strength, teaching ability, or the techniques they had mastered, they were often far inferior to the three of them.

Teacher Ci nodded and paid Zhang Yu no more mind. It seemed her opponents today were still the two other senior underground teachers beside her.

Black Crow checked his phone and said, "The elders of the gang have all arrived and are watching the classroom through the cameras."

"I'll go say hello to the students in the class, and then we'll begin the trial lessons."

"The order will be as previously arranged. Teacher Ci, you three will go first, and then Teacher Ma, you will go last. Is that alright?"

Zhang Yu nodded, indicating he had no problem with it.

Black Crow walked into the classroom and saw more than a dozen elderly men with varied temperaments already waiting, some standing and some sitting.

As these dozen or so men with varied temperaments all looked over, feeling the pressure from so many peak Qi Refinement cultivators, Black Crow's steps faltered, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

Black Crow smiled slightly and said, "Sorry to have kept you all waiting. Our trial class will begin shortly. Thank you very much for taking the time..."

Just then, a stern-faced, silver-haired old man in the audience said coldly, "Black Crow, that Teacher Song last time only had a high school education, he never even made it to university, and he dared to come and teach us."

"The teachers you've arranged this time won't be as unreliable, will they?"

Black Crow quickly appeased him, "Elder Wang, although Teacher Song only has a high school education, he has rich teaching experience. A slightly lower education level doesn't affect his ability to teach..."

Elder Wang snorted coldly. "Everyone sitting in this classroom is a university graduate. A high school student can teach us? Can he even teach properly?"

Black Crow wiped the sweat from his brow. He understood that this group of university-educated old men, who had been able to cultivate, study, and work to this age and maintain their consumption levels through their jobs, were all elite workhorses in their companies and absolute academic elitists. In their eyes, it was questionable whether high school graduates even deserved human rights.

Just then, another old man chimed in, "Is your Dark Learning Gang any good? If this were our company, a resume from someone with a high school education wouldn't even reach my desk. Are they worthy of teaching people?"

Yet another old man agreed, "People who can't even get into university are just social dregs, aren't they? They're not even fully evolved; their bloodline is bound to be eliminated sooner or later..."

"Right!" an old woman with a wild mane of hair exclaimed. "Someone who can't pass the university entrance exam, can they even be considered a person?"

"That's going too far, everyone, really." Black Crow quickly tried to console them. "Besides, I guarantee that the teachers for this trial class are all university graduates."

"Hmph." Elder Wang said, "Then we want to see their university diplomas. Only those with a university diploma are qualified to teach here."

Hearing this, Black Crow's face became troubled again. After all, almost every teacher in the gang hid their identity and was unwilling to have their personal information known. How could they possibly provide a university diploma?

Moreover, he had just been speaking casually; he wasn't actually sure if all four teachers today were university graduates.

Black Crow, who himself had a high school education, couldn't help but curse inwardly, _These old fogies, none of them treat high school graduates like human beings._

_They should know that a good high school is no worse than a vocational college, and a good vocational college is no worse than a university. So, an outstanding high school graduate, after years of hard work, is perfectly capable of being a teacher..._

Although he grumbled internally, he didn't dare to offend these important clients.

Just as Black Crow was thinking about how troublesome this was, his phone vibrated. It was a message from the gang elders who were observing the classroom through the cameras.

After reading the contents, Black Crow said to the old men before him, "Everyone, in the dark world of tutoring, one does not have to reveal their identity. This is a long-standing rule of the martial world, and it's not proper for our Dark Learning Gang to break it."

"However, your concerns are also valid. How about we try another way? Each of you can send a representative to personally verify the teacher's cultivation level. How about that?"

Elder Wang frowned and asked, "How do we verify it?"

Black Crow said, "This time, all the teachers are responsible for teaching body tempering. Why don't we have Elder Wang, you, make a move? Each teacher will neither block nor parry, neither dodge nor evade, and will take three of your moves with their physical body. What do you think?"

"With your level, Elder Wang, a teacher who can take three of your blows like that surely won't have only a high school education, right?"

The crowd nodded slightly. After all, high school students who couldn't get into university had to start working right after graduation, leaving them with no time, energy, or wealth to meticulously cultivate various body tempering techniques.

Only university students who went to the Second Layer could continue to focus on their studies during their ten years of university and cultivate more techniques.

Even if they both had level 10 physical strength, a person with a university education, with the enhancement of multiple body tempering techniques, would often far surpass someone with a high school education in all aspects.

Elder Wang said proudly, "Hmph, good-for-nothings who never even went to university certainly couldn't take three of my blows."

"I approve of this method."

Black Crow knew that this Elder Wang had considerable prestige among these old men. Sure enough, once he agreed, the other elderly people had no further objections.

So, Black Crow went out and explained the situation to Zhang Yu and the other three. The other three teachers were full of confidence and agreed without hesitation.

Although Zhang Yu wasn't sure about Elder Wang's actual strength, seeing how things were, he could only agree for now.

But his slight hesitation, in the eyes of Teacher Ci and the other two, was a sign of a lack of confidence. They became even more dismissive of Zhang Yu, even suspecting that he might only have a high school education, hence his hesitation.

Teacher Ci, with the appearance of a middle-aged woman, was the first trial teacher to enter the classroom.

During the cultivation verification, she stood still, allowing Elder Wang to land three consecutive palm strikes on her shoulders and stomach.

With three loud thuds, Teacher Ci retreated five steps. Her face flushed red for a moment before returning to normal.

Elder Wang nodded in approval. "Not bad. Your physical strength has reached the peak, and you possess multiple protective techniques. Only a university graduate could have such a standard."

Having earned the approval of the elderly, Teacher Ci breathed a sigh of relief internally and walked up to the podium to begin her class.

"Today, I am going to teach you all how to defecate."

"This may seem like a trivial daily matter, but there is great knowledge within it, a matter of life and death."

"Many years ago, a senior expert, after working non-stop for ten years, became constipated for half a year due to excessive stress. He finally comprehended a set of techniques on the toilet, which he named the Toxin-Purging Wellness Art."

"What I am going to teach today is this Toxin-Purging Wellness Art. Once mastered, you will be able to expel toxins and impurities from your body every day..."

"The way of body tempering is three parts training, seven parts eating, and the remaining ninety parts all depend on how you inject alchemical enhancers."

"As the saying goes, the more needle marks on your arm, the better your grades will be."

"But the more alchemical enhancers you inject, the more you need to detoxify. So there is another saying, 'A good student must be able to squat'..."

"According to the latest research from the Immortal Capital, a student's body tempering performance is positively correlated with their hemorrhoid rate..."

Watching the elderly people listening intently to her lecture, Teacher Ci felt her motivation growing.

She thought to herself, _For my nine children, to raise them to adulthood, to get them into university, to help them find jobs, I must become a Gold Medal Teacher!_

Every time she thought of her nine children, after growing up, working hard to repay her child-rearing loans, transferring money to her every month, Teacher Ci felt that she was getting closer and closer to the wonderful life of not having to work overtime and only needing to work 12 hours a day.

Meanwhile, the cameras in the classroom captured Teacher Ci's performance, allowing the numerous elders of the Dark Learning Gang, sitting in the conference room on the other side, to see everything clearly.

One of the elders commented, "Little Ci's set lacks innovation, not much flair."

Another elder said, "The curriculum is solid enough, but it's the same old stuff. The renewal rate probably won't be high."

"Let's see the next one."

Outside the classroom, Zhang Yu listened to Teacher Ci's lecture and thought to himself, _She explains profound concepts in simple terms, highlights key points, has memorable hooks, is relaxed and humorous, and incorporates the latest theories... This woman's teaching level is already comparable to that of an excellent teacher at a key high school._

_The competition for the Gold Medal Teacher position in this Dark Learning Gang seems to be more intense than I imagined._

_No, my original preparations are still a bit lacking. I need to add more bargaining chips._

_This woman's weakness is that her Toxin-Purging Wellness Art... is not advanced enough._

_I must highlight the advantages of Spring and Autumn Endless Zen in terms of taking alchemical enhancers!_
