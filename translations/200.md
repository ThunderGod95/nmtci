# Chapter 200: The Second Round of the Foundation Establishment Examination Ends

As the simulated depth decreased, Ye Lingxiao activated one protective cultivation technique after another, causing Zhang Yu, who was watching from the side, to raise his eyebrows repeatedly. He recognized the Titanium Body Tempering Formula among them; it was a technique he had seen during the last Foundation Establishment examination.

By now, Ye Lingxiao's depth had reached -2581 meters. His entire body shimmered with a golden light, exuding a metallic luster like a divine statue standing in the depths of the sea.

It was clear that a depth of -2581 meters had still not reached Ye Lingxiao’s limit.

Just as everyone was stunned by Ye Lingxiao's terrifying strength, thinking he would continue, Huang Zichou spoke up, "Alright, Number 23, your total score is already high enough for first place. You don’t need to continue."

Only then did Ye Lingxiao nod and choose to end the test.

With that, the top two finishers in the physical track of the second round of the Foundation Establishment examination had been decided: Zhang Yu and Ye Lingxiao.

The two of them would also participate in the final round of this year’s Foundation Establishment examination next January to compete for the Foundation Establishment qualification certificate.

_What a monster,_ Yu Xinghan thought as he watched Ye Lingxiao walk out of the Dinghai Pillar. _This year's Foundation Establishment qualification certificate is definitely his for the taking._

_But if that's the case, it means I'll have to take the same examination as Zhang Yu again next year._

Although Zhang Yu's current strength seemed far inferior to Ye Lingxiao's, his rate of improvement still made Yu Xinghan incredibly envious, one might even say jealous.

_During the last Foundation Establishment examination, he was only a little bit ahead of me._

_But in this second round, he's completely surpassed me._

At this thought, Yu Xinghan's expression turned ugly. _How is this Zhang Yu kid improving so fast? It's simply unbelievable._

_Especially since this kid is obviously so poor. I can't just let this go…_

Yu Xinghan was somewhat aware of Zhang Yu's poverty. Especially when working overtime with him at the Red Pagoda every week, he could sense the aura of poverty on him, just like his own past self.

_If this kid were rich, there might not be much I could do._

_But since he’s so poor anyway…_

Yu Xinghan had already made up his mind; he would talk to his Senior Sister Li Xuelian when he got back.

_I'll ask Senior Sister for money when I get back,_ he thought.

_And then add more classes!_

_I absolutely have to add more classes with Zhang Yu, preferably train with him every day. I must figure out what kind of Immortal Dao secret he has._

_Also… next year, I must reach an understanding with him to enter different tracks in the Foundation Establishment examination. That’s the only way I'll have a chance to grab a qualification certificate._

_Speaking of which…_ Yu Xinghan mused, _if both Zhang Yu and I get a qualification certificate next year, we could actually attend one of the Ten Greats together._

Remembering what True Person Starfire had said about the Ten Greats, Yu Xinghan thought, _Once we get to the second layer, our competitors will be those young masters from above._

_If I have a familiar friend like Zhang Yu at that time, maybe we can look out for each other._

Yu Xinghan still remembered True Person Starfire telling him that when he had first been admitted to Myriad Laws University, one of the Ten Greats, he had been taught a lesson by an upper-layer young master.

Later, True Person Starfire, refusing to accept it, challenged the young master again, only to be taught another lesson.

He repeatedly fought and lost, challenging those upper-layer masters for his entire ten years of university until finally… True Person Starfire accepted his place.

Through this story, True Person Starfire wanted to tell Yu Xinghan that some people are born ahead of you, and you will never catch up to them in this lifetime.

Also, it was very important to have friends who could lend you money and share the pressure.

Yu Xinghan deeply agreed with this.

On the other side, Zhang Yu felt Yu Xinghan's gaze. _Why is this guy staring at me?_

Recalling how the other party had sought him out for sparring after the last athletics meet, Zhang Yu thought, _Don't tell me this guy is planning to ask me for extra lessons and train with me when we get back?_

_If that’s the case, I could make some money._

But thinking about Yu Xinghan’s current job, selling seeds to pay for sparring sessions with him, Zhang Yu couldn't help but feel that something was off.

_What's so weird about it?_ Zhang Yu suppressed the strange feeling in his heart. _Isn't money from selling seeds still money?_

Next, as the examination rankings were announced, the candidates began to leave under the arrangement of the righteous gods.

Before leaving, however, a thought occurred to Zhang Yu, reminding him of Zhou Chechen and the Zhou family.

So he took the initiative to speak up, "Examiner, I have something to report."

Under the curious gazes of the other candidates, Zhang Yu stayed behind alone.

Huang Zichou looked at Zhang Yu with a smile, asking kindly, "What is it?"

Although there was a significant gap in strength between Zhang Yu and Ye Lingxiao, and he likely wouldn't get the qualification certificate this year, in Huang Zichou's eyes, Zhang Yu might be even more valuable than Ye Lingxiao. He could trace the Ye clan behind Ye Lingxiao, but he couldn't find out which major figure was behind Zhang Yu.

And the more he couldn't find out, the more extraordinary Huang Zichou felt it was.

Now that Zhang Yu had taken the initiative to speak, Huang Zichou planned to take the opportunity to befriend him, considering it a good deed.

However, despite Huang Zichou’s intentions, reality did not give him the chance.

Before Zhang Yu could speak, Deng Bingding appeared beside them and said flatly, "Zichou, go write today's report first. I'll handle things here."

Glancing at the expressionless Deng Bingding, Huang Zichou was stunned. _You're not serious… you're even trying to snatch this? Could the person behind this Zhang Yu be even more influential than I initially thought?_

Huang Zichou left helplessly, cursing inwardly, _All that money I spent was for nothing._

Deng Bingding looked at Zhang Yu and said nonchalantly, "What is it?"

Zhang Yu then recounted the incident of being followed by the Zhou family in Songyang City, finally summarizing, "…I’m worried they are trying to investigate my participation in the Foundation Establishment examination, so I wanted to report it to you, Examiner."

Listening to Zhang Yu's words, Deng Bingding wore a wry smile.

A family in Songyang City daring to investigate the Foundation Establishment examination? Deng Bingding found that hard to believe.

It was more likely that Zhang Yu was trying to use her to burn this Zhou family.

However, Deng Bingding naturally did not expose him. Instead, she pondered whether Zhang Yu was doing this on his own accord, or if the person behind him wanted him to do it.

Unsure, Deng Bingding went along with it, saying, "I understand. I will have someone investigate the Zhou family to see if they have been prying into the Foundation Establishment examination."

"Add me as a friend. If anything else comes up, you can tell me anytime."

"Add you as a friend?" Zhang Yu said, feeling both surprised and flattered.

"Protecting the information security of every student in the Foundation Establishment examination is the duty of us examiners. It’s what we should do," Deng Bingding said flatly.

Zhang Yu added Deng Bingding as a friend with some surprise._So you can add righteous gods as friends? Why haven't I seen this function on my talisman? Is it because my faith level is too low?_

Watching Zhang Yu's departing figure, Deng Bingding's thoughts shifted slightly. _Have the results from the other side come in as well?_

…

On the other side, at the Martial Arts examination hall.

Bai Zhenzhen ultimately stepped onto the arena, choosing to fight Yun Jing.

_At the very least, I need to see where the gap between us lies._

Of course, another reason was to take advantage of the medical insurance.

With this in mind, Bai Zhenzhen walked onto the stage, and the medical insurance limit of 1,000,000 once again appeared above her head.

However, the moment the insurance limit appeared, the number began to decrease rapidly, only stopping after it had fallen by more than two hundred thousand.

As the treatment finished, Bai Zhenzhen felt a sense of comfort throughout her body; the lingering injuries from the previous arena match had all been healed.

On the other side of the arena, Yun Jing asked calmly, "Are you healed?"

"Wait, let me warm up first," Bai Zhenzhen said, twisting her body. The next moment, she suddenly flickered, rushing toward Yun Jing with a trail of electric sparks.

Invisible sword qi surged from her fingertips as she unleashed a sky-full of sword strikes, aiming to tear Yun Jing apart.

At this moment, Bai Zhenzhen was using the Myriad Sword Everlasting Art, which she had already cultivated to level 8.

The sword moves of this technique were nearly endless. Executed at high speed by Bai Zhenzhen and augmented by her thunder magic power, it was like a vast and mighty thunderstorm rolling toward Yun Jing.

Of course, Bai Zhenzhen didn't think she could defeat Yun Jing with this attack. She just wanted to use her high speed and the numerous moves of the Myriad Sword Everlasting Art to attack Yun Jing from as many different angles as possible, to probe for more of his reactions and gather more intelligence for her competition with him in the next Foundation Establishment examination.

In Yun Jing's eyes, which had been refined into a bionic, he could not only see every one of Bai Zhenzhen's moves clearly, but he could even see the numbers that appeared with each move.

-3200
-500
-4899

Those numbers represented the amount of medical insurance that would be consumed if each move hit him.

Through these numbers, Yun Jing seemed to be able to find the flaws in Bai Zhenzhen's moves and distinguish between feints and real attacks.

But Yun Jing didn't do that.

He simply raised his palm and thrust it out in Bai Zhenzhen's direction.

With the explosive power of the dual dantians in his body, waves of fiery astral qi erupted like a volcano, continuously pumping out from his body. It stood like a crimson city wall on the arena, splitting it in two, and then pressed down on Bai Zhenzhen.

Boom!

Seeing the astral qi that blotted out the sky and feeling the astonishing heat wave that rushed toward her, Bai Zhenzhen changed her sword moves. Streaks of sword qi laced with lightning struck Yun Jing's astral qi.

Amidst a series of explosive bangs, the sword qi shattered. The churning astral qi was quickly replenished, and Bai Zhenzhen was forced back again and again, eventually being squeezed off the arena by the wall of astral qi.

_To force me off the stage with sheer astral qi, that's just an unreasonable way to fight…_

_No skill at all, just a foundation built entirely on money._

Looking at Yun Jing on the stage and recalling his fighting style, Bai Zhenzhen felt a headache coming on.
