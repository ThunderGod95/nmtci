# Chapter 408: Evil Cult

Inside the Pharmaceutical Factory, with Zhang Yu having successfully completed the factory construction, today marked the official deployment of the assembly line.

Zhang Yu arrived early to assist with the setup.

If the assembly line was completed today, he would finish his work five days ahead of schedule, earning him a bonus.

As he walked through the factory floor, Zhang Yu observed the assembly line being installed while activating the Yin-Yang Bracelet to refine his physical body.

Feeling the yang qi and yin essence circulating within him under the bracelet's stimulation, Zhang Yu felt as if his body was being tempered by alternating waves of scorching heat and freezing cold, gradually becoming stronger and more resilient.

This sensation... sometimes made him feel like a magical artifact being repeatedly forged by the Yin-Yang Bracelet.

Regarding Zhang Yu's feelings and thoughts, Lady Fortune remarked, "Speaking of which... in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's eyes, you might just be raw material for a magical artifact."

"If she discovers you lack talent in artifact refinement techniques, she'll probably develop your innate aptitude for being refined into an artifact instead."

"True Monarch Magnetic Pole likely began valuing you after the competition because she recognized your talent for being refined into an artifact."

Lady Fortune's reminder jolted Zhang Yu awake.

"If I'm truly being groomed as artifact refinement material, I won't even get a chance to join the Ten Great Sects, let alone the Ten Greats League."

"As expected... I need to complete the artifact refinement course as soon as possible and gradually showcase my talent in this field."

Just then, a Junior College Student suddenly died on the newly established assembly line.

Moments later, a Pharmaceutical Factory worker approached.

A graduate of the 72 Lower Colleges, he was responsible for maintaining the factory's assembly lines.

With a series of practiced motions, he conjured a spectral projection from the deceased student's body.

The student chuckled. "Everyone, I'm dying first! Work hard to earn money, and keep my corpse working well!"

The surrounding Junior College Students watched with envy.

"Dying on the first day of work?"

"Now he can enjoy eternal bliss in the Spirit Realm. As a Soul Cultivator, he'll never be hungry or tired, and his next life's job is already secured."

"I heard Soul Cultivators can work overtime as much as they want. They get paid 0.0006 Spirit Coins per hour starting the day they die!"

"That much?!"

Hearing the commotion from the surrounding Junior College Students, the maintenance worker impatiently pressed the assembly line's mute button. Instantly, all the students fell silent, unable to make a sound.

"Get back to work and stop chatting during work hours."

With that, the maintenance worker carried the corpse to the Production Manager and said respectfully, "Manager Qu, a Junior College Student died. I've already taken care of it."

The Production Manager, Qu Lecheng, was a graduate of Myriad Laws University. In the eyes of the maintenance workers, he was the ultimate academic overachiever, the pinnacle of Cultivators — a figure from another world compared to them, the Lower College Students.

Qu Lecheng frowned. "What's going on with the lines you're overseeing? The sudden death rate has been unusually high these past few months, hasn't it?"

The maintenance worker replied helplessly, "It's all because of the poor quality of this new batch of Junior College Students."

Qu Lecheng said coldly, "That's your problem to solve. If another Junior College Student dies this month, I'll deduct 0.02 Spirit Coins from your pay."

The maintenance worker opened his mouth to speak, but ultimately lowered his head and said, "Manager Qu, I have some personal matters to attend to and need to request leave to go home."

Qu Lecheng patted the worker's shoulder and said, "No problem. Just treat the Pharmaceutical Factory like your own home."

Seeing Zhang Yu approaching, Qu Lecheng waved the maintenance worker away, urging, "Get back to work quickly. Remember, another Junior College Student death this month, and you'll lose 0.02 Spirit Coins."

With that, Qu Lecheng turned to greet Zhang Yu.

Qu Lecheng graduated from the Pharmacy Institute at Myriad Laws University and currently served as one of the Production Managers at the Pharmaceutical Factory. He was also the liaison for Zhang Yu's project.

Despite being a Myriad Laws graduate, Qu Lecheng never managed to obtain the Foundation Establishment Qualification Certificate before graduation.

Now standing before Zhang Yu, he felt acutely inferior, unconsciously bowing slightly as he spoke.

"Engineer Zhang," Qu Lecheng said with a strained smile, "we'll be relying on your expertise for the rest of the project. This is just a small token of our appreciation..."

[0.5 Spirit Coins]

Seeing the transfer amount, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "This is indeed a very small token."

Zhang Yu accepted the 0.5 Spirit Coin and said calmly, "Don't worry, finishing quickly benefits me too. I'll work as fast as I can."

Several hours later, the assembly line was finally set up and running smoothly.

Zhang Yu's task of constructing this factory area was now complete. Next, he would participate in expanding other factory areas.

Qu Lecheng smiled. "Engineer Zhang, thank you for your hard work today. I know Senior Engineers in the Civil Engineering Department often need massages, so I've arranged for a skilled technician to come."

Zhang Yu's gaze flickered as he sized up Qu Lecheng. "That's thoughtful of you."

Qu Lecheng: "I'll take you there now. Don't worry, I'll oversee things here and let you know if anything comes up."

Moments later, Zhang Yu was in an adjacent office, enjoying the massage technician's efforts to relieve the fatigue and strain in his muscles.

Feeling the technician's skillful techniques, Zhang Yu glanced in surprise at the technician's robust physique. He hadn't expected Qu Lecheng to hire such a skilled masseuse.

The massage technician's name was Wan Sirou, a graduate of Qinghe Arts University.

Her purpose in posing as a massage therapist today was to deceive Zhang Yu into providing his seed.

As she massaged Zhang Yu, Wan Sirou deliberately showcased her towering physique, rippling muscles, and especially her bronze-cast arms, which she swung back and forth in front of him.

Seeing Zhang Yu close his eyes, Wan Sirou thought, "A typical Civil Engineering student from an ordinary university would have already made a move by now."

"This man is clearly capable of arousal, yet he shows no reaction whatsoever? Just as my employer said, his dao heart is remarkably steadfast, impervious to ordinary temptations."

However, Wan Sirou knew Zhang Yu was an academic overachiever at Myriad Laws University. She never intended to rely solely on her physical allure to subdue him.

Activating her Magic Power, she unleashed the Divine Spirit Technique she had cultivated for years, her every movement now radiating a dragon-like, tiger-like, captivating charisma.

"Student," Wan Sirou said, "would you like kidney maintenance?"

Zhang Yu opened his eyes and glanced at Wan Sirou, noticing her flushed complexion and the way her body seemed to swell with blood, making her appear even taller and her arm muscles more pronounced.

He closed his eyes again and said calmly, "No need. Just massage me."

"Come on, classmate," Wan Sirou persisted. "I'll give you a 70% discount."

"No need," Zhang Yu replied.

Wan Sirou thought in surprise, "Even a 70% discount doesn't tempt him?"

No matter how Wan Sirou tried to entice him, Zhang Yu remained as still as a pond, showing not the slightest reaction. This left Wan Sirou utterly stumped and severely doubting her own allure.

"This kid..." she mused. "Does he not like biological women? Or does he have some kind of twisted aesthetic?"

Just as Wan Sirou was feeling defeated, a massive explosion suddenly rocked the Pharmaceutical Factory.

Zhang Yu's eyes snapped open. In a flash, he darted toward the source of the blast like a bolt of lightning.

---

The explosion originated from a pharmaceutical production line.

When Zhang Yu arrived, he saw a massive crater blasted into the assembly line. Raw materials continued to spill everywhere as the line continued to operate.

"Someone attacked the assembly line?" Zhang Yu thought in surprise. "Who could it be?"

He scanned the area but found no trace of the attacker.

Soon, more Pharmaceutical Factory staff arrived. Some began repairing the assembly line, while others investigated the cause of the incident.

The truth was simple: according to surveillance footage, a Soul Cultivator had piloted a Bionic in a suicide attack, leaving behind a distinctive mark.

Watching the Bionic explode on the monitor, Qu Lecheng gritted his teeth. "It's the Dual Rest Cult!"

Zhang Yu asked, puzzled, "Dual cultivation... can that really be considered an Evil Cult?"

Qu Lecheng explained, "Not dual cultivation. That is of course, a righteous path on the immortal path — as righteous as it gets."

"What I'm talking about is Dual Rest."
[TL note: Dual Cultivation 双修 and Dual Rest 双休 sound the same in Chinese]

Qu Lecheng roared, "This Dual Rest Cult is spreading its heresy everywhere, demanding two days of rest per month and recruiting workers from factories and companies! It's utter lawlessness!"

Meanwhile, news of the Dual Rest Cult gradually spread along the assembly line, sending the Junior College Students into a panic.

The students on the temporarily halted assembly lines, with no work to do, were particularly terrified.

"They want us to rest two days a month? Are they even human?!"

"Losing two days' wages? Are they trying to starve us to death?"

"The pharmaceutical industry is so competitive! If the factory shuts down, where will we find work?"

Soon, the entire assembly line was filled with complaints about the Dual Rest Cult.

Zhang Yu turned to Qu Lecheng and couldn't help but ask, "Where did this Dual Rest Cult come from?"

Qu Lecheng: "I don't know where they came from. They just suddenly appeared out of nowhere — a bunch of heartless lunatics who refuse to work hard. They've somehow bewitched countless Soul Cultivators and Junior College Students, turning them into terrorists."

"Even though the Righteous Gods and universities are hunting them down everywhere, we can never completely eradicate them."

"Damn it... There must be an inside mole using them for commercial sabotage. Dual Rest? What kind of insane idea is that?"

Just then, a maintenance worker approached and said, "Manager Qu, the assembly line is severely damaged. It'll probably take two days to repair and restart production."

The thought of the production halt's losses and the impact on his own performance evaluation fueled the fury blazing in Qu Lecheng's eyes.

"Two days?" Qu Lecheng snapped. "Just as I suspected — the work of the Dual Rest Cult. They love using terrorist attacks to shut down production for two days."

Turning to the maintenance worker, Qu Lecheng declared, "We won't surrender to this Evil Cult! Repair the assembly line at full speed! We can only afford one day of downtime. Get it back up and running by tomorrow!"
