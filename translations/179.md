# Chapter 179: A New Chapter of the Feather Book

Fu Ji listened to Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's expectant questions and replied, "How could it be that fast."

Sensing their questioning gazes, she quickly explained, "I have been weak for too long. To completely devour this fellow will require time."

"Before, I had only temporarily suppressed him."

"But it's like an ant nibbling on a chicken leg. To completely devour it… how can that be finished in the span of a single meal?"

Fu Ji continued, "First, help me completely devour this fellow. Only after I've digested his evil god status can I then raise the potential of you two."

Thus, under Fu Ji's guidance, Zhang Yu once again pressed the black pearl that was Fu Ji's transformed state onto the teddy bear's head.

About an hour later, the teddy bear before them abruptly disintegrated, turning into a pile of ash that dissipated into the air.

"I need to sleep for a day or two. Wait until I've finished digesting…"

Fu Ji only had time to leave these words before she fell into a deep slumber, becoming completely unresponsive no matter how Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen called out to her.

For the next two days, the black pearl that Fu Ji had become seemed to have turned into a completely inanimate object. Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen could only cultivate and earn money while they waited for Fu Ji to awaken.

During this period, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen also kept up with the situation regarding Song Xu through the news and the internet.

However, from what the news reported, they could only see information about the pirated cultivation technique incident; there was no mention of evil gods or their believers.

Bai Zhenzhen said with some nervousness, "That final move you made, which caused the six cultists to suffer a backlash, created quite a commotion. Many people in the vicinity saw them jump down, as well as the sight of them engulfed in flames."

"Could someone suspect it's an evil god incident, and the righteous gods have already begun to investigate?"

Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but say, "Why don't we go back and check the apartment where the evil god used to live? To see if anyone is investigating…"

"Hm?" Zhang Yu glanced at Bai Zhenzhen, thinking to himself, _Zhen has so little composure. It's obvious she's not used to committing crimes, immediately making the classic mistake of a suspect returning to the scene of the crime._

"What happens if we look? And what happens if we don't?" Zhang Yu said. "In any case, we've already done everything we could. If someone really has started to investigate, that's something we are powerless to stop."

"Instead of dwelling on it, we might as well focus on increasing our strength."

Zhang Yu clenched his fist, feeling the magic power within his body that had already broken past ninety points and had been surging with increasing ferocity lately.

"In Kunxu, after all, the stronger you are, the more money you make, and the more money you have, the safer you are."

Fu Ji's deathly silence continued until the evening of the third day.

Following a groan that emanated from the pearl, Fu Ji's voice was heard, filled with deep satisfaction, "That was exhilarating!"

She laughed heartily and declared, "Today, I have reassembled my status and once again set foot on the true path of an evil god! In the days to come, I will surely create a new peak for myself and stand at the pinnacle of Kunxu!"

Hearing the sound from Fu Ji, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, who had been cultivating in their room, immediately focused their attention on her.

Zhang Yu pinched the pearl and said, "How about it? You can raise my potential now, right?"

Feeling the astral qi pulsing in Zhang Yu's palm, Fu Ji quickly said, "Don't be anxious, don't be anxious, I'll get it done for you right now."

As she spoke, Zhang Yu felt a sinister, cold, and heretical power surge out from the black pearl that was Fu Ji, rushing up his arm, over his shoulder, up his neck… and straight into his sea of consciousness.

The next moment, Zhang Yu felt a sharp pain in the palm of his hand.

Opening his palm to look, he saw a transparent symbol forming there. As the heretical power from the black pearl grew more torrential, the symbol was turning black at a speed visible to the naked eye.

_It's just like the symbol from when the Feather Book first appeared, only it has become more complex._

And as the symbol turned completely black, the Feather Book materialized before Zhang Yu and slowly opened.

The first page was still the table of contents, and the word 'Prologue' on the first line were still clearly visible.

But now, the line of script that had been blurry beneath the prologue was gradually becoming clear.

Zhang Yu focused his gaze and murmured to himself, "Chapter One, Technique-Chaining Diagram."

Then, the Feather Book's pages turned as if moved by an unseen wind, flipping of their own accord to the section for Chapter One, the Technique-Chaining Diagram, in accordance with Zhang Yu's will.

Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms, Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, Freehand Combat, Basic High School Swordplay Level 0, Heavenly Martial Heart-Tempering Art…

All the cultivation techniques that Zhang Yu practiced were listed out one by one.

And beneath this list of techniques lay a vast, black scroll.

When Zhang Yu tried to focus his will on one of the techniques, he discovered that he could drag them, just as he had been able to in the Feather Book's prologue.

So, Zhang Yu dragged the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms and tried placing it into the black scroll below, wanting to see what would happen.

As the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms settled into the scroll, the technique immediately transformed into a white star that landed upon the black canvas, twinkling like a star in the night sky.

And beneath the star formed by the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms, Zhang Yu saw three lines of text.

Primary - High School Sacred Body (1/6)

Advanced - High School Sacred Body (1/8)

Ultimate - High School Sacred Body (1/10)

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback, unable to immediately grasp what this meant.

He then tried dragging different techniques into the night sky and discovered that a maximum of ten techniques could be dragged in total.

And after each technique transformed into a star suspended in the night sky, three lines of text would appear.

For example, the Primary, Advanced, and Ultimate High School Sacred Body for the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms.

Or, for another example, the Primary, Advanced, and Ultimate Martial Dao Holy Embryo for the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen.

Gradually, Zhang Yu also came to understand the meaning behind it.

"The function of this Technique-Chaining Diagram is to link different cultivation techniques together to form a kind of set effect, right?"

Zhang Yu decided to call this phenomenon a technique set.

"Each technique set requires six techniques to form the first set effect, eight for the second set effect, and ten for the third set effect."

And techniques like Zhang Yu's Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms, Basic Heart Tempering Art, and Basic Breathing Technique all displayed the High School Sacred Body technique set.

However, for the Basic Heart Tempering Art and the Basic Breathing Technique, the words "High School Sacred Body" beneath them appeared grayed out.

Zhang Yu guessed inwardly, "Is it because I haven't leveled up these two basic techniques much, and neither has reached level 10?"

Besides the High School Sacred Body set, for which Zhang Yu could gather three techniques, he discovered that the technique set for which he could assemble the most techniques was called Full-Attendance Beggar.

The techniques it included were Excavator Palm, Crane Claw, Sports Car Legs, and Elevator Leap.

"This Full-Attendance Beggar doesn't sound like anything good at all. Better to forget about it."

"High School Sacred Body sounds like it should be quite strong, but…"

Zhang Yu thought for a moment, but still looked with greater eagerness toward the technique set for Spring and Autumn Endless Zen: Martial Dao Holy Embryo.

And the technique sets for Dragon-Elephant Mountain-Shattering Palm and Dragonback Mountain Toppler Hand: Scion of Dragons.

And the technique set for Heavenly Martial Heart-Tempering Art: Heavenly Martial Battle Heart. And the set for Desolate Ox Soul-Suppressing Mantra and Crippled Ox Body-Sacrifice Heart Art: Great Sage's Successor.

_The 'Great Sage' in 'Great Sage's Successor,' does it refer to that Great Sage Desolate Ox who created the Desolate Ox Soul-Suppressing Mantra and the Crippled Ox Body-Sacrifice Heart Art?_

_Hmm, still, Martial Dao Holy Embryo, Scion of Dragons, Heavenly Martial Battle Heart, and Great Sage's Successor—these technique sets look powerful just from their names._

"But what other techniques do these sets require?"

"Surely it can't be that I only find out which technique set a technique belongs to after I've mastered it, right? At that rate, wouldn't it take me long time to complete a single set?"

At this thought, Zhang Yu couldn't help but frown slightly as he picked up his phone and began to browse a website for purchasing cultivation techniques.

At his side, Fu Ji and Bai Zhenzhen had been observing Zhang Yu ever since his potential was stimulated.

Seeing Zhang Yu's expressions shift from puzzled, to excited, to frowning, both the person and the god were filled with utter confusion.

Fu Ji thought to herself, _It's just stimulating his potential. Why is this fellow acting like he's watching some kind of video, with such a rich variety of expressions? What in the world is his potential?_

Bai Zhenzhen, on the other hand, couldn't resist asking, "Yu-boy, are you all right?"

"I'm fine, I'm great," Zhang Yu laughed. "Never been better."

Zhang Yu scanned the cultivation technique purchasing website on his screen. With every description of a technique he finished reading, the technique set for that technique would appear in his mind.

_Although it's still quite troublesome to search for them, at least I have a goal now._

_No… that's not right. I can't search for them like looking for a needle in a haystack._

Zhang Yu looked at the High School Sacred Body technique set and the three basic techniques within it, then directly searched for high school basic cultivation techniques on the shopping website. In an instant, he immediately found several more techniques that belonged to the High School Sacred Body set.

_It should be the same for the other techniques. I should look for similar techniques based on their names and the types of techniques included._

Bai Zhenzhen and Fu Ji simply watched as Zhang Yu smiled one moment and looked troubled the next, staring at his phone and scrolling for a full half hour before he stopped, seemingly wanting for more.

Zhang Yu summarized in his mind, _Sigh, I don't have enough money._

_The Martial Dao Holy Embryo technique set requires body tempering martial arts that are almost all as expensive as Spring and Autumn Endless Zen._

_And the techniques for Scion of Dragons and Heavenly Martial Battle Heart aren't cheap either._

As for Great Sage's Successor, Zhang Yu had not yet found any other techniques belonging to that set.

_After I've cultivated Spring and Autumn Endless Zen to level 10, I'll complete the High School Sacred Body technique set first and see what the effect is like._

After forming a general idea of the Technique-Chaining Diagram in the first chapter of the Feather Book and making a plan for his future cultivation, Zhang Yu finally lifted his head, looked at Bai Zhenzhen, and said, "This thing wasn't lying."

"It really did raise my Immortal Dao potential."

"But to what extent this potential has been raised will still require time to verify."

Upon hearing this, Bai Zhenzhen smiled, her face full of anticipation as she said, "Then it's my turn next, right?"

Fu Ji said, "A wish ritual is not something that can be performed casually. It requires proper preparation."

"The two of you follow the requirements I'm about to list. Buy the things that need to be bought, find the places that need to be found."

"Everything must be prepared properly before we can proceed."
