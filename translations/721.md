# Chapter 721: True Monarch's Special Approval — Money! Come!

Chang Buxiu was a poor man.

His mother had named him "Buxiu," meaning "unyielding," hoping he would always have work and never struggle to repay his birth debt.

Unfortunately, Chang Buxiu's talent was mediocre. He was said to have been born with congenital deficiencies, possessing only the lowest-grade Immortal Dao Potential. Through three years of grueling effort in high school — pushing his body to its limits and relying on potent, potential-enhancing drugs — he barely managed to graduate from a vocational college as a peak Qi Refining cultivator.

But graduation brought unemployment. As the number of junior college students surged annually, finding work became increasingly difficult. He survived on temporary jobs, barely making ends meet.

The Great Upheaval and the outbreak of war worsened his situation. Prices soared, jobs vanished, and his income plummeted, while expenses for safety and survival skyrocketed, causing his weight to dwindle further.

During this time, he lost contact with many classmates and friends. Some were arrested for unauthorized breakthroughs, others joined the Righteous Qi Alliance and disappeared, while still others were caught in the crossfire of battles, vanished in the aftermath, or succumbed to illness and medicine shortages.

Chang Buxiu had considered joining the Righteous Qi Alliance, but he couldn't bring himself to abandon everything and commit to opposing the Heavenly Court.

"What if things get worse with the Righteous Qi Alliance? What if the Heavenly Court returns?"

He didn't care about the Righteous Qi Alliance's promises of no Vocational College distinctions, treating everyone as University Students, or teaching Immortal Sect Techniques. All he wanted was to survive, nothing more.

As the Soul Transformation War escalated, the situation grew increasingly dire. Finally, with the launch of the Heaven-Piercing Plan, massive factories opened and production lines expanded. Chang Buxiu finally achieved his long-held dream of becoming a full-time factory worker.

From then on, he could voluntarily work overtime every day, earning a stable monthly wage and overtime pay. He could even afford a few extra painkillers each day.

He thought his life was finally improving, but as large numbers of Junior College Students fled to the Righteous Qi Alliance after maxing out their microloans, Chang Buxiu, also a Junior College Student, found his monthly borrowing limits shrinking and loan approvals becoming increasingly strict.

His lifelong accumulation of debt left him with virtually no financial resilience, and he soon faced the brink of bankruptcy.

Today, as Chang Buxiu stared at the notification popping up in his Bionic Eye, he fell into a daze.

"No interest, no repayment deadline, directly deposited into my account?" he murmured to himself. "What is this?"

After scrutinizing the notification again, he thought, "Relief funds? A free donation?"

Chang Buxiu immediately suspected a scam, much like the Evil God scams that had become rampant after the Great Upheaval. He even wondered if he had been infected with a virus from the Demonic Sect.

"Am I poisoned? Is that why I'm seeing this hallucination?"

His brow furrowed, Chang Buxiu dared not reveal his suspicion of poisoning to anyone, fearing he would lose his job.

It wasn't until his colleagues began discussing the relief funds that Chang Buxiu realized he wasn't the only one affected.

But his heart sank further. "Did the Righteous Qi Alliance attack the factory and poison us? Will they fire us all?"

Chang Buxiu recalled the news of a factory that had fired all its employees after one worker contracted the Dual Rest Virus, all in the name of safety.

Yet some workers refused to believe they had been infected.

One argued, "The money's already been deposited. It must be a glitch in the company's financial system."

Someone else warned, "Everyone, be extremely careful not to misuse this money! If we cause losses to the company, we'll all be fired and have to pay back the funds!"

A worker exclaimed in panic, "Wh-what do I do? Today's my loan repayment date, and the money that came in was automatically deducted!"

The others looked at him with pity, as if he were already dead.

One person suggested, "Quickly sell whatever you can to repay the company's mistaken transfer first."

Another chimed in, "Right, right! Otherwise, they'll charge you with theft, and you'll be finished! You'll have to take a pay cut for any job you find..."

Chang Buxiu shook his head at the man, then glanced at the extra money in his account, his mind racing to find a safe place to store it so he could return it immediately when the company asked for it back.

Just then, all factory workers received a video link in their Bionic Eyes.

Someone gasped, "True Monarch Blazing Light!"

"Is that the Quasi-Soul Transformation cultivator?"

"What's he saying?"

Chang Buxiu watched Zhang Yu in the video, listening to him say things like "apologies for causing panic," "you really don't need to repay it," "there's no interest," and "this is to help everyone through this difficult time"...

"He's gone mad," Chang Buxiu thought to himself. "Has True Monarch Blazing Light lost his mind?"

After Zhang Yu's repeated assurances, people finally began using the Spirit Coins deposited into their accounts.

Chang Buxiu couldn't resist any longer and used his Spirit Coins to buy pain medication.

As the lingering aches from his High School days gradually subsided, a faint smile crept onto his lips.

"I can do more piecework today and earn extra overtime pay."

"At this rate, I won't go bankrupt."

"This is wonderful."

Shortly after, another notification appeared before Chang Buxiu.

"...True Monarch has personally approved a salary increase for you?!"

"A... a salary increase! The True Monarch personally approved a salary increase for me?" Chang Buxiu's eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at the notification.

Salary increases were legendary among Junior College Students, considered a once-in-ten-thousand immortal fortune. It was said that only the Students of the Top Ten, blessed by heaven and earth, ever encountered such opportunities.

Having never actually witnessed a Junior College Student receive a salary increase, Chang Buxiu had always suspected that these stories were fabricated — tales of the Top Ten's students twisted and attributed to Junior College Students to create clickbait narratives.

But today, not only had he encountered this legendary fortune, but the one receiving the salary increase was himself.

"I've actually encountered immortal fortune?!"

"True Monarch Blazing Light personally approved this and enlightened me himself?"

In that moment, countless stories flooded Chang Buxiu's mind: ancient Immortals enlightening mortals, senior cultivators guiding juniors, and tales of the wealthy leading the poor to fortune — the kind of wish-fulfillment narratives that dominated online fiction.

Glancing at his coworkers still toiling around him, Chang Buxiu struggled to suppress the joy on his face, determined to reveal nothing. "I absolutely can't let anyone know I got a raise."

Simultaneously, the Magic Power within him surged, banishing all fatigue and pain. His work efficiency soared once more.

In that instant, Chang Buxiu envisioned his future salary climbing steadily under True Monarch Blazing Light's guidance, surpassing Vocational College level, then Lower College, even rivaling Upper College Students. He would finally pay off his debts and live a life free from daily pain medication.

"True Monarch, watch me."

"I'll prove you didn't misjudge me. I truly possess the potential for a higher salary..."

But then, Chang Buxiu noticed something strange: his coworkers were all wearing mysterious smiles.

The entire factory seemed to be working with renewed fervor, the assembly lines humming like they were about to burst into flames.

---

Kunxu's Third Layer.

Near the Grand Void.

Xiong Wenwu had been summoned by Hu Yuntao.

Following the navigation in his Bionic Eye, he arrived at the interview site, only to be astonished to discover that all the applicants were monsterfolk.

"A monsterfolk-exclusive interview?" Xiong Wenwu stared in disbelief at the projection screen in the distance. "Is this even allowed?"

"Wouldn't this be considered discrimination?"

As a senior at Celestial Monsters University, Xiong Wenwu was already deeply familiar with various monsterfolk cultures.

Just as his doubts surfaced, a monsterfolk student from Myriad Laws University stepped forward. The Golden Core domain he unleashed sent a palpable wave of intimidation through the assembled monsterfolk.

"My name is Shi Yunxiang."

"Consider yourselves lucky. True Monarch Blazing Light has shown mercy by deigning to hire you little beasts."

"I will be conducting your training."

"Let me make one thing clear: I despise monsterfolk..."

Xiong Wenwu glanced around the room and noticed that none of the monsterfolk raised any objections. Clearly, for the assembled applicants, securing employment was paramount; the issue of discrimination could wait.

---

In the Spirit Realm, countless Soul Cultivators erupted in cheers.

Zhao Tianxing gazed at the bonus added to his account, sighing inwardly, "Is this the power of a Quasi-Soul Transformation cultivator? To enhance the Immortal Dao Potential of thousands of people in a single stroke?"

Hu Yuntao stared in shock at the bonus distribution list. "Money... money is pouring out endlessly! The True Monarch is burning his cultivation!"

Grandfather Yingxin shouted, "Overtime! Overtime!" He forwarded the updated bonus rules, adding, "The sooner you complete your production tasks, the bigger the bonus!"

Che Yufei roared, "I can feel True Monarch Blazing Light's power surging into me! I'm going all out! I'll crush every production task ahead!"

A Soul Cultivator echoed, "All out!"

Mo Tianyi bellowed, "The True Monarch is giving us bonuses! What more needs to be said? Let's crush this mission!"

---

Watching the funds drain away at an alarming rate, Ying Xin, the finance manager, felt her heart race with anxiety.

The Great Void Cloud Repository was currently in another phase of expansion. The company's production lines, network points, and distribution channels were all burning through money at a frantic pace, fueled by the Heaven-Piercing Plan, yet generating no new revenue streams.

As the fund depletion notifications flashed across her screen, she couldn't help but ask Zhang Yu, "President Zhang, if we keep giving out bonuses and raises like this, the company's funds will be completely drained again."

Zhang Yu replied, "I'll transfer another sum. Keep issuing them. Let me know if you run short."

As he spoke, images of employee profiles flickered across his eyes, like an ancient emperor reviewing death sentences. But now, he was rapidly approving salary increases.

The Kunxu salary adjustments were a critical matter, and subordinates dared not approve them without Zhang Yu's personal authorization.

Ying Xin thought to herself, "I'm not asking for more funds... I'm worried about how much we're burning through..."

Witnessing the current rate of fund depletion, Ying Xin felt it was far more terrifying than any desperate gamble. The rate of consumption far exceeded the lifespan most people would burn through in a lifetime.

Lady Fortune watched the rapidly dwindling asset figures, her voice filled with anguish. "Enough, Zhang Yu! Enough! Are you trying to kill your two Masters with worry?"

Zhang Yu ignored her, his gaze fixed on the Heaven-Piercing Plan, which was being frantically accelerated, pushing forward relentlessly.

Mass production of the latest generation Great Void Cloud Repositories surged, along with the Heaven-Piercing Cone components needed to retrofit older models.

Shared Great Void Network Points were being deployed across the city at an astonishing rate, their numbers skyrocketing thanks to the Ten Great Universities' terrifying production capacity.

More and more Cultivators were gradually switching to Great Void Cloud Repositories equipped with the Heaven-Piercing Cone function.

Unbeknownst to many, the Heaven-Piercing Plan had reached its final stage.

Zhang Yu looked up at the firmament, thinking to himself, "Next, we need to organize our forces and rally everyone to use the Heaven-Piercing Cone function of their Great Void Cloud Repositories to completely tear open this firmament."

He knew that to shatter the firmament at countless points and trigger its collapse, the Ten Great Universities alone... simply didn't have the numbers.

"We need more people."

"Ten Greats, Upper College, Lower College, Vocational College... the more, the better."

In Zhang Yu's Heaven-Piercing Plan, he aimed to mobilize every possible person, regardless of whether they were current students or graduates, whether they were from the Ten Greats, Upper College, Lower College, or Vocational College, to collectively shatter the firmament.

Simultaneously, each university began employing its own methods to advance the Heaven-Piercing Plan.

The Ten Great Universities abandoned all pretense of secrecy and publicly announced the Heaven-Piercing Plan to the entire populace, urging everyone to converge on Kunxu's Third Layer and collectively activate the Heaven-Piercing Cone function of the Great Void Cloud Repository to tear open the firmament above.

To ensure the plan's success, Heavenly Demon University mandated that all faculty, staff, students from both the main campus and affiliated schools, factory workers, and employees of affiliated companies work unpaid overtime to participate in the Heaven-Piercing Plan.

Netherworld University issued a notice imposing fines on anyone who refused to participate in the Heaven-Piercing Plan.

Vajra University decided to record the names of non-participants, effectively disqualifying them from any future promotions, raises, or advancements.

Immortal Armaments University incorporated participation in the Heaven-Piercing Plan into performance evaluations, directly impacting monthly and annual compensation.

As the universities each displayed their unique Divine Powers, massive crowds began converging toward Kunxu's Third Layer. Some carried newly purchased Great Void Cloud Repositories, while others used modified older versions or rented Shared Great Void units.

The Ten Great Universities' actions quickly alerted the Righteous Qi Alliance.

A relentless barrage of attacks and propaganda assaults descended upon the gathering crowds.

Righteous Qi Alliance cultivators descended from the skies, relentlessly attacking the converging masses.

The Ten Great Universities' powerhouses retaliated, engaging in continuous battles across Kunxu's Second and Third Layers. The region was soon engulfed in flames, fraught with peril.

Yet the Righteous Qi Alliance's propaganda campaign proved even more influential and threatening.

"Everyone!" True Monarch Calculated Deduction roared in the Dark Spirit Realm. "Will you continue to serve the Ten Greats? Are you waiting for the Heavenly Court to descend and claim you?"

"Whether it's the Ten Greats or the Heavenly Court, they don't see you as human beings."

"Only by defeating the Ten Greats and preventing the Heavenly Court's descent can we truly become human — people who won't be driven to bankruptcy, who won't be trampled underfoot, who won't toil their entire lives only to be discarded as worthless Corpse Components."

True Monarch Calculated Deduction said, "You don't have to worry about finding a job, or about going bankrupt from debt. Your Cultivation Realm won't be restricted by certificates or cards, you can break through cultivation realms at will, attend any university you choose, freely learn military-grade cultivation techniques, and even access Immortal Sect-level Techniques. Don't you want to live such a life?"

"Now, you don't need to fight, you don't need to take the lead. All you have to do is refrain from participating in the Heaven-Piercing Plan!"

"Let me reiterate: the Alliance Leader has just issued a new mission. Simply avoid actively participating in the Heaven-Piercing Plan, and you'll receive 100,000 Righteous Qi Value. Everyone, hurry and claim your rewards!"

Meanwhile, True Monarch Junior College shouted in a video, "I've already crushed three Ten Great League Champions like Zhang Yu! Three fucking champions!"

"Yet in the Top Ten System, I'm just a Junior College Student, while someone like Zhang Yu can inherit Soul Transformation assets. How is that fair? Just because he's a Student of the Top Ten, a rich kid, he can effortlessly acquire wealth we couldn't earn in a hundred lifetimes!"

"Is this justice?"

"Once we blow up the Fifth Layer, the Heavenly Court won't be able to find us. So what if they're the Ten Greats? From now on, we can all be Students of the Top Ten! We'll crush them all under our feet!"

"Is this right? Is this reasonable?"

"Here's more good news! The Alliance Leader has announced that all Dark Spirit Realm users will receive another free military-grade cultivation technique of their choice! If you haven't claimed yours yet, hurry and get it now!"

True Monarch Heaven Devourer also released his own video, urging viewers: "Attention, everyone! The Righteous Qi Alliance will soon launch indiscriminate attacks. If you don't want to be killed, register your identity in the Dark Spirit Realm and undergo facial recognition."

"Members whose identities we've verified will be spared from attack."

"When registering, mention my secret code, 'Swallow Heaven Daily,' to gain a rescue opportunity. If you're injured, we'll provide assistance. Hurry and sign up now!"

As the Dark Spirit Realm's propaganda blitz intensified, vast numbers of people were swayed. The influx of people gathering in Kunxu's Third Layer slowed to a trickle.

Zhang Yu frowned at the data statistics. "We've only reached 8% of the required number to collectively pierce the heavens? That's far too low."

Yu Xinghan remarked beside him, "The Dark Spirit Realm's propaganda campaign is relentless, alternating between threats and incentives. Supporting the Heaven-Piercing Plan requires tangible action, while supporting the Righteous Qi Alliance... just requires doing nothing at all."

"The difficulty between these two sides is far too great."

Just then, an alarm blared, and another divine light dimmed in the sky.

"A Soul Transformation from Vajra University..."

Zhang Yu's heart sank. If another Soul Transformation fell, the Ten Greats would be left with only 34, widening the gap with the Righteous Qi Alliance. The rate at which Soul Transformations were falling would likely accelerate.

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's divine light had dimmed to 55% of its original brightness, while Divine Monarch Greenwood's had fallen to 43%.

"Their divine light is fading even faster now," Yu Xinghan murmured, his eyes filled with concern. He knew that even if they breached the firmament, it wouldn't instantly relieve the Soul Transformations or turn the tide of battle.

Yet they hadn't even breached the firmament, and the majority of the public was growing increasingly unwilling to cooperate.

And now, another Soul Transformation...

Suddenly, Yu Xinghan's gaze sharpened. A video popped up in his Bionic Eye, showing the dimming divine light of Divine Lord Steel Wisdom, the Soul Transformation from Vajra University.

Yu Xinghan remembered that Divine Lord Steel Wisdom was a shareholder of the Shedding Flesh Pavilion, constantly promoting it and using the physical bodies of Vajra University students.

Now, in the video, Divine Lord Steel Wisdom appeared pale and gaunt, yet spoke with fervent conviction: "Fellow students, esteemed teachers, I, Divine Lord Steel Wisdom, hereby declare my formal repentance and allegiance to the Righteous Qi Alliance..."

Hearing these words, Yu Xinghan felt a wave of despair wash over him. He could already imagine the public's morale plummeting once again.

A Divine Monarch's defection would undoubtedly be a greater blow to morale than any battlefield defeat.

Meanwhile, on the other side, Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye flickered wildly as messages flooded in from several Nascent Soul True Monarchs at Vajra University.

Without even checking, Zhang Yu knew they were urgently pressing him to unlock the Soul Transformation Hidden Legacy.

He understood that by unlocking this legacy, he would significantly mitigate the morale impact on the leaders of many universities facing the fall of Soul Transformation experts.

However, for the masses, the morale impact was real and would inevitably further hinder the final execution of the Heaven-Piercing Plan.

Sure enough, as Zhang Yu reviewed the data, he immediately noticed that the rate of manpower mobilization had slowed once again.

---

"These damn paupers are utterly useless!" True Monarch String Tone roared, glaring at the dwindling crowds. "Do they really think they'll get anything good if the Righteous Qi Alliance wins? A bunch of fools!"

Suddenly, his face darkened as he saw the news of Divine Lord Steel Wisdom's surrender.

This was the first Human Race Soul Transformation cultivator to surrender, and True Monarch String Tone felt the tide of battle turning against them like an avalanche.

Meanwhile, at Heavenly Demon University, True Monarch Precise Attainment thought to himself, "This won't work. The paupers don't understand the big picture and can't be mobilized. The Heaven-Piercing Plan is doomed. At least I've made a decent profit."

He gazed at the increasingly unstable divine light in the sky, thinking, "Maybe it's time to retreat. The longer I wait, the more dangerous it becomes."

Arriving at the Grand Void, Wang Yin sighed. "Now that the first surrender has happened, the remaining Divine Monarchs... will likely start scheming for their own survival."

"Mother..." He stared at the divine light representing Divine Monarch Nether Spring, his eyes filled with worry. "What choice will you make?"

As the situation deteriorated further, the Ten Great Universities were plunged into chaos.

---

Within the Dark Spirit Realm, in a conference room, projections of various figures converged: Evil Gods, Demonic Sect Cultivators, former Finance Department Cultivators, Rebel Cultivators...

Apart from the Divine Monarchs still locked in fierce combat on the Soul Transformation Battlefield, nearly all the Righteous Qi Alliance's powerhouses had descended.

Zhang Yu, summoned by the Evil God Register through Lady Fortune, had also arrived.

True Monarch Junior College chuckled, "Junior College Students are so easily deceived. We don't need to genuinely care for them; just make them believe the Righteous Qi Alliance has won, and they'll think their lives will improve."

True Monarch Calculated Deduction said coldly, "A bunch of paupers. They'll believe anything you tell them. They deserve to be poor forever."

Zhang Yu, who had entered the conference room with Lady Fortune, listened to the cultivators' conversation and mentally asked her, "Can you record this?"

Lady Fortune replied, "How could I? This place is heavily encrypted and monitored by so many Evil Gods. It's too risky."

"Besides, even if we leaked it, what good would it do? They'd just claim it's fake. We're losing the propaganda war; nothing we say matters anymore."

Zhang Yu remained silent, continuing to listen to the meeting.

Divine Monarch Great Devourer declared, "When are we attacking Celestial Monsters University? Thieves are stealing my assets! We must stop them immediately!"

"And those who acted recklessly in my absence — Zhang Yu and the monsterfolk who stole my property — must be captured!"

But no one paid attention to the Divine Monarch, whose Primordial Qi was severely depleted and whose strength had greatly diminished.

True Monarch Heaven Devourer continued, "Zhang Yu's Heaven-Piercing Plan has already failed, hasn't it? Is there anything else we need to do?"

With that, True Monarch Heaven Devourer and everyone else turned to look at True Monarch Immortal Slayer, who sat in the main seat of the conference room.

True Monarch Immortal Slayer's immense cultivation and status as a disciple of Fu Xiantian ensured he commanded the respect of everyone present, and they implicitly looked to him for leadership.

Within True Monarch Immortal Slayer's Bionic Eye, information about the Ten Greats, the Heaven-Piercing Plan, and Zhang Yu constantly surfaced.

"The Heaven-Piercing Plan... Zhang Yu? Hmph."

A cold glint flashed in True Monarch Immortal Slayer's eyes as he recalled the outcome of his master Fu Xiantian's personal conversation with Zhang Yu.

He thought to himself, "A useless fool with no capacity... Grandmaster misjudged him. What right does this wretch have to be considered Master's equal?"

Aloud, he declared, "The Heaven-Piercing Plan has utterly failed."

"However... some stubborn fools have still set out."

"Excellent. This is the perfect opportunity to wipe them all out."

With a flick of his finger, maps materialized before the assembled cultivators. "Attack from these positions. Kill as many as you can..."

Hearing True Monarch Immortal Slayer's words, Zhang Yu's heart stirred. "This plan is nothing more than slaughter for slaughter's sake. As Fu Xiantian's disciple, True Monarch Immortal Slayer must know the truth about the plan. Does he truly agree with wiping out everyone from the Second to Fifth Layers?"

---

After Zhang Yu's consciousness returned, he immediately wrote down the detailed attack plan he had just memorized. He then deployed personnel to prepare defenses, aiming to repel the enemy's assault and minimize casualties.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu observed the gradually dimming Soul Transformation Divine Light. Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's divine light had fallen to 53%, while Divine Monarch Greenwood's had dropped to 41%.

Yet the number of participants required for the Heaven-Piercing Plan had only reached 12%.

The situation continued to deteriorate.

Zhang Yu understood that even if he could repel one or two enemy attacks, it would be meaningless as long as the situation continued to worsen.

Watching the increasingly slow trickle of people gathering, he gradually steeled his resolve.

Zhang Yu realized that at this critical juncture, propaganda, ideology, promises, or even punishment and coercion were becoming increasingly ineffective.

"To mobilize the Myriad Kunxu People now..."

"To rally them to pierce the firmament... the best, the most effective method... only one remained."

"Just that one."

When Lady Fortune saw Zhang Yu's plan for the Great Void Red Envelope, her vision blurred and her head swam. "Zhang... Zhang Yu! Are you mad? You're going to give money to everyone... to every single person?"

"This isn't just a few thousand or tens of thousands of employees from your company."

"This is millions, tens of millions, possibly even hundreds of millions of people! You're going to evaporate all of the Soul Transformation assets?!"

If the last time — when Zhang Yu gave bonuses and raises to his employees — had already made Lady Fortune's heart bleed, this time, merely looking at the plan's details made her feel like her dao heart was shattering.

Zhang Yu said, "This is the only way to turn the tide. What use is all this money if everyone dies?"

As the Soul Transformation assets surged, a massive torrent of funds erupted skyward. With absolute brute force and violence, Zhang Yu's avatar hijacked every advertisement, every platform's headline, his image practically descending before the bionic eyes of every person.

Tian Shengong, witnessing this spectacle, exclaimed in shock, "How much is he spending?! What message could possibly warrant such a display?"

In the Dark Spirit Realm, True Monarch Immortal Slayer, who had been observing the battle, sneered. "What's the point of talking to everyone? A desperate struggle."

Lady Fortune wailed, "Ahhh! No, Zhang Yu! You're trying to save them, but why are you giving away money? Why are you giving away money?!"

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu addressed the crowd: "Everyone, I am True Monarch Blazing Light of Myriad Laws University, currently the wealthiest person among the Ten Great Universities, excluding those at the Soul Transformation stage."

"Now, I need all of you to break through the firmament with me and turn the tide of this battle. But I know your strength is insufficient — you're all too poor."

"Therefore, I've decided to give you my power! I'll give money to everyone who breaks through the firmament!"

"Come! Everyone! Come and claim your money!"

"What the Righteous Qi Alliance can't provide, what the Ten Greats can't provide — I'll give it all to you today!"

"As long as you use the Great Void Cloud Repository to break through the firmament, these Great Void Red Envelopes are yours!"

In the next moment, Zhang Yu pointed a finger at the sky and declared, "Money! Come!"

Under countless shocked gazes, a massive amount of funds transformed into a sky-filling rain of red envelopes, surging upward like a crimson dragon, piercing the heavens through the bionic eyes of the masses.
