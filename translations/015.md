# Chapter 15: The Central Tower

Upon hearing the words "Golden Core True Monarch," Zhao Tianxing gave a slight start in the car, then said in disbelief,

"How could the daughter of a Golden Core True Monarch possibly come to Songyang?"

Zhang Yu nodded slightly at his side. He knew that Foundation Establishment came after Qi Refinement, and Golden Core came after Foundation Establishment.

To reach the Golden Core realm, one would have to graduate from a top-tier high school, successfully enroll in one of the Ten Greats, and rise through the ranks of a major sect; who knew how many levels of Kunxu one would have to climb.

The daughter of such a figure would be born on the second level of Kunxu at the very least, so how could she possibly come to a first-level place like Songyang City?

The driver smiled upon hearing this, and as if wanting to show off, he said slowly, "And you think Ms. Li Xuelian is the only one coming to our Songyang City?"

"They say her father, True Monarch Xinghuo, is originally from our Songyang City. He’s retiring now and plans to return to Songyang City to live out his golden years…"

Zhang Yu found this odd. A Golden Core expert retiring to the starter village?

The driver continued, "This art exhibition features more than just Ms. Li’s paintings. I heard there’s also a piece called the ‘Celestial Paragon’s Martial Demonstration Scroll,’ personally painted by True Monarch Xinghuo, which is said to hide a peerless martial art."

"Of the people coming to this exhibition, aside from those hoping to connect with Ms. Li, many others want a chance to comprehend the Martial Ascension Scroll and master the peerless martial art hidden within."

...

Songyang Central Tower.

The 999th floor.

Zhang Yu stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking down in awe at the roiling sea of clouds beneath his feet. It was the first time he had ever stood at such a height, gazing down upon the entire city.

He adjusted the new security uniform he was wearing, a wave of emotion washing over him.

Ever since entering the Central Tower, Zhang Yu felt as though he had stepped into another, dreamlike world.

If the suburban district where he lived was somewhat reminiscent of his past life, then the infrastructure of Songyang High School had already surpassed that world in nearly every aspect, and as for the Central Tower before him…

Whether it was the terrifying height of its 999 floors or the various Immortal Dao technologies suffused with flowing mana within, the entire place was like something from a fantasy.

Recalling how he had been pulled up to the 999th floor in seconds by a formation array, empowered by Daoist arts, yet emerging completely unscathed, Zhang Yu couldn't help but be moved once more.

"All part of Songyang City, yet mortals live in the suburbs, cultivators gather in the city center, and this Central Tower… this is the domain of the truly wealthy."

"Three places, all within the same city, yet they feel like three separate, stratified worlds…"

Just then, Zhao Tianxing’s voice sounded from behind him. 

"Zhang Yu, the captain told us to start our patrol. Shouldn't we get going?"

Zhang Yu turned to see Zhao Tianxing standing behind him, also dressed in a security uniform.

But unlike Zhang Yu’s composure, Zhao Tianxing was incredibly awkward and timid… looking utterly pathetic, as if he were in agony.

He felt like a clown in this uniform, and imagined the gazes of everyone around him were filled with disdain, contempt, and scorn.

In truth, Zhao Tianxing was overthinking things. Once he put on the uniform, he was no longer just a commoner, but had become part of the tower's background, his presence in most people's eyes barely more noticeable than the greenery.

Zhang Yu clapped him on the shoulder.

"Chest out, head up. We’re security for the Central Tower now, not delivery boys. What’s there to be afraid of?"

Sensing that the passersby had been drawn by Zhang Yu’s voice, Zhao Tianxing said hurriedly, "I get it, Zhang Yu, just keep your voice down. Don’t bother the other guests."

The art exhibition was quite large, occupying a space of over a thousand square meters and providing drinks and a buffet. To Zhang Yu, it seemed less like an art show and more like a social gala.

The legendary Celestial Paragon’s Martial Demonstration Scroll was currently covered by a large cloth, which, according to rumor, would be personally unveiled by Ms. Li Xuelian.

Zhang Yu and Zhao Tianxing were assigned to patrol a section near the edge of the venue.

With the exhibition yet to officially begin, the patrol was incredibly relaxed, and it didn't trigger his ritual’s backlash either.

After all, the ritual’s power was directed toward the fulfillment of a wish.

His method for fulfilling that wish was to study, cultivate, and work hard to get into a university and earn money… all to ultimately grant the evil god’s desire.

A temporary job like this was part of earning money and even of his studies and cultivation, so the ritual’s power wouldn't compel him to do something else.

In fact, this state of aimless wandering was a far, far more relaxing experience for Zhang Yu than the last few days of arduous training had been.

Just then, as the two neared the dining tables, they saw a group of servers arranging plates and setting out table decorations.

Zhang Yu glanced over at the dishes being laid out plate by plate and asked in surprise, "Is that… seafood?"

Zhao Tianxing looked over as well, his eyes falling on the abalone and lobster.

"They’re sea creatures. I saw the one with the shell when I was out with my mom. I think a single pound costs thirty or forty thousand."

"But this is the Central Tower, so having things like this is probably normal."

Zhang Yu had seen and eaten plenty of seafood in his past life.

But here in Kunxu, at least on the first level, sea creatures were an extreme rarity. The original Zhang Yu had only ever seen them online and had certainly never eaten, or even laid eyes on, them in real life.

This was simply because within the twenty-million-plus square kilometers of Kunxu's first level… there were no oceans.

It was said that the sea creatures available on the market were either imported from the upper levels of Kunxu or farmed by organizations in their own artificial marine environments.

Hearing the price of tens of thousands for a single pound from Zhao Tianxing, Zhang Yu was inwardly stunned.

"So expensive?"

"What's the benefit of eating this stuff? Does it increase your mana?"

It was no wonder Zhang Yu thought this way. In the Immortal Dao world he knew, both as his former and current self, everyone was striving to advance by any means necessary, pushing themselves to their limits to improve their mana, martial prowess, Daoist arts, physical bodies, and Dao hearts.

Clothing, food, housing, transportation… every aspect of life was inextricably linked to raising one's cultivation.

"Benefits?" Zhao Tianxing thought for a moment before shaking his head. "I’ve never heard of any benefits. I think it’s just for the taste."

"Just for the taste?" Zhang Yu stared, slightly stunned, at the platters of fine food on the table.

Just as Zhang Yu and Zhao Tianxing were furtively inspecting the dining tables, a cold voice suddenly spoke from behind them.

"You two are security. What are you doing skulking around here instead of patrolling?"

The voice startled Zhao Tianxing, who spun around and hastily explained, "We weren’t doing anything…"

But when he saw who it was, Zhao Tianxing froze on the spot.

Zhang Yu, however, turned around casually, looked at Bai Zhenzhen, and said, "Well, if it isn’t Zhen. Fancy seeing you at an art exhibition."

Meanwhile, upon realizing the newcomer was a classmate, Zhao Tianxing felt the security uniform on his body become unbearably ugly. He squirmed uncomfortably, looking like he might burst at any moment.

He squirmed even more as he imagined what would happen if word got out at school that he was working as a security guard. Labels like ‘poor,’ ‘part-timer,’ and ‘broke’ would be slapped on him by his classmates, and his status and reputation in his social circle would plummet.

Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhang Yu, her face devoid of expression.

"I didn’t realize you two were so eager to get ahead in life that you’d skip decades of struggle and jump straight to being security guards."

Zhao Tianxing waved his hands frantically.

"No, that’s not it, Classmate Bai Zhenzhen! I just came along with Zhang Yu."

But Zhang Yu clapped a hand firmly on Zhao Tianxing’s shoulder.

"What are you so flustered about? You’re a temporary security guard earning 800 an hour, with enough purchasing power in a single hour to cover a mortal's food and drink for ten days. Do you have any idea how many people would kill for that?"

"Huh?" Zhao Tianxing was taken aback. He had never considered an 800-per-hour wage to be anything special.

But as he looked at Bai Zhenzhen, who had suddenly fallen silent, he felt a distinct chill coming from her.

Zhao Tianxing had never been very familiar with the genius girl who ranked first in their grade, knowing only that she was always cold and unapproachable and exclusively ate lunch with Zhang Yu and Zhou Tianyi.

In fact, Zhao Tianxing’s own social circle had tried inviting her out, but they never received a response.

In his mind, Bai Zhenzhen was a prodigy of immense talent, but also incredibly arrogant and difficult to get close to.

Now, seeing her silent and expressionless, Zhao Tianxing could only assume she was angry.

*Zhang Yu must have angered her with his careless words.*

Just as he was fidgeting and racking his brain for something to say to diffuse the tension, he heard Bai Zhenzhen ask coldly, "You make 800 an hour?"

"Yeah," Zhao Tianxing nodded dumbly, not understanding her point.

At that moment, a voice called out from the other side of the tables, where a server was setting up.

"New girl! Get over here and bring out the dishes! What are you standing around for?"

Bai Zhenzhen said to Zhang Yu and Zhao Tianxing, "I have to go serve the food. We’ll talk later."

Meanwhile, she was thinking, *Damn it! Security guards make 800 an hour? I only make 500! I would’ve signed up for security if I’d known.*

Only then did Zhao Tianxing notice that Bai Zhenzhen was wearing the exact same uniform as the other servers.

"Bai Zhenzhen is working here, too?" he asked, his face a mask of shock.

"Is that so strange? Who in this world isn't working for someone else?" Zhang Yu had recognized her uniform at a glance. Given Bai Zhenzhen's financial situation, he thought it was perfectly normal for her to have a job.

He was, however, secretly amazed that she could still maintain her rank as first in the grade while working a part-time job.

*Zhen’s talent is truly something else. Among all the new disciples of my Songyang Sect, she’s probably second only to me.*
