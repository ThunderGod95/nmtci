# Chapter 448: The Seven Absolutes Opportunity and the Anti-Intelligence Wave

669th Floor.

In a corner of the construction site, Shi Yunxiang stopped Che Yufei, a man with snow-white hair, and asked, "Old Che, why have you aged so much again? And lately, I've noticed you've been avoiding me and Zhang Yu. What's going on?"

Che Yufei paused, turned to face Shi Yunxiang, and gave a helpless smile. "I just... I'm too ashamed to face you."

As Che Yufei slowly explained, Shi Yunxiang learned that he had bought Jade Nectar Coins.

Shi Yunxiang couldn't help but scold, "Didn't I tell you to sell them? Didn't you promise?"

Che Yufei sighed. "But the price kept rising... and rising..."

"And then I made a profit from buying a spot on the Competition Team, so I couldn't resist investing in it."

"I only planned to hold them for three days..."

"Did you use leverage?" Shi Yunxiang asked.

Che Yufei nodded bitterly. "It had been rising for so long. Why did it have to crash when I bought in?"

"Yunxiang, the Immortal Dao is truly difficult."

"I've cultivated diligently for nearly thirty years, enduring countless trials on the immortal path, resisting endless temptations. And just once... just once I couldn't hold back, and everything I'd achieved crumbled to dust."

Listening to Che Yufei's words, Shi Yunxiang opened his mouth, unsure how to respond.

He recalled his own journey — sleepless nights, meager meals, and complete devotion to the Immortal Dao.

Why should someone like Che Yufei, who had endured so much, lose everything simply because he succumbed to temptation once? Why should his immortal path shatter, leaving him no chance to climb higher?

Che Yufei patted Shi Yunxiang's shoulder. "Yunxiang, don't follow my example."

"The Immortal Dao demands absolute commitment. Either endure until your soul scatters, or don't tread this path at all. Don't be like me — unable to resist temptation, ultimately abandoning the journey halfway."

In that instant, a beam of Divine Light descended.

Watching the light fall, Che Yufei sighed. "The Righteous God has come to claim me."

Shi Yunxiang stared silently as Che Yufei vanished into the Divine Light, finally exhaling a long sigh.

Soon after, the members of the Competition Team learned of Che Yufei's fate and attended his memorial service in the Spirit Realm.

Shi Huaiyu watched the price trend of the Jade Nectar Coin, sighing helplessly.

"Ah, all my gains have vanished again."

"At least I didn't use leverage."

Shi Huaiyu planned to continue investing, but instead of focusing on the Jade Nectar Coin, she turned her attention to other currencies, particularly those associated with the three Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs of Myriad Laws University.

"I really need to trade some stable coins."

Suddenly, her bionic eye caught news about Che Yufei. She paused, then shook her head with a wry smile. "Leverage really is dangerous."

"If I hadn't lost so badly before, I might have tried leverage this time too, and ended up just like Old Che."

---

Su Yanyang watched the members of the Competition Team discuss Che Yufei, but he didn't join the conversation. After all, he barely knew Che Yufei and felt no particular emotion about the situation.

However, skimming through the messages reminded him of the Jade Nectar Coin incident, and Su Yanyang suddenly felt a surge of relief.

Earlier, he had followed Zhang Yu's advice and cashed out early, making a decent profit. But as the Jade Nectar Coin's value continued to soar, he couldn't resist investing a bit more.

He had been secretly regretting his losses, but seeing Che Yufei's fate, Su Yanyang now felt fortunate that his own situation wasn't worse.

---

Seeing the news of Che Yufei's bankruptcy and subsequent transformation into a Soul Cultivator, Gongshu Jin muttered to himself, "Phew, good thing I spent almost all my money buying a Seven Absolutes spot."

Ying Xin sighed inwardly, "Thank goodness Father, Grandfather, Great-Grandfather, and Great-Great-Grandfather all stopped me from investing."

Meanwhile, others who hadn't profited from Jade Nectar Coins were also in good spirits.

"Good thing I'm too poor to speculate on coins!" Li Xiao laughed heartily, thinking, "Now there are fewer competitors for the exam, and my class ranking just jumped up two spots!"

---

In the days that followed, Zhang Yu focused on his studies and cultivation, occasionally training with Mo Shangjin's teammates to prepare for the Inter-University League starting next month.

Before he knew it, early December had arrived.

On this particular day, Zhang Yu was using his reimbursed 30 Spirit Coins to craft his fourth Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill through a self-commissioned artifact crafting order.

Suddenly, he received a message from Zhang Pianpian.

Zhang Pianpian: Mo Shangjin from your department, along with another teammate, has been severely injured in the wilderness.

Zhang Yu was shocked. Mo Shangjin went to a wilderness construction site for a project. How could someone with Military-Grade Martial Arts get seriously injured?

Zhang Pianpian: A conflict erupted among the Upper Colleges, involving Golden Core True Persons. Mo Shangjin was caught in the crossfire.

Zhang Pianpian: There's evidence of involvement from other universities. Mo Shangjin might have been targeted in a retaliatory act.

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened. Retaliation?

Zhang Pianpian didn't answer his question directly. Instead, she said, In any case, you'll definitely become a key member of the Civil Engineering Department's team now.

Zhang Pianpian: Be careful.

Zhang Pianpian: But this is also an opportunity.

Several days later, Zhang Yu heard more details about Mo Shangjin's injuries.

Reportedly, both Mo Shangjin and his teammate were severely wounded and would require at least two to three months to recover.

This left the Civil Engineering Department's original team in disarray. With two members caught in the Jade Nectar Coin collapse and two others critically injured, only Zhang Yu and one other official team member remained.

---

Within the Spirit Realm, True Monarch Cloud Haven gazed at Director Gao, Director Lin, and the Old Director before him. "Mo Shangjin won't recover in time. What's our next move?"

When none of the three spoke, True Monarch Cloud Haven snorted coldly. "Silence? Then I'll make the selections myself."

"Besides Zhang Yu, Xiao Yunji and Su Yanyang, who also participated in the Military Certificate Examination, will join the team. You can fill the remaining spots."

"This time, I don't want to hear any excuses about 'this faction' or 'that faction.'"

"If you can't assemble a full team, we'll be eliminated by the Civil Engineering teams from the Thirty-Six Upper Colleges. You'll lose face, and I won't be able to face the three Divine Monarchs."

The Old Director smiled faintly. "As long as Old Gao agrees, it's fine. I just worry he might not want our students taking up valuable spots for extra credit."

Director Gao scoffed. "Principal, with Mo Shangjin severely injured and Zhang Yu yet to master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, he can't carry the team alone."

"I think we should accelerate Zhang Yu's training in the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power."

Director Lin raised an eyebrow. "The Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power is a major undertaking. Each of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering must follow proper procedures."

Director Gao waved his hand dismissively, his anger flaring. "Is this the time for formalities? For the sake of the university's and the Civil Engineering Department's honor, shouldn't we take extraordinary measures in these critical times?"

Director Lin countered, "Zhang Yu is only a third-year student, yet he's already mastered five of the Absolutes."

"I heard you've even arranged for him to learn the Sixth Absolute, Director Gao."

"Heh, if we add the Seventh Absolute, that would mean teaching him four Absolutes in just half a year. It would surely raise eyebrows."

"People might start thinking the Civil Engineering Department belongs to the Zhang family."

Director Gao roared, "Director Lin! I've done everything for the Civil Engineering Department with a clear conscience. You're the one dragging your feet. Do you want to see our team eliminated? Does your heart still belong to Civil Engineering, or has it already flown to the Finance Department?"

Director Lin snapped, "Gao Chongguang! Stop changing the subject! What does the Finance Department have to do with this? Your disciple caused trouble outside and was severely injured. You bear full responsibility for that."

The Old Director stood motionless to the side, listening to their argument, his thoughts seemingly drifting deep into the Spirit Realm as he attended to other matters.

In the next instant, a Silence Talisman lit up, silencing both speakers.

Director Gao and Director Lin stopped abruptly, turning to True Monarch Cloud Haven.

True Monarch Cloud Haven, having retracted the Silence Talisman, said calmly, "Teaching four Absolutes in such a short time doesn't quite follow protocol."

"Since the Civil Engineering League has been restructured with exams in December, which will take several months, right?"

"Old Lin, arrange for Zhang Yu to participate in your Seven Civil Engineering Techniques in January and pass on the Seventh Absolute to him."

"That way, the four Absolutes will be taught across two years. No objections?"

Director Lin opened his mouth, then stared at the intense lightning radiating from True Monarch Cloud Haven's cloud-like form. Finally, he nodded. "I have no further objections."

Director Gao breathed a sigh of relief, thinking to himself that with Zhang Yu mastering the Sixth Absolute in December and the Seventh Absolute in January, he would soon be able to wield the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

Mid-December.

A Flying Boat soared from Myriad Laws University City, piercing the sky and streaking toward the horizon.

Inside the Flying Boat's cultivation chamber, Zhang Yu silently practiced the Sixth Absolute: Transmuting Earth into Gold, which he had mastered just days prior.

He didn't need to execute it perfectly; even flawed attempts would advance Feather Book's cultivation progress.

Soon, the Flying Boat arrived at its destination: Golden River University, one of the Thirty-Six Upper Colleges and Myriad Laws University's first opponent in this year's Civil Engineering Inter-University League.

Unlike Myriad Laws University City, Golden River University resembled a typical metropolis, its dense grid of skyscrapers forming rectangular blocks across the plains.

As Zhang Yu gazed down at the demolished teaching buildings below, a flicker of surprise crossed his face. "What's going on here?"

Xiao Qingxuan, standing beside him, explained, "The recent Financial Storm hit Golden River University particularly hard, reaching a 3rd-tier intensity."

"I heard many buildings were torn down and sold off."

Zhang Yu exclaimed, "A 3rd-tier Financial Storm?"

Xiao Qingxuan nodded. "It's likely due to Golden River University's Dual Cultivation Department. The Financial Storms here tend to be more severe."

He surveyed the vast swaths of demolished city below and sighed. "A 3rd-tier Financial Storm isn't so bad. If it had reached an 8th-tier intensity, even Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs would risk perishing."

As the Flying Boat descended, Zhang Yu gradually gained a clearer view of Golden River University's interior.

"So many people missing limbs," Zhang Yu remarked.

At that moment, Mo Shangjin's Spirit Realm Projection materialized beside him. "After a 3rd-tier Financial Storm, it's not unusual for people to sell off parts of their dismembered bodies."

"Look over there!" Zhang Yu pointed to a distant crowd gathered around what appeared to be a bonfire. "What are they doing now?"

"Smashing Yin Artifacts," Mo Shangjin replied.

Zhang Yu was stunned. "Smashing what?"

Mo Shangjin explained, "The Jade Nectar Coin incident has triggered an Anti-Intelligence Artifact wave in many universities with Dual Cultivation Departments."

"Some students are protesting by burning and smashing Intelligent Yin Artifacts and Yang Artifacts."

"Others are taking advantage of the chaos, falsely accusing people of using these artifacts, demanding they be removed for inspection, and then confiscating them..."

"Isn't anyone stopping them?" Zhang Yu exclaimed.

Mo Shangjin shook his head. "This Anti-Intelligence Artifact movement is likely being orchestrated by Soul Cultivation Companies. The waters run deep."

"If we enter Golden River University, won't they search us?" Zhang Yu asked.

Mo Shangjin burst into laughter. "This dump of a school? How dare they try to search us?"
