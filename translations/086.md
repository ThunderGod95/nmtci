# Chapter 86: The Photoshoot and a Lesson for He Dayou

Several days after the martial arts competition had ended, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen finally landed an advertisement—a group commercial featuring several of the contestants.

Walking down the road, Zhang Yu couldn't help but ask, "Did you hear what Song Hailong said yesterday? Why did he, the third-place winner, get a solo ad while we only got a group one?"

Bai Zhenzhen pursed her lips and said, "I asked around, and the general consensus is... it's been half a year since school started, and in another six months, we'll be second-years."

"No one's offering us solo ads because they're afraid our public image will collapse."

Hearing Bai Zhenzhen's answer, Zhang Yu was completely baffled. "Collapse? How could our image possibly collapse? Are they worried we'll mess around with our fans?"

Bai Zhenzhen shot Zhang Yu a sidelong glance, stating the obvious, "What nonsense are you talking about? Messing with fans is nothing. They're worried our grades will plummet once we become second-years. We're the poor kids, after all."

Zhang Yu understood instantly. For a top student in Kunxu, a collapsed image meant falling grades. It made perfect sense.

But then, anger flared within him. "Does being poor automatically mean our grades will collapse in our second year? We're already poor enough, and now it's even harder for us to make money than a rich kid like Song Hailong. He can get a solo ad, but we can't. Speaking of which, why did they ask us to be in the group ad then? Aren't they afraid our images will collapse?"

Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhang Yu as if he were an idiot. "Are you stupid? In a group ad, if our images collapse, they can just edit us out."

A little over half an hour later, the two arrived at a photography studio and saw that many familiar faces from the three great high schools were already there.

But at that moment, all of them were, intentionally or not, glancing at a certain teenager who was surrounded by a dozen staff members.

Bai Zhenzhen asked, intrigued, "Who's that? He's got quite the entourage."

Zhang Yu was also curious. "Isn't this supposed to be a group ad for the top eight from the martial arts competition? I don't think he was one of them."

Lian Tianji popped up from behind them and said, "That's Yu Xinghan, True Monarch Xinghuo's final disciple, whom he found in another city. He's probably transferring to White Dragon High School soon."

Looking at the boy who was the center of everyone's attention, surrounded by assistants, makeup artists, and directors, Bai Zhenzhen's gaze shifted.

"True Monarch Xinghuo? You mean that washed-up Golden Core?"

Lian Tianji nodded at her words. "According to True Monarch Xinghuo, this Yu Xinghan is to be his final disciple, inheriting his entire legacy and fortune. He's predicted to be Songyang City's future top scorer on the college entrance exams."

"It's because of his title as a Golden Core's disciple, along with such high praise, that the Immortal Resonance Group brought him in for this ad."

"Look at Song Hailong, hehe... his eyes are practically shooting sparks. After all, this Yu Xinghan is transferring to White Dragon High School and will inevitably compete with him for the top spot in their year."

Zhang Yu looked at Song Hailong, who resembled nothing more than a stressed-out calico cat, his back arched and fur on end as he stared daggers at Yu Xinghan.

A thought flickered in Zhang Yu's mind, and he suddenly said, "So this Yu Xinghan will have to participate in the upcoming competitions, right?"

Lian Tianji nodded. "Of course. In the next athletics competition, he'll likely be a strong contender for the championship."

As he looked toward Yu Xinghan, a flicker of challenge ignited in his own eyes.

While Lian Tianji was talking with Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, a pair of eyes was quietly watching the three of them.

The owner of that gaze was none other than Le Mulan from Purple Cloud High School.

Originally, Le Mulan had no interest in this kind of advertisement shoot, but she had come for two reasons. First, the Golden Core's disciple, Yu Xinghan, would be participating, and she was curious about him.

Second... was because of the only two poor students among the contestants, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen.

As she watched the two, Le Mulan thought to herself, _I've been looking at the photos he posts online every day, and I don't find them as disgusting as I used to. This is a good opportunity to take things a step further._

But the mere thought of approaching Zhang Yu brought back the image of him sitting on top of her, the dirty, hot, reeking blood splashing all over her body, and an involuntary shudder sent goosebumps across her skin.

_Forget it, I'll start with the easiest step first._

_Besides, I'll have to get close to them during the actual shoot anyway._

So Le Mulan silently observed the pair, her gaze continuously drifting in their direction.

...

The commercial they were filming involved the various contestants recommending the Immortal Resonance Group's tutoring agency.

During the shoot, people constantly found opportunities to approach Yu Xinghan to chat and add him as a friend, giving Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen a firsthand taste of how incredibly popular a true Golden Core's disciple was.

As for the central focus of the entire advertisement, that was completely occupied by Yu Xinghan, with the other contestants arranged around him like green leaves encircling a flower.

However, the top three from the martial arts competition—Zhang Yu, Le Mulan, and Song Hailong—were the leaves right beside the flower. Fourth place, Bai Zhenzhen, was like the stem beneath the leaves, and those ranked even lower, like Lian Tianji, were the dirt beneath the flower.

According to the director, the words "Final Disciple of a Golden Core True Monarch" would eventually fill the entire screen; he was the undisputed star.

During the shoot, Zhang Yu felt that Le Mulan, who was standing beside him, was acting strangely. One moment she would take a deep breath, the next she would be trembling slightly. He finally couldn't help but ask, "What are you doing?"

Seeing Zhang Yu turn his head, Le Mulan instinctively took a step back.

"You... I'm fine. Mind your own business."

Zhang Yu cursed her as a psycho in his head and decided to ignore her.

Le Mulan, however, was covering her nose, thinking, _He smells awful... is this what Mom called the 'subway smell' that poor people have?_

_It was definitely the right decision to come today. I can already feel myself slowly getting used to it._

After four hours, the commercial was finally finished. Zhang Yu took his 30,000 yuan and Bai Zhenzhen her 8,000, and they each went home.

But not long after he got home, Zhang Yu's newly acquired 30,000 yuan transformed into a Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill, which he swallowed in one gulp.

Feeling a violent medicinal power coursing through his entire body, Zhang Yu immediately seized the opportunity to begin cultivating the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

As the power of the pill spread through his limbs and organs, Zhang Yu felt every muscle, organ, and even bone in his body, like parched earth receiving sweet rain, begin to frantically absorb the medicinal energy as he circulated the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

A full half-hour passed before the medicinal power slowly dissipated within him.

But Zhang Yu knew it wasn't truly gone; it had been temporarily absorbed into his muscles, organs, and bones.

At that moment, although Zhang Yu didn't feel any increase in his physical strength, he felt vigorous and brimming with inexhaustible energy.

He knew that over the next few days, the medicinal power he had absorbed would continue to take effect, enhancing his cultivation of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi and further increasing his physical strength.

He eagerly continued to cultivate the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

As the entire night passed, with Zhang Yu frantically cultivating the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, he would train until he was completely exhausted, collapse, and the moment the ritual urged him on, he knew he could train again and would get back up to continue.

Under such extreme training, his physical strength level jumped from 1.67 to 1.70.

"What a good booster, a truly good booster. It's expensive for a reason."

...

For the next few days, Zhang Yu seized every second to cultivate the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, trying to increase his physical strength as much as possible before the medicinal power completely faded.

At times, Zhang Yu couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder. "Kunxu, you really turn people into monsters. I'm actually pushing myself this hard now. I haven't heard the ritual's nagging for three straight days."

And during this training process, Zhang Yu could feel his body growing stronger, bit by bit, every single moment.

_After all, fully utilizing a level 10 Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi is something that, by all rights, only a top third-year student should be capable of._

_But now I'm using it to enhance my level 1.7 physical strength. It's like a max-level character returning to the newbie village to level up. The progress is truly astounding._

In just three short days, as the medicinal power was depleted, his physical strength increased continuously, rising from level 1.70 to 1.87.

At this moment, Zhang Yu stood in the classroom, feeling the last of the medicinal power being completely wrung out of him. He sighed inwardly, his craving for money growing ever stronger.

_In Kunxu... you really can't get anywhere without money._

Just as he was thinking this, the voice of the combat instructor, Lei Jun, broke through his reverie.

"Zhang Yu, He Dayou, you two will spar."

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback. In combat class, he was almost always paired with Bai Zhenzhen. Why was he with He Dayou this time?

A King-tier player versus a Stubborn Bronze? What was Old Lei thinking?

Lei Jun's intention was simple: he hoped Zhang Yu would teach He Dayou a lesson. He Dayou's performance in combat class recently had been far too arrogant.

_He just rampages around with his newly increased physical strength, completely disregarding the combat techniques I've taught._

And so, Lei Jun dispatched his top general, Zhang Yu, intending for him to show He Dayou the importance of combat techniques and martial skills.

He Dayou approached Zhang Yu with a dark expression, thinking, _After this period of implantation and adaptation training, my physical strength should be far superior to Zhang Yu's. But this kid's combat skills are too strong..._

While He Dayou was still scheming, he saw Zhang Yu strike out with his palm.

He subconsciously raised a hand to block, only to find that Zhang Yu had grabbed his hand and was challenging him to a contest of strength.

"What!" He Dayou was first shocked, then overjoyed. "You dare to compete in strength with the me of today?"

He Dayou's other hand shot out to grab his opponent, and their hands locked together. As their mana clashed, they each unleashed the power of their bodies.

With a furious roar, He Dayou intended to lift Zhang Yu up and hurl him out of the designated area.

But in the next moment, He Dayou felt as if his opponent's hands were carved from rock; under his full force, they didn't move an inch.
