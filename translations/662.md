# Chapter 662: Award Ceremony, Dao Qiankun

One hour remained until the award ceremony began.

Zhang Yu stood at the bow of the Flying Boat, gazing at the floating continent in the distance, his eyes reflecting a myriad of thoughts.

He wanted to speak with Lady Fortune, but feared that under the intense scrutiny of the moment, his identity as a believer of the Evil God would be exposed.

Nor could he fully confide in Zhang Pianpian, True Person Starfire, Director Gao, or even Bai Zhenzhen, unable to reveal the many secrets weighing on his heart.

As he watched advertisements for Immortal Dao Technologies like the Dharma Realm and Longevity Extension flash across the sky, Zhang Yu knew the Soul Transformation cultivators were subtly reminding him of their presence.

In fact, as the ceremony drew nearer and Zhang Yu remained noncommittal, the Soul Transformation cultivators from various schools had begun to exert increasing pressure on him, subtly influencing his choice of Immortal Sect Technique.

Messages of support from his former teachers and classmates had already been delivered to his Bionic Eye.

The Vocational College, reduced to ruins by the Soul Transformation cultivators' negotiations, was repeatedly shown to him in news reports.

Every piece of information seemed to carry a silent warning.

Faced with all of this, a sudden and overwhelming sense of loneliness washed over Zhang Yu.

This time, no one could make the choice for him.

This time, he had to make a decision alone — a decision that would impact his entire life, the lives of his companions, and the destinies of billions.

This feeling of isolation, this crushing pressure, felt like chains binding his body, tightening until he could barely breathe.

Just then, Yu Xinghan appeared beside him, asking, "Have you decided? You seem very uneasy."

"Oh? Is it that obvious?" Zhang Yu smiled faintly. "After all, we're facing Soul Transformation cultivators and the pressure from the sect."

Closing his eyes, Zhang Yu said slowly, "To be honest... I'm scared. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. Yet this choice, whether right or wrong, will irrevocably change me, change you, and alter the fates of countless others..."

Yu Xinghan replied, "It'll be alright, Zhang Yu. We trust you. Whatever you choose, we'll always believe in you."

At that moment, Yu Xinghan's mind flashed back to the image of Zhang Yu leading them in a fierce battle against the Demonic Sect's Golden Core cultivators, and to the moment when he had transformed himself into a believer of the Evil God to resist the Dual Rest Virus.

Unconsciously, they had long since become accomplices in crime, partners in murder, and fellow believers of the Evil God.

Yu Xinghan said earnestly, "Teacher Starfire once said that the path of the Immortal Dao is one of relentless forward progress. Problems encountered along the way can only be solved by continuing to advance. Constant cultivation, ceaseless progress — this is the destiny of every cultivator."

Zhang Yu frowned, replying slowly, "But this time, even the slightest misstep could doom the Soul Transformation cultivators..."

Yu Xinghan: "If we fail, we'll just start over. If we incur debts, we'll work hard to repay them. And if our souls are scattered and spirits extinguished, we'll accept the consequences of our gamble. Isn't that what cultivation is all about? We've been prepared for this since the day we embarked on the Immortal Dao."

"Zhang Yu, I'm willing to follow you wherever you lead. This is my choice, Yu Xinghan's choice, and I'll bear the final responsibility for its success or failure."

Crack...

Zhang Yu looked at Yu Xinghan before him and suddenly felt he wasn't alone. Several of the chains binding him seemed to snap at once.

Perhaps he couldn't confide his deepest secrets, perhaps he couldn't communicate without reservation, but at that moment, he could clearly feel Yu Xinghan's unwavering support.

Just then, Le Mulan approached them. "Zhang Yu, everyone wants to take a group photo."

Moments later, Spirit Realm Projections of Ying Xin, Shi Huaiyu, Xiao Qingxuan, and Shi Yunxiang descended, joining Zhang Yu, Yu Xinghan, and Le Mulan.

Surrounded by his friends, Zhang Yu felt more chains shattering around him.

After the photo, Shi Huaiyu asked, "Zhang Yu, have you decided on a cultivation art? Are you going for the Dharma Realm? It's okay if you don't want to say, I just want to know if the Myriad Laws coin price will keep rising."

Xiao Qingxuan interjected, "Don't ask, Huaiyu."

Shi Huaiyu persisted, "I just want to know, to make a little more..."

Zhang Yu suddenly said, "To be honest, I have no idea if the coin price will rise."

Shi Huaiyu glanced at Zhang Yu in surprise, then said awkwardly, "Sorry, Zhang Yu, I thought you'd know more..."

Zhang Yu looked at the group and sighed. "This time, I don't know where my choices will lead. I can't guarantee whether the future will be good or bad."

"So, everyone should refrain from investing for now and prepare to face whatever comes."

The group immediately felt a sense of heaviness at these words.

Amidst this solemn mood, Yu Xinghan smiled and said, "Zhang Yu, no matter what, I believe you'll succeed."

Shi Huaiyu gazed at Zhang Yu, recalling their joint campaign against the Demonic Sect's Golden Core cultivator, his repeated victories over opponents, and his ultimate ascent to the throne of the Ten Greats League.

Shi Huaiyu spoke up, "Zhang Yu, didn't you say we'd live and die together, prosper and fail together? I've invested in many stocks in my life, some profitable, some not, but overall I've made a profit, proving my judgment is sound."

"And the best stock I've ever picked... that's still you. Even now, I trust my instincts."

Xiao Qingxuan said calmly, "Even Immortals in the heavens struggle to fully grasp Kunxu's trajectory, let alone us. Zhang Yu, it would be perfectly normal if you made the wrong choice this time. But I believe in your potential. Even if you stumble this time, you'll undoubtedly succeed again in the future."

Ying Xin chuckled. "President Zhang, my family has been in civil engineering for six generations. I don't really understand Immortal Sect Techniques or anything like that."

"But, you know... 'ashes to ashes, dust to dust, soul scattered and spirit extinguished' was always our family's fate. No matter how chaotic things get from here on out, it can't possibly be worse than that, right? Since I've come to cultivate immortality, I'm not afraid of anything."

Le Mulan thought about the longevity-extending effects of her Magic Power and recalled Heavenly Demon University's research into longevity through cultivation.

Truth be told, ever since Kuang Tianqing began promoting the longevity technology of Immortal Sect Techniques, and since news reports had been constantly highlighting the conflicts between various schools over these techniques, a thought had been nagging at Le Mulan's mind.

Would Zhang Yu reveal the secret that his Profound Cold Magic Power could extend lifespan?

Le Mulan kept telling herself she trusted Zhang Yu wouldn't.

But as social discussions grew increasingly heated and friction between the Four Heavenly Demon Schools and the Four Myriad Laws Schools intensified, the thought kept resurfacing in her mind.

By now, Le Mulan understood that Zhang Yu had never revealed her secret.

Le Mulan said, "Zhang Yu, you're the most trustworthy person I've ever met since birth. Even if you go bankrupt, I'll still trust you. I'll lend you all my Spirit Coins."

Shi Yunxiang said, "Actually... I've been considering getting a transformation surgery to change my appearance into a human's, like yours, Zhang Yu..."

"No need, no need!" Zhang Yu waved his hands frantically.

At that moment, a series of crisp, cracking sounds echoed around him, shattering most of the chains that bound him.

On the other side of the Flying Boat, True Person Starfire smiled and sighed, "Ah, Zhang Yu... if only you had been born 500 years earlier."

The next moment, he sent Zhang Yu a message: Make the decision you believe is right.

True Person Starfire: As for the future, it's no longer something you alone can decide.

True Person Starfire: The future of Kunxu will be chosen by all its people.

True Person Starfire: All we can do is strive to fulfill our duty and leave the rest to fate.

At the same time, in these final moments before the award ceremony, Director Gao sent Zhang Yu a message.

Director Gao: Zhang Yu, are you not planning to choose the Dharma Realm?

Reading this message, Zhang Yu's heart skipped a beat. He thought to himself, "Have these Soul Transformation cultivators... sensed my intentions?"

Zhang Yu knew the Dharma Realm could potentially yield the greatest profits, but he also understood that the technology was far beyond his grasp, exceeding his control. The risks were too high for both him and the lower strata of Kunxu, which was why he refused to choose it.

More importantly, selecting the Dharma Realm might hinder his future entry into a sect, potentially trapping him in the lower realms for an indefinite period.

As for the options offered by other universities, Zhang Yu had no intention of choosing any of them. His companions and Teacher Starfire remained at Myriad Laws University.

He had already made up his mind.

A moment later, Director Gao sent another message: It's good you didn't choose it.

Director Gao: Keep moving forward. Don't look back.

Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution, observing Director Gao's message, raised an eyebrow slightly. "Gao Chongguang... is also an ungrateful dog."

Meanwhile, Bai Zhenzhen sent Zhang Yu a message.

Bai Zhenzhen: Yu Zi, even without any Immortal Sect sword techniques, I'll eventually perfect the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao through my own unparalleled talent.

Bai Zhenzhen: This is my confidence, and it's my path on the Immortal Dao.

Bai Zhenzhen: I don't need you to choose the Crimson Heart Sword Manual for me.

Bai Zhenzhen: Just choose the cultivation art you want.

*Snap...*

Reading Bai Zhenzhen's message, Zhang Yu took a deep breath. He felt the final chain binding him shatter completely, and the last trace of hesitation vanished from his heart.

An unprecedented resolve now burned in Zhang Yu's eyes.

With just ten minutes remaining until the award ceremony, Zhang Pianpian also sent Zhang Yu a message.

Zhang Pianpian: Nine Heavens Imperial Steps: Five swift and decisive moves, offering unparalleled speed. This Immortal Sect Technique uses spatial compression for instantaneous displacement...

Zhang Pianpian: Kunlun in the Palm: Three moves. While not as rapid as Nine Heavens Imperial Steps, it covers a much wider area. This Immortal Sect Technique also compresses space...

After reviewing the Immortal Sect Technique information sent by Zhang Pianpian, Zhang Yu couldn't help but marvel at his elder sister's extraordinary abilities. Her control over intelligence far surpassed his own.

After carefully examining the descriptions of both cultivation arts, Zhang Yu quickly made his decision.

Although the Nine Heavens Imperial Steps had two more techniques than Kunlun in the Palm, its activation speed was much faster. Zhang Yu sensed that mastering it would likely be quicker than Kunlun in the Palm.

In particular, this footwork compressed space to shorten distances, allowing for ultra-high-speed movement — a first-rate life-saving technique.

"But as expected..."

Zhang Yu's gaze shifted to the description of Kunlun in the Palm, and he thought to himself, "Kunlun in the Palm can compress space to magnify or shrink people and objects. The Immortal Dao Technology contained within this art is the key to driving the new infrastructure era and generating substantial profits."

"Moreover..."

Zhang Yu glanced at the Chain Formation Diagram information that had appeared beside him. "This Kunlun in the Palm technique is also one of the cultivation arts required for the Inverted Kunlun formation within the Chain Formation Diagram."

"Choosing Kunlun in the Palm will complete the eighth cultivation art of the Inverted Kunlun series, unlocking the Second Layer effects of the Chain Method Diagram Set."

At the same time, several staff members approached Zhang Yu, gently urging him, "Student Yu, it's time to enter the venue."

Entrance, photos, interviews... Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Zhang Yu entered the award ceremony hall.

The entire venue had been hastily constructed by the Righteous Gods over the past day, yet it still radiated a golden splendor, resembling a celestial palace.

The front row was naturally occupied by the divine lights representing the Soul Transformation stage cultivators, each radiating boundless majesty and inspiring awe, symbols of limitless wealth and power.

A single word from them could bankrupt countless students, a mere gesture could determine the rise and fall of entire industries.

The thought of having to make his choice under the gaze of these Soul Transformation cultivators sent waves of pressure washing over Zhang Yu.

As he took his seat, Zhang Yu noticed that he was surrounded by fellow contestants like Kuang Tianqing and Tian Shengong.

Bai Zhenzhen, still recovering from her injuries, was absent from the ceremony.

Sensing Zhang Yu's gaze, Kuang Tianqing turned and smiled at him.

Looking at her smile, Zhang Yu couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Zhang Yu then spotted Director Gao, True Person Starfire, Zhang Pianpian, Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan, and others in the distance, all nodding and gesturing greetings.

At that moment, a host stepped onto the stage and began reciting promotional lines before officially opening the ceremony.

"...This is not merely an awards ceremony, but a coronation of dreams, a celebration of relentless effort. Now, I am honored to announce that the grand awards ceremony for the Ten Greats League officially begins!"

Of course, Zhang Yu wasn't the only winner. Based on the final scores, the top ten competitors would each take the stage to receive their awards in order. If a winner like Bai Zhenzhen couldn't attend, a representative would accept the award on their behalf.

However, neither the elite students from various schools present nor the viewers watching the live broadcast seemed particularly interested in the other top ten competitors.

All eyes were focused on Zhang Yu.

As each of the top ten competitors received their awards, the atmosphere in the venue grew increasingly tense and solemn.

In Zhang Yu's vision, the countdown on his Divine Protection Talisman was nearing its end, with only five minutes remaining.

"The champion of this year's Ten Greats League is Zhang Yu!"

As the announcer called out Zhang Yu's name, countless spotlights instantly converged on him.

Simultaneously, with the final rankings confirmed, Zhang Yu's ranking on the leaderboard skyrocketed, leaping from his previous position to first place overall. Under the gaze of countless spectators, he had become the undisputed champion of Myriad Laws University.

On the other side of the stage, the Great God of Sentient Creation descended, appearing as Zhang Yu's award presenter.

Watching Zhang Yu walk toward the podium, Director Gao recorded the scene while sighing, "Excellent."

True Person Starfire's lips curved into a faint smile. "Who said I couldn't teach disciples properly?"

Zhang Pianpian's expression remained impassive, but a hint of warmth flickered in her usually icy gaze.

Yu Xinghan and Le Mulan stood up to applaud, continuously capturing the moment with their devices.

Bai Zhenzhen, having materialized as a Spirit Realm Projection, watched the scene with visible excitement. "Yu Zi..."

The Great God of Sentient Creation handed Zhang Yu the championship trophy, smiling slightly. "Congratulations. The future of Kunxu rests on your shoulders."

Zhang Yu respectfully accepted the trophy. In an instant, countless advertisements erupted around him like a celestial shower of flowers and golden lotuses rising from the earth, filling every livestream channel screen.

Simultaneously, a pillar of light descended from the sky. The host exclaimed excitedly, "Everyone, look! The Dao Repository Catalog has arrived!"

The Spirit Realm Projection of the Great God of Sentient Creation rose to greet the Dao Repository, preparing to receive this supreme treasure from the upper realms.

As the Great God of Sentient Creation cast a series of talismans, the Dao Repository slowly unfolded before him.

At that moment, all eyes focused on the Dao Repository Catalog, watching the Great God of Sentient Creation open it.

Zhang Yu also looked up, his heart pounding with anticipation.

Just then, a voice whispered in his ear.

"Zhang Yu, I need to talk to you."

Zhang Yu turned to see the host speaking. He frowned slightly, puzzled. "What is it?"

The host didn't reply verbally, but a familiar gray avatar appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye — Dao Qiankun's friend icon.

Dao Qiankun: I am an Immortal from the upper realms.

Dao Qiankun: I once believed that transforming into a demon and using the Demonic Dao was the right choice, but the me who made that decision... regrets it.

Zhang Yu froze, staring at the message he had just received.

Dao Qiankun: I secretly used the resources of Myriad Laws University to create the Dual Rest Cult, Unemployed Sect, and Reincarnation Cult, and began to adjust Kunxu...

Below the stage, Yu Xinghan gazed at the Dao Repository Catalog, sighing inwardly. "Does this contain all the Immortal Dao Technology? If I could just get a glimpse... I wonder how much it would cost?"

Beside him, Le Mulan glanced at Zhang Yu, her brow furrowed in confusion. "Is Zhang Yu talking to the host?"

At the same moment, Zhang Yu opened his mouth, then closed it, finally sending a message through his Bionic Eye: "Who are you really?"

Dao Qiankun: My original goal was to gradually change Kunxu.

Dao Qiankun: But no one was willing to cooperate. Despite already possessing everything, neither my disciples, my Dao Companion, nor my comrades were willing to change.

Dao Qiankun: You must understand by now that the key to changing the world lies not only in technology but also in people.

Dao Qiankun: As long as the top echelons remain filled with profit-driven individuals, no matter what technology or systems are implemented, those below will only exploit them further. The entire Kunxu will continue its relentless pursuit of profit growth, hurtling forward without restraint.

Dao Qiankun: To change Kunxu, we must break free from the interference of those above.

Dao Qiankun: As long as those people remain in power, those below will forever be puppets manipulated by them.

Zhang Yu stared blankly at the screen, unsure how to respond. "What exactly do you want?" he finally asked.

Dao Qiankun: I want to break free from those above and create a new world, a new Kunxu.

Zhang Yu took a deep breath and cautiously replied, "Who are you really? Are you using Brother Dao's account to chat with me?"

Dao Qiankun: Zhang Yu, you remember my desire to change the world. You also resisted the pressure to choose the Dharma Realm, showing the potential I value.

Dao Qiankun: That's why today... I'm offering you this opportunity.

Dao Qiankun: A chance to join me in creating a new world.

As Zhang Yu read the message, his mind reeled with confusion. He had no idea what to say.

Dao Qiankun continued: If you're willing, after opening the Dao Repository Catalog, select the Six Paths of World Evolution Book.

Dao Qiankun: It contains the latest Reincarnation Technology, perfect for you to use as your investment in the New World.

Zhang Yu: I don't understand what you're talking about.

Zhang Yu: Brother Dao, whether you're really Brother Dao or not, suddenly dumping all this on me and asking me to choose some Reincarnation Technology...

Zhang Yu: But neither Soul Transformation, nor the sect, nor the Heavenly Court would ever allow me to make such a choice.

The host simply looked at him quietly, replying in a private message: You're right. It's hard to believe all this based on just a few words.

Dao Qiankun: But information about the New World is crucial. I can't risk revealing more to prove everything to you.

Dao Qiankun: I can only assure you that everything I've said is true. Whether you choose this opportunity, whether you become my ally, that's for you to decide.

Dao Qiankun: I'm willing to trust you. After all, you already possess the power of my bloodline, don't you?

Zhang Yu's heart jolted. He remembered the Dao Seed he had copied, "Immortal Descendant." "He knows? Is he really Dao Qiankun? And he knows I copied his Immortal Descendant power?"

Zhang Yu took a deep breath, about to say something more, when the Great God of Sentient Creation announced, "Student Yu, come forward. It's your turn to choose an Immortal Sect Technique."

Zhang Yu walked step by step toward the descending Dao Repository Catalog, where a dense array of cultivation art names floated before him.

Meanwhile, the countdown on the Divine Protection Talisman was nearing its end, with only thirty seconds remaining.

Zhang Yu swallowed hard, forcing down the distracting thoughts in his mind as his gaze swept across the names of the cultivation arts.

"Brother Dao..." Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Even if everything you said is true, you have your choices, and I have my own path to walk."

"If I were to act as you did, it would be sheer recklessness."

"And I... cannot afford such recklessness."

Zhang Yu's gaze swept over the crowd below: Bai Zhenzhen, Director Gao, Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan, Zhang Pianpian...

In the next moment, his eyes hardened with resolve. He had made his final choice.

As Zhang Yu's selection was finalized, the Dao Repository Catalog shot skyward and vanished into the heavens.

But then, a thunderous roar split the sky as if an invisible hand had torn it asunder.

Boom!

Zhang Yu looked up to see a vision of another world suddenly materialize in the sky.

"That's..."

Someone in the crowd gasped, "That's the third layer!"

Immediately afterward, the sky tore open again and again, revealing the fourth, fifth, sixth layers... world after world unfolded before the eyes of countless onlookers.
