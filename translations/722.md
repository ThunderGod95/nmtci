# Chapter 722: Wealth Pierces the Firmament!

Watching the colossal red envelopes soar into the sky, staring at her plummeting asset numbers, Lady Fortune felt an excruciating heartache, an unbearable anguish.

She couldn't help but scream in Zhang Yu's mind, "Zhang Yu! Stop throwing money away! Can't we really pierce the heavens ourselves?!"

Zhang Yu knew Lady Fortune wasn't ignorant of the answer. She had been by his side through every attempt, watching him try to break through the firmament alone after it was sealed, and witnessing him meticulously design every step of the Heaven-Piercing Plan.

At this moment, Lady Fortune was simply too tormented, too distressed, to stop herself from questioning him again.

Zhang Yu understood her feelings; even he felt his own spirit tremble as he watched his assets burn away at a frantic pace.

In response to her question, as if answering both her and himself, he replied calmly, "Lady Fortune, have you forgotten? We tried the moment the firmament was sealed again... It's impossible."

"The difficulty of forcefully piercing the firmament has increased. Even if we managed to break through, it would just repair itself. My body can't withstand the firmament's backlash for long, and we'd attract unwanted attention..."

Zhang Yu recalled that secret attempt. He had felt a terrifying aura lock onto him from the firmament above. Now, he suspected it had been Fu Xiantian.

"Relying on myself, how many people and resources could I bring up? It wouldn't change the course of the war."

Lady Fortune sobbed, "Do we really need so many people? Aren't the Myriad Laws' own forces enough? Aren't the Ten Universities enough?"

"It's not enough, Lady Fortune..." Zhang Yu said softly. "Didn't we already calculate this? We need to shatter the entire firmament."

"With all the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs absent, even if we mobilized every teacher, student, Soul Cultivator, artifact spirit, and staff member from the Ten Universities to operate the Great Void Cloud Repository at its maximum capacity, we still wouldn't reach the numbers needed to break through the firmament."

"And we only have one chance. The Righteous Qi Alliance won't give us a second."

"So... we must unleash all our power in a saturation attack."

As Zhang Yu and Lady Fortune conversed in his mind, his announcement about the Great Void Red Envelopes had already spread across the heavens and earth through the Spirit Realm.

---

Beneath the firmament of Kunxu's Third Layer.

Although Ye Xingli had mentally prepared herself before Zhang Yu's speech, truly hearing his words and seeing the astronomical wealth soaring toward the sky still left her utterly shocked.

"He must have thrown in all the Soul Transformation Hidden Legacies deciphered by the other universities too, right?"

"Junior Brother..." Ye Xingli's heart trembled, and an unprecedented feeling surfaced within her. "To rescue Master, you'd actually go this far?"

"Is this the bond between master and disciple described in ancient texts?"

"No, even in ancient times, how many could have gone to such lengths?"

Ye Xingli knew that if it were her, she would never have been able to burn through assets like this.

"Master wasn't wrong about Zhang Yu. He truly is someone who values old ties and cherishes relationships..."

A strange feeling welled up in Ye Xingli's heart.

Moved? Envious? Longing?

She didn't know. She only knew that in this moment, an impulse surged within her as well.

Ye Xingli shot into the sky, activating the Great Void Cloud Repository's Heaven-Piercing Cone function and ramming directly into the firmament.

With the impact, the Great Void Cloud Repository became firmly embedded in the firmament's Spatial Barrier, like a nail hammered into a wall.

Simultaneously, a red envelope was directly injected into Ye Xingli's body. She watched as the Spirit Coin balance in her account increased.

After broadcasting this entire process live, Ye Xingli announced, "Everyone, I got the red envelope!"

"What True Monarch Blazing Light said is true! Just by participating in the Heaven-Piercing Operation and embedding your Great Void Cloud Repository into the firmament, you can immediately receive a red envelope. The minimum is 0.1 Spirit Coins, and the maximum is 100 Spirit Coins!"

"This isn't a loan or a credit line — it's real, actual Spirit Coins!"

"Hurry up and grab your red envelopes!"

Broadcasting the process of receiving a Great Void Red Envelope was a task Zhang Yu had assigned to Ye Xingli beforehand.

As someone with tens of millions of junior college fans, Ye Xingli watched the bullet comments in her livestream gradually explode with excitement. She knew her mission was complete.

This was also the first time Ye Xingli had seen her livestream chat explode with such frenzy — all without her jumping, jiggling, or twisting; without close-ups, leg shots, or outfit changes.

Ye Xingli sighed inwardly, "Junior Brother, this is all I can do to help you."

"No... I... maybe there's one more thing I can do."

Looking at her account, Ye Xingli took a deep breath and transferred all the advertising fees Zhang Yu had paid her, along with the red envelope money she had just received, to him.

Ye Xingli: Junior Brother, your Senior Sister is useless. This is the most I can support you with.

Ye Xingli: Any more, and I'd start losing money... I really can't bring myself to do that. [Tears]

Just as Ye Xingli sent the message, a series of warnings flashed in her Bionic Eye.

[Poverty Simulator: Warning! User suspected of prolonged exposure to harmful ideologies. Mindset is beginning to pauperize. To prevent becoming rich in body but poor in spirit, and to avoid the pauperization of your Dao Heart, please cease using this product immediately...]

Ye Xingli gave a wry smile and thought, "I never imagined I'd reach a point where I'm rich in body but poor in spirit..."

But for some reason, at this moment, Ye Xingli didn't feel bad at all.

Inside Feng Tingting's livestream room.

As the sound of red envelopes arriving chimed, Feng Tingting shouted to her audience, "Did you all see that? Just activate the Great Void Cloud Repository's Anti-Gravity function and steer it to crash into the firmament!"

"I already got a red envelope! 4.8 Spirit Coins!"

"Don't worry, it's not a coupon! Not a cash voucher either — it's real Spirit Coins, deposited directly into your account!"

"Hurry up and grab them! If you're late, they might be gone!"

Watching the chat scroll frantically, Feng Tingting felt a tremor in her heart and thought, "Senior, I've completed my task. This move of yours..."

She turned her head and saw figures beginning to soar into the sky from the ground of Kunxu's Third Layer.

As she watched the red envelopes being snatched from the sky one by one, Feng Tingting could almost see Zhang Yu's assets evaporating.

For some reason, tears streamed down her face.

It wasn't her money, but seeing Spirit Coins being thrown away like this made her heart ache.

"What a waste."

"Who burns money like this?!"

---

Inside Lian Tianji's livestream room.

Having already reached the Golden Core Realm, she steered her Great Void Cloud Repository straight into the firmament, then burst into laughter for her audience. "Everyone, the red envelopes have arrived!"

"It's just like True Monarch Blazing Light said — so easy, so simple."

"You should all go try it too."

"The top three viewers in my stream who get the largest red envelopes can join me for an offline study session."

After finishing, Lian Tianji sent a message to Zhang Yu: Done.

Zhang Yu: Thanks.

Lian Tianji: I can waive the advertising fee.

Zhang Yu: ?

Lian Tianji: When the True Monarch is free, could you give me a private tutoring session?

---

Inside Zhao Tianxing's livestream room, the bullet comments were always sparse.

As a typical Soul Cultivator, Zhao Tianxing's audience was also mostly composed of Soul Cultivators. In the Spirit Realm, Soul Cultivators were known for their frugal viewing and listening habits, often refraining from commenting to save data. They usually only became active when paid in Spirit Coins for bot-farming tasks.

But at this moment, as Zhao Tianxing steered his Great Void Cloud Repository into the firmament and received a 1.8 Spirit Coin red envelope, countless Soul Cultivators erupted with excitement. The entire livestream's bullet comments exploded into a frenzy.

Yet, gazing at the flood of comments, Zhao Tianxing couldn't bring himself to feel happy.

Every excited comment likely represented another drain on Zhang Yu's assets.

The thought made Zhao Tianxing's heart ache.

"Spending so much money... won't it affect the company?"

"What if the company goes bankrupt?"

"Such a good job, such a good boss like Zhang Yu... where else could I ever find another one!?"

At the same time, with a soft "thud", Zhao Tianxing saw a Junior College Student piloting a Great Void Cloud Repository smash violently into the firmament not far from his own.

This Junior College Student was none other than Chang Buxiu.

After the factory announced that participating in the Great Void Red Envelope event wouldn't count as taking leave, affect performance reviews, or result in docked pay, Chang Buxiu had been the first to rush out.

He had unwavering faith in True Monarch Blazing Light.

He believed in the True Monarch who had given him Spirit Coins, the True Monarch who had raised his salary. He trusted that the True Monarch's red envelopes were absolutely real.

Lacking his own Great Void Cloud Repository, he had immediately opted for a Shared Great Void Cloud Repository. Without enough Spirit Coins for the deposit, he had staked everything he owned to secure it, then rammed straight into the firmament.

*Ding!*

Seeing the Spirit Coins arrive in his account, Chang Buxiu cheered, "It's here! The red envelope arrived!"

---

In addition to Ye Xingli and her group, there were Yu Xinghan, Tian Shengong, Kuang Tianqing... At Zhang Yu's urging, one after another, cultivators with significant influence in the Spirit Realm livestreamed themselves smashing into the firmament and claiming the red envelopes.

As a result, the countless students and teachers who had been hesitant and skeptical now began to boil with excitement.

On the ground of Kunxu's Third Layer, what started as a few scattered figures soaring into the sky to chase the red envelope rain and crash into the firmament...

...soon became a torrent. As news spread and the promotion intensified, more and more figures surged upward. They advanced wave after wave, crashing into the firmament like a great flood.

Perhaps for many powerful experts, the amount of money in the red envelopes wasn't particularly appealing.

But for Lower College Students, Junior College Students, and even High School Students — for these cultivators with ordinary cultivation levels who struggled every month to pay off debts and afford their next dose of medicinal pills — the red envelope rewards could represent weeks, months, or even years of savings.

They surged forward in a chaotic throng, charging straight for the firmament. Their eyes held no concern for the bigger picture, no thought of the war — only a burning desire for money and a yearning for the Great Void Red Envelopes.

As this great flood of cultivators crashed into the firmament, a massive amount of funds circulated rapidly throughout the Spirit Realm. Countless people roared with excitement.

"The red envelopes are real!"

"I got one! I got one!"

"Haha, now I can finally pay off my debts!"

"I have money for medicinal pills!"

"Haha, I can afford a Bionic Eye! I can finally see clearly!"

In the sky, cultivators' faces flushed red with excitement, their vital energy surging as if they were caught in a frenzy.

At some point, someone shouted, "Thank you, True Monarch Blazing Light!"

Another person echoed, "True Monarch Blazing Light should become a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch!"

"Soul Transformation! Soul Transformation! I support True Monarch Blazing Light for Soul Transformation!"

"True Monarch Blazing Light should be the principal!"

"True Monarch Blazing Light! Please, come be the boss of our company!"

In the Spirit Realm, lines of bullet comments flew across every livestream chat.

"[Fist] Blazing Light [Fire]"

"Divine Monarch Blazing Light!"

"Immortal Blazing Light!"

---

Meanwhile, Yu Xinghan's projection crossed the Spirit Realm and landed beside Zhang Yu.

"Isn't it enough yet?" he asked worriedly. "Right now, cultivators from all over the world are rushing to Kunxu's Third Layer, all wanting to charge the firmament. If you keep burning money like this, even Soul Transformation Assets won't be enough!"

Le Mulan: Zhang Yu, more and more people are coming. Everyone in the Spirit Realm has gone mad.

Le Mulan: If you keep burning money like this, you'll burn through all your assets.

Le Mulan: [103.456554 Spirit Coins transferred]

In the Research Association's Meditation Chamber, Bai Zhenzhen, who was in secluded cultivation, couldn't stop the tears streaming down her face.

The Qingtian Sword Spirit suddenly appeared, asking in confusion, "Why are you crying so hard? Did that Zhang Yu die?"

Bai Zhenzhen shook her head, but her sobs grew even more heartbroken.

"I gave him all my money."

"Seeing him give it all away... I'm so heartbroken, so heartbroken, wahhh!!"

Thinking of the cultivation resources she had painstakingly accumulated year after year, of the Spirit Coins left to her by Divine Monarch Seven Emotions — all of which she had thrown into supporting Zhang Yu — and how Zhang Yu, in turn, had burned it all to promote the Great Void Red Envelopes...

Thinking of her years of hard work, of the money she'd gotten by abandoning her dignity and begging her parents, Bai Zhenzhen's sobs grew even more heart-wrenching.

The Qingtian Sword Spirit sneered, "Who told you to give him the money? I told you that you chose the wrong target for your Extreme Emotion Sword Dao..."

Bai Zhenzhen said, "I believe in Yu Zi. Even if he wants to throw money away, I'll support him. But... but I don't want to be poor again, and I don't want to see Yu Zi become poor again either!"

Poverty was too terrifying. Every time she remembered the times she had nearly starved to death, a chill ran down her spine.

The Qingtian Sword Spirit pursed her lips and said, "Then just tell him to stop."

Bai Zhenzhen stared at Zhang Yu's profile picture, clenching her jaw tightly. "Right now, he must be under the most pressure. I... I must support his decision."

---

Meanwhile.

Ying Xin watched the constantly changing data, her heart pounding wildly with every jump in the numbers.

Zhang Yu's assets, the company's funds for the Great Void Red Envelopes... all were plummeting at an insane rate.

But...

"The user count is soaring, and the deposits for the Shared Cloud Repository are exploding!"

Ying Xin's eyes were glued to the data, feeling as if thousands upon thousands of people were registering as Shared Cloud Repository users every moment.

In particular, the user base of high school, junior college, and lower college students — groups previously unrelated to the Great Void Cloud Repository — was also skyrocketing.

And the deposits they were paying...

Ying Xin was shocked. "These are all deposits paid with borrowed money."

"They're using the channels provided by Shared Great Void to borrow money to pay the deposits, then renting the Great Void Cloud Repository."

Ying Xin knew that when Shared Great Void reached the payment stage, users could choose to take out a loan. The primary lending platform for this naturally belonged to Myriad Laws — the assets of Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood.

"Although True Monarch Blazing Light has been burning through money, he's acquired a massive user base. Could this also be part of the True Monarch's plan?"

Meanwhile, high-level officials from various schools and leaders from numerous companies were all observing Zhang Yu's insane operation.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter watched the torrents of data soaring into the sky, crashing against the firmament, and felt a profound shock. "Is he trying to organize tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of people to break open the firmament?"

"Even Soul Transformation Assets would be completely burned through at this rate."

"Who else but an Immortal could throw money around on this scale?"

If Zhang Yu had merely scattered a few hundred Spirit Coins to the poor, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter would have thought him wasteful.

A few thousand Spirit Coins? He would have assumed it was some commercial tactic — promotion, hype, or advertising.

If it were tens or hundreds of thousands of Spirit Coins given to the poor, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter would have wondered if the man had gone mad, if something was wrong with his mind.

But to throw money around on Zhang Yu's current scale... all he felt was utter shock.

In True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's view, to directly scatter money to hundreds of millions of poor people, to dissipate Soul Transformation Assets like this, to possess such audacity, to even conceive of using money to smash a hole in the heavens... If this wasn't an Immortal, what was?

"Immortal methods! Truly Immortal methods!"

At this moment, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter was utterly convinced of his original judgment.

"Zhang Yu is definitely the reincarnation of an Immortal!"

"Who else but a reincarnated Immortal would be willing to burn money like this? Who else could treat wealth as mere dust?"

"Only someone with an Immortal's perspective could remain so calm while burning through Soul Transformation Assets."

Just as True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter was marveling at this, True Monarch Miraculous Hand suddenly spoke up beside him. "This isn't just about throwing money away."

"He's using money to acquire users."

True Monarch Miraculous Hand continued, "According to the information I've received, the number of registered users for Shared Great Void has just surpassed one billion!"

"The number of users who have paid the deposit has already risen to eighty million."

"And these numbers are still skyrocketing!"

True Monarch Miraculous Hand gazed at the Crimson Dragon formed by Great Void Red Envelopes soaring into the sky, his voice filled with admiration. "By leveraging this Heaven-Piercing Plan, True Monarch Blazing Light has secured the collective support of the Ten Universities!"

"To support this plan, all the universities and companies have required their cultivators to participate in the Heaven-Piercing Operation. Many have even incorporated it into their performance reviews and assessments."

"That's why all the Lower College students, Junior College students — all students, really — can now easily leave their work or classes, rent a Great Void Cloud Repository, and join the Heaven-Piercing Operation. While they're grabbing red envelopes, they're also completing tasks assigned by their schools and companies."

"What is this?" True Monarch Miraculous Hand sighed in admiration. "This is forcing the Ten Universities to release their people, pushing the entire market toward him."

"This money hasn't just vanished. It's been used to forge a colossal company that will soon have billions of users and monopolize the space pouch market."

"And how could those poor cultivators afford the deposit? They'll have to borrow it through the Great Void Cloud Repository, won't they?"

"That's another stream of income right there."

True Monarch Miraculous Hand sighed again. "It may look like he's burning through money now, but he'll definitely earn it all back in the end!"

"By leveraging absolute technological superiority and massive capital, he's achieved this... truly an Immortal's move."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter's eyes flickered at these words, his heart filled with even greater awe. "As expected of a reincarnated Immortal. Not only does he possess absolute superiority in Immortal Dao Technology, but he also has the audacity to burn through Soul Transformation Assets."

"With a single move, he's squeezed the world dry, converting it all into his own Immortal Dao resources."

True Monarch Miraculous Hand said, "Perhaps... it's not entirely exploitation..."

He pondered for a moment. "True Monarch Blazing Light has secured a vast market with limitless financial prospects. As upstream and downstream businesses, we've also profited handsomely from this. The Ten Universities' channels, needless to say, have also earned a fortune producing the Great Void Cloud Repositories."

"As for the poor cultivators, they've all seized this opportunity to start using the Great Void Cloud Repository."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter was stunned. "Are you saying... everyone has profited?"

True Monarch Miraculous Hand nodded. "It seems so for now. But the ultimate outcome... rests entirely on True Monarch Blazing Light's whim."

"Once he monopolizes the market, whoever he wants to profit will profit. Whoever he wants to ruin will be utterly ruined."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter nodded. "Besides breaking open the firmament, this is likely the True Monarch's true objective. To whip the world forward with his own power... In the future, he alone... might be able to squeeze both inside and outside the Ten Universities dry."

---

Inside Heavenly Demon University.

True Monarch Precise Attainment exclaimed, "The user count is growing this fast?"

Kuang Tianqing replied, "Indeed. If this continues, over ninety percent of Lower College, Junior College, and High School students will become users of the Great Void Cloud Repository..."

Listening to the analysis, True Monarch Precise Attainment sighed, "Sweeping the world with one hand's Immortal Dao Technology, and stirring up storms with the other's capital operations... Truly the makings of a Banished Immortal... a Banished Immortal indeed."

Another cultivator spoke up, "This is burning money to capture the market. Should we follow suit? Before Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus left, she ordered us to preserve our self-developed Fire Seed..."

True Monarch Precise Attainment knew that through self-development and some imitation, the Heavenly Demon Secret Treasury could now also be updated with a Heaven-Piercing Cone function.

"Burn the money..." he said.

"Burn a little..."

"Five users piercing the heavens together can get a Red Envelope..."

"Hmm... and inside the Red Envelope, there's a chance to win cash rewards."

Kuang Tianqing thought to himself, "Hmph, with such meager ambition, how can we possibly compete with Blazing Light?"

True Monarch Precise Attainment, however, had always favored trading market share for technology over self-development. Especially since, in his view, Zhang Yu held an absolute technological advantage, making self-development even less meaningful.

His current plan for a low-cost promotional event was merely to have an excuse ready for Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's eventual return.

Beyond that, he recalled a rumor.

"The makings of a Banished Immortal... Could True Monarch Blazing Light truly be the reincarnation of an Immortal?"

The thought of this possibility extinguished any remaining desire in True Monarch Precise Attainment to contend with him.

---

On Kunxu's Third Layer, within the campus of Immortal Armaments University.

The leadership of Immortal Armaments University had also learned about the explosive growth in the Great Void Cloud Repository's user base.

Someone proposed, "Copy it!"

But another objected, "We can't out-copy them!"

So, Immortal Armaments University launched a promotion: use the Void Box: Heaven-Piercing Edition to participate in the Heaven-Piercing Plan for a chance to win cash (in ultra-fine print: vouchers).

---

As the Heaven-Piercing Operation commenced, the Righteous Qi Alliance also sprang into action.

Vast numbers of cultivators swarmed out, launching a coordinated assault from all directions in an attempt to halt the Heaven-Piercing Operation.

Watching Zhang Yu's red envelope rain, True Monarch Heaven Devourer cursed inwardly, "That madman."

But in the Dark Spirit Realm, many more watched the scene with growing eagerness.

"Sigh, if only we could grab some too."

"I wonder if the Alliance Leader would ever distribute red envelopes like this?"

"Instead of handing out so much Righteous Qi Value, he might as well just give us Spirit Coins."

The Righteous Qi Value that the Righteous Qi Alliance had been distributing so frequently these past days now seemed utterly lackluster compared to the Spirit Coin red envelopes.

Seeing the morale within the Righteous Qi Alliance plummet and even the efficiency of various production lines decline, the Evil Gods had no choice but to frantically censor videos, block news, and suppress any information about Zhang Yu's extravagant spending.

True Monarch Junior College watched this unfold, his heart aching. "So much money... How could he just throw it all at junior college students?"

True Monarch Immortal Slayer repeatedly commanded assaults, only to be repelled by the well-prepared Ten Universities. Amidst the fiery chaos of battle, they remained unable to shake the Heaven-Piercing Operation.

Gazing at the torrent of red envelopes on the live broadcast, he thought grimly, "Throwing money... To think he'd resort to such a tactic."

"This is Kunxu. For these lower college students, junior college students, and high school students, no amount of reason, ideals, future, or the bigger picture can compare to the money right in front of them."

"This is the world and its people. So-called morality and ideals ultimately pale in comparison to tangible benefits."

"And this is precisely what Master and Grandmaster seek to change."

At the same time, a question arose in his mind: "The Ten Universities... they seemed to know our attack plan in advance."

"Was there a spy in that meeting?"

Just then, under the relentless assault of the red envelope torrents, faint cracks began to appear in the firmament of Kunxu's Third Layer.

The cracks were constantly being repaired, yet they continued to spread, gradually forming a spiderweb-like pattern across the entire sky.

"It's about to break!"

In the Dark Spirit Realm, the Auspicious God sighed, "I told you so. I told you we needed to deal with Zhang Yu, but you wouldn't listen."

"Now look at the mess he's made!"

The Joy God couldn't help retorting, "Enough. You didn't know he could cause this much trouble either."

The Herald God remained silent, his gaze fixed on the Evil God Register.

Now that the Evil God Register had grown stronger again, it could faintly sense the auras of Evil Gods.

And within its perception, another familiar aura flickered in and out of existence near the Grand Void of Kunxu's Third Layer.

"An Evil God is hiding on the Ten Universities campus? How did I not know about this?"

---

Crack!

With a deafening crack, a corner of the Third Layer's firmament shattered.

Fu Xiantian's projection had already appeared beside Zhang Yu, its arrival unnoticed.

This time, he was once again using a cultivator's account to speak with Zhang Yu.

Gazing at the increasingly fractured firmament, Fu Xiantian said coolly, "Are you willing to burn through all your assets just to stop me?"

"Zhang Yu, is it really worth going this far?"

Zhang Yu looked at the gradually widening hole in the sky and replied calmly, "Whether it's worth it or not, I no longer care to distinguish. I only want to do what I want to do and save the people I want to save."

Fu Xiantian retorted coldly, "Save your Master? Your classmates? Your fellow villagers? Save this world and its people? What if they are all wrong? What if you're saving the wrong ones?"

Zhang Yu: "Then I'll be wrong with them!"

The next moment, with a thunderous roar, the entire firmament shattered completely, revealing the Fourth Layer of Kunxu to countless onlookers.

Billions of howling God-Demon Children swept across the land, their power capable of destroying heaven and earth.

The Netherworld Blood River stretched across the sky, radiating a terrifying aura.

All manner of uncontrolled natural disasters ravaged every corner of the Fourth Layer.

The people who had just shattered the firmament were now confronted with the sight of this forbidden zone of life.

Immediately after, Zhang Yu pointed toward the sky. A rain of red envelopes, representing a massive amount of funds, surged upward, crashing against the firmament that blocked the path to Kunxu's Fifth Layer.

Wherever Zhang Yu's fingertip passed, vast sums of money swept through, clearing away fines and penalties. The chaotic weather seemed to be smoothed out by his hand alone.

At the same time, countless powerful cultivators from the Ten Great Universities soared toward the Fourth Layer's firmament.

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter moved with divine speed, thinking, "If Zhang Yu is a reincarnated Immortal, who can possibly stop him?"

True Monarch String Tone, while casting daoist arts, thought, "This battle isn't just for profit. It's to protect our assets from being seized by the Righteous Qi Alliance."

True Monarch Precise Attainment mused, "With just a flick of Zhang Yu's little hand now, future manufacturing contracts, sales agreements, distribution channels... that's countless Spirit Coins..."

In that moment, the Nascent Soul True Monarchs acted for various reasons: some for the future projects Zhang Yu had promised, some for the manufacturing contracts with the Great Void Cloud Repository, some simply for the funds Zhang Yu provided, some because they believed he was a reincarnated Immortal, and others to defeat the Righteous Qi Alliance, protect their own assets, and triumph over their rivals.

In this moment, Nascent Soul experts, following Zhang Yu's plan, voluntarily moved to block the out-of-control powers of the Soul Transformation cultivators.

Although these were Soul Transformation-level powers, they had been rampaging for so long that they were now greatly depleted, enough for the combined might of the Nascent Soul True Monarchs from the various universities to block them.

At the same time, Zhang Yu's voice thundered across the sky, appearing in everyone's bionic eyes.

"Everyone, the second round of red envelopes has begun!"

"Money in hand, follow me!"

"With me, we will shatter the Fifth Layer Firmament as well!"

"Before us lies a sky full of Spirit Coins!"

*BOOM!*

In that instant, a surging torrent of people soared into the sky.

As Zhang Yu's fingertip swept across the heavens, the fierce winds ceased, the torrential rain subsided, and earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons — all manner of natural disasters — were directly smoothed over by Spirit Coins.

Wherever Zhang Yu's fingertip passed, countless Nascent Soul cultivators were mobilized, carving out a safe passage for the massive wave of cultivators behind them.

As Zhang Yu's fingertip continued to point inch by inch toward the firmament, the great flood of hundreds of millions of cultivators surged upward.

One by one, the Great Void Cloud Repositories activated, forming dense spatial barriers that warped the light, resembling countless stars converging into a single point.

Another red envelope secured! Chang Buxiu roared with excitement, his admiration for True Monarch Blazing Light reaching its peak.

The characters above his head changed to display: [Fist] Blazing Light [Fire]

Chang Buxiu wasn't alone. More and more cultivators began displaying similar characters above their heads. Accompanied by the distorted radiance of the Great Void Cloud Repositories, they resembled sparks of fire hurtling toward the firmament.

The Fifth Layer Firmament soon showed faint cracks, which widened and shattered under the relentless assault.

Watching this scene, Lady Fortune gradually stopped crying and murmured, "With a single finger, he moves all living beings; with a single thought, he shatters heaven and earth."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter gazed at the gradually emerging Fifth Layer of Kunxu, sighing with emotion, "A hundred million coins to break the Myriad Laws... truly the work of an Immortal."

True Monarch Immortal Slayer watched with eyes burning with rage. "That bastard! He's ruined our grand plan!"

In this moment, Zhang Yu's will became the will of all living beings. Wherever he pointed, even the sky would be torn asunder, and the earth itself would be pulverized!

*BOOM!*

The final layer of the firmament shattered. The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Layers of Kunxu were completely breached and connected
