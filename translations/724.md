# Chapter 724: Kneel

"He actually burned through this much money?"

As he stared at the company's accounts, at the massive figures, at the endless stream of transactions transferring funds into the accounts of countless high school, vocational college, and lower college students, Divine Monarch Greenwood couldn't help but feel his heart tremble.

Distributing such an immense fortune to the poor... let alone the Kunxu of today, even in ancient Kunxu, Greenwood had never seen anyone with such audacity.

"Zhang Yu... what an astonishing move." Divine Monarch Greenwood shook his head, a bitter smile forming on his lips. For a moment, he didn't know whether to admire Zhang Yu's boldness or resent him for it.

"The fortune your Master and I spent so long accumulating... to think more than half of it would be burned away just like that."

He could only console himself inwardly: "At least breaking the firmament can turn the tide of the war. As for the money... we can always earn it back later."

Yet, despite his repeated self-reassurance, a sharp pang of pain continued to spread through his heart.

Just then, Divine Monarch Greenwood heard Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole beside him grind her teeth and hiss, "That wretched disciple... that wretched disciple!"

Divine Monarch Greenwood knew Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole was speaking in anger, but he could still feel the intensity of her fury.

He quickly tried to soothe her, "Don't dwell on it, Magnetic Pole. The war is our priority now. Zhang Yu probably saw how critical the situation was and resorted to this desperate measure, spending so much money to save us."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's Magic Power surged within her, her Primordial Spirit trembling with agitation. "But he spent far too much! Those Spirit Coins were enough to push us both to the Peak Soul Transformation realm, bring him to Peak Soul Transformation as well, and still have enough left to invest in the Ten Universities, letting the money generate more money..."

"And he just burned through more than half of it like that?"

"If he'd used it for cultivation, for forging magical artifacts, for dual cultivation, for starting a business... I could have accepted any of that."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole seethed, "But he just gave all that money away to the poor?!"

Divine Monarch Greenwood sighed softly. "At least he used it to promote the Great Void Cloud Repository. The Spirit Coins weren't completely wasted. They're just accompanying you in a different form now."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole snorted coldly and said nothing.

But as more and more data and accounts appeared before her, a divine light flickered in her eyes. Suddenly, she said, "Old Gao, you're right."

As she continued to examine the Great Void Cloud Repository's deposit income and the loan platform's accounts, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's eyes grew brighter and brighter. "These Spirit Coins really are accompanying me in a different form."

Just then, the consciousnesses of the Divine Monarchs in the Sailing Together Group collided simultaneously.

Their projections in the Spirit Realm erupted in furious roars, mournful wails, and bitter curses.

Divine Monarch Nether Spring of Netherworld University, Wang Yin's mother, was incandescent with rage.

She sneered coldly, "Excellent, just excellent! To think that while we fight and die to protect the world, with the bodies of our fallen Divine Monarchs not even cold — their remains not even sold off yet — our inheritance is already being carved up below! Is this how things should be?"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus raged, "The university's money! Zhang Yu took over 30%, and they took over 60%! Leaving me with less than 10%? And I'm supposed to thank them for shattering the firmament?! This is utterly outrageous!"

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets of Immortal Armaments University had also been feeling a sharp pang of grief, but seeing that Magnetic Pole and Greenwood had lost most of their fortunes made him feel considerably better.

But he was, after all, a Soul Transformation Cultivator with unparalleled intelligence gathering and data retrieval capabilities. He quickly sensed that something was amiss.

"This isn't ordinary money burning. That brat, Blazing Light..." The more Thousand Puppets examined the data, the more alarmed he became. "He's using a colossal amount of funds, seizing the opportunity of this war to burn his way into creating a market with infinite potential, laying a solid foundation to monopolize the space pouch market in the future."

"Especially that Shared Cloud Repository move — deposits turning into red envelopes, which then become deposits again. He's making one coin do the work of ten, pushing money burning to its absolute limit. And as he burns... the money transforms into deposits and loan debts, flowing right back into his company's accounts."

A flicker of admiration rose in Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets' heart at this realization, but it quickly turned to resentment and fury. After all, part of the money Zhang Yu had burned belonged to Immortal Armaments University — it was from the Soul Transformation inheritance.

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets declared, "Zhang Yu burned our universities' Soul Transformation inheritance! Unacceptable! He must compensate us. Besides, if we hadn't been here seeking support, how could he have found the justification to launch this Heaven-Piercing Operation? Where would he have gotten the opportunity to shower so many people with money?"

"We proposed the need, launched the Soul Transformation War, and fought until now. We are the greatest contributors."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander agreed, "Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets is right. Without our military backing, without us persisting in the fight until this point, this matter would never have succeeded. Besides, Zhang Yu also took the inheritance that rightfully belonged to us..."

Listening to Thousand Puppets and Blade Commander's accusations, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole almost laughed out of sheer anger.

She spoke in the group chat, "This has nothing to do with Zhang Yu. Greenwood and I authorized him to do it. If you have something to say, say it directly to us."

Divine Monarch Greenwood was momentarily stunned. "Me?"

But the next moment, as the gazes of the other Divine Monarchs fell upon him, his expression hardened. He declared coldly, "That's right. I previously authorized Zhang Yu to take the Soul Transformation inheritance. And I approved of him burning that money. If you have a problem, direct it at me. If you want to fight or kill, I, Greenwood, will face you to the end. But do not involve my student."

Seeing Greenwood stand so proud and defiant, Divine Monarch Nether Spring's heart stirred. She thought to herself, "Greenwood? A guy from the Civil Engineering Department... he actually has such spirit?"

Beside them, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole continued, "I, Magnetic Pole, am not one to hoard benefits. The market for Spatial Technology is vast, and space pouches are not the only profitable venture. Future upstream and downstream industries will require everyone's cooperation..."

Amidst a rapid exchange of information, the distribution of future market profits was settled among the dozens of Soul Transformation experts.

In an instant, the Divine Monarchs were temporarily placated by Magnetic Pole and Greenwood, refocusing their attention on the ongoing Soul Transformation War.

During their brief, high-speed communication, the Righteous Qi Alliance's Soul Transformation offensive grew fiercer and more frantic, as if they were racing against time to eliminate another Soul Transformation expert from the Ten Universities.

Faced with this situation, the Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts naturally refused to sit back and await their doom. They quickly covered for one another, clashing fiercely with the Righteous Qi Alliance's Soul Transformation Cultivators.

---

Meanwhile.

On the Kunxu Fifth Layer, amidst countless people from High Schools, Vocational Colleges, and Lower Colleges, an ordinary-looking old man gazed up at the sky, his eyes fixed on the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation that stretched across the horizon.

This old man was none other than True Person Starfire, who had long since broken through to the Nascent Soul Realm. Or rather, he should now be called True Monarch Starfire.

At this moment, he blended into the crowd, having rushed up while continuously circulating the Great Void Cloud Repository.

His gaze swept over the dense clusters of "flames" surrounding him, and he couldn't help but sigh inwardly. "What a grand spectacle. To think that a student from Songyang High School has now become a pivotal figure in the Ten Universities, someone who will decide the future of Kunxu's Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Layers."

"However..."

His gaze returned to the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation, his expression turning incredibly grave. "This Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation seems strange. It's different from the one I saw in the sect."

As True Monarch Starfire scrutinized it, he thought, "Something's wrong... very wrong..."

After a moment's thought, his figure flickered and seemed to merge with the wind. Without attracting anyone's attention, he shot toward the great formation like a bolt of lightning.

Meanwhile, within the Bionic Eyes of countless people on the scene, Spirit Realm information flickered continuously. Data gathered from every perspective converged and was transmitted to the distant depths of the Spirit Realm.

In those depths, Zhang Pianpian's consciousness seemed to have coalesced into a Righteous God State. Gazing at the battlefield, she sighed. "I never expected that while I was using the unsupervised divine power network to forge my Divine Body, my younger brother would turn the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Layers upside down."

"But if the connection to Upper Kunxu is restored, how will they deal with him? I fear both the Heavenly Court and the sects will target him then."

As Zhang Pianpian pondered, she sensed a subtle disturbance deep within the Spirit Realm — a reaction triggered by some kind of summons, a call that resonated through the realm.

And this summons, this call, was all too familiar to her.

"The Heavenly Court... is about to descend. Has it really come this early?"

Zhang Pianpian understood there was only one explanation for this.

"One of the Great Gods from the Eight Divisions is personally overseeing this operation and has been granted permission to descend in their true form."

"They... are already on their way."

At this thought, her heart couldn't help but clench.

---

Meanwhile, in the Meditation Chamber of the Research Association.

Bai Zhenzhen watched the firmament shatter on the live broadcast, breathed a small sigh of relief, then closed the stream and returned to her cultivation.

The Qingtian Sword Spirit spoke, "Not watching anymore? Weren't you always so concerned?"

Bai Zhenzhen replied gravely, "What good would watching do? The battlefield above is no longer something I can participate in at my current level."

"If I want to help, I need to become stronger."

Feeling the modulated Nascent Soul currently dormant on her Golden Core, Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, "I must break through to the Nascent Soul Realm as soon as possible..."

Seeing Bai Zhenzhen cultivating so earnestly, the Qingtian Sword Spirit remained silent. It merely gazed silently toward the sky, toward the battlefield beyond the layers of the firmament, its thoughts unreadable.

---

In the Dark Spirit Realm.

The Soul Transformation Cultivators of the Righteous Qi Alliance, especially those from the Finance Department, were wailing in despair.

As Zhang Yu's Great Void Red Envelopes spread and the firmament shattered, morale within the Righteous Qi Alliance plummeted. Many Junior College and Lower College students who had previously defected to the Alliance were now tempted to snatch the red envelopes for themselves.

Many of these Junior College students had originally "run" to the Righteous Qi Alliance seeking a better life. They used to look down on their peers who remained in the Ten Universities, feeling a sense of superiority.

But now, seeing those same peers receive direct cash payouts, the Junior College students in the Righteous Qi Alliance felt their superiority vanish instantly. The Alliance's various benefits suddenly seemed far less appealing.

It could be said that Zhang Yu's single maneuver had drastically altered the morale and loyalty within the Righteous Qi Alliance.

The Finance Department cultivators had always relied on gathering Qi Luck to enhance their combat power. The current shift in public sentiment was clearly having a major impact on them.

Furthermore, the decline in morale would affect the production efficiency of countless factories and companies within the Alliance, reducing the output of various resources.

And on the Soul Transformation Battlefield, the Alliance's Soul Transformation experts were consuming vast quantities of these resources every second.

The production efficiency of rear-line resources directly impacted the Soul Transformation Battlefield at the front.

It could be said that the Soul Transformation War was not just a contest of cultivation and realms, but also a clash of the financial power, influence, and production capacity controlled by the Soul Transformation Cultivators.

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus, formerly the head of the Finance Department at Myriad Laws University, thought grimly, "Wavering morale and declining loyalty will weaken our Soul Transformation experts' combat strength."

"What a brilliant Money Scattering Technique. Was this part of your plan all along, Zhang Yu?"

Chain Nexus recalled the past when Zhang Yu was just a Civil Engineering student. He had invited Zhang Yu to tour the Finance Department, only to be rejected with the absurd excuse, "Can I join a sect instead?"

"To think that a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator from back then has grown into such a major figure in the blink of an eye."

"But the higher the risk, the greater the reward. If you hadn't disrupted the situation, we wouldn't have been able to derail Fu Xiantian's plans so smoothly, would we?"

He sneered, his gaze seemingly piercing through infinite space to land on Fu Xiantian, who was currently overseeing the great formation.

"An Immortal's disciple... Hmph. Now that Zhang Yu has thrown the situation into chaos and the Heavenly Court's return is imminent, it's time for you to reveal your trump cards, isn't it?"

"Let me see what you've prepared for us."

---

Meanwhile, the Auspicious God complained to the numerous Evil Gods, "I told you so! I said we needed to keep a close watch on Zhang Yu. If you had listened to me earlier, would this have happened? We should have been handling this with ease, but now we're scrambling frantically."

The Herald God interjected, "Enough, Auspicious God. Although the firmament being breached was unexpected, the advantage is still on our side."

"The Alliance Leader is about to unleash his ultimate technique."

As all the Evil Gods turned their attention toward the Alliance Leader, the Herald God unfurled the Evil God Register. The same question resurfaced in his mind.

"Fortune God... why are you on the side of the Ten Universities?"

With this thought, he activated the Evil God Register and called out to Lady Fortune.

---

Inside the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation, an invisible ripple emerged from Fu Xiantian's body, sweeping across the Spirit Realm and surging toward the Soul Transformation Cultivators of the Ten Universities.

During this past period, although Fu Xiantian had participated in the Soul Transformation Battlefield, he had never fought head-on with his full strength. This was because he had been making a single, crucial preparation...

At this moment, as his hands rotated like wheels, he seemed to stir the cycle of reincarnation within heaven and earth, emanating waves of mystical aura.

The next instant, he gently clenched his right fist, as if grasping something formless and intangible from the world itself.

Suddenly, a mournful wind howled through heaven and earth, accompanied by countless furious roars, agonizing screams, and desolate wails.

Innumerable dark, human-like figures abruptly appeared around him. After a brief, violent struggle, they were forcibly seized and drawn into Fu Xiantian's palm, converging toward its center.

The Evil Gods observing this scene cried out in alarm.

The Auspicious God exclaimed, "The Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture... The Alliance Leader has been holding back all this time, continuously comprehending the Heavenly Will and channeling the power of reincarnation to mentally connect with the wandering souls yet to be reborn."

"Now, with a single move, he has summoned tens of millions of wandering souls."

The Joy God, however, sighed, "The Ten Universities' Soul Transformation experts don't understand the Power of Reincarnation. They will be utterly helpless against this move. But it's a pity, a real pity. If the Alliance Leader had more time, this technique could have completely crushed them. But now, with the situation repeatedly disrupted and changing too quickly, this is the best he can do."

As the Evil Gods spoke, Fu Xiantian's consciousness locked onto each of the Soul Transformation Cultivators within the great formation.

The next moment, he unleashed a fierce punch. Tens of thousands of wandering souls swarmed out, vanishing into the atmosphere in an instant.

Outside the formation, True Monarch Immortal Slayer seemed to sense a change. His gaze suddenly sharpened. "The Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture? He's using it now? Shouldn't he have waited until he'd collected enough Soul Transformation wandering souls to wipe out both sides at once?"

But in the next instant, True Monarch Immortal Slayer understood. He sighed inwardly, "It's all that bastard Zhang Yu's fault for ruining everything."

Meanwhile, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, who was in the midst of battle, felt her gaze tighten. She suddenly sensed something burrowing into her body from the Spirit Realm.

A strange, unfamiliar memory abruptly surfaced in her mind.

"I... I'm Li Wuxiu? A junior college student?"

But before she could process this memory, another one surfaced in her mind. This time, she was a worker who had toiled for years, only to be consumed by fiend energy.

Memory after memory erupted wildly within Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's Sea of Consciousness.

In that moment, she seemed to be simultaneously a Qi Refining cultivator, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, a Golden Core cultivator, a Nascent Soul cultivator, and a Soul Transformation cultivator. She was human, monsterfolk, and Demon Beast all at once...

Hundreds, even thousands of contradictory and conflicting perceptions, memories, and sensations exploded in her Sea of Consciousness, sweeping through every corner of her mind like a storm.

If it were just one or two memories of impoverished individuals, they would have been insignificant in the vast expanse of Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's long life.

But now, the memories of hundreds, even thousands of the poor erupted within her, like a tsunami that completely engulfed her consciousness.

This technique was precisely the power of the Level 50 Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture: forcibly reincarnating thousands of wandering souls into Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's body, shattering her consciousness into thousands of fragments.

With a piercing scream, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's cultivation spiraled out of control, her combat power plummeting instantly.

She wasn't the only one. At that moment, more than half of the Soul Transformation experts in the Ten Universities' camp had been ambushed by the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture. Their strength waned rapidly, and they were forced into a continuous retreat.

"Sinful Lotus!" Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole called out repeatedly through the Spirit Realm. "What are you all doing?"

But the only response she received was Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's incoherent babbling — one moment lamenting unpaid loans, the next despairing over failing university entrance exams...

As the battle lines crumbled, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood had no choice but to step forward to the front lines, simultaneously commanding the troops and trying to stabilize the situation.

But in the blink of an eye, two more Soul Transformation experts from the Ten Universities fell, reducing their numbers to just thirty-two. Their disadvantage grew even more severe.

"Everyone, hold your ground!" Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's roar echoed across the Spirit Realm, reaching the ears of every Soul Transformation expert. "Follow my commands! Converge on my position!"

"Forces outside have already begun attacking the formation nodes! As long as we hold out until the great formation is broken, we can retreat!"

While commanding the Soul Transformation Battlefield, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had already transmitted a series of orders to break the formation to the forces outside.

At that moment, the numerous Nascent Soul True Monarchs from the Ten Universities, who had successively arrived on the Fifth Layer, all received their instructions.

"Heavenly Slaughter, head thirty degrees east-northeast for 1,200 kilometers. Locate and destroy the formation node there."

"String Tone, proceed to these coordinates..."

As the commands were issued one by one, the Nascent Soul experts from each university sprang into action. They were like giant dragons opening their maws and extending their claws, tearing at the various nodes of the great formation.

But the Righteous Qi Alliance on the other side would not simply allow the Ten Universities to dismantle their formation.

Fu Xiantian also issued orders to his Nascent Soul experts, commanding them to defend the formation nodes and hold out until the Soul Transformation War was won.

And beyond that...

"Great Luminosity, go and slaughter all those Lower College students from the High Schools and Vocational Colleges who have made it up here."

Fu Xiantian's gaze seemed to pierce through thousands of kilometers, locking onto the horde of impoverished cultivators who had just broken through the firmament and arrived on the Fifth Layer.

As the Heaven-Piercing Operation progressed smoothly, a vast number of low-level cultivators activated the Great Void Cloud Repository, broke through the firmament, and surged onto the Fifth Layer. In a short time, their numbers swelled from hundreds of thousands to millions, then tens of millions, and even over a hundred million.

And their numbers continued to grow, surging upward like a volcanic eruption.

Faced with this situation, although Zhang Yu had already issued a notice for them to retreat quickly, the hundred million people were packed together, some pushing upward, others pushing downward, like a clogged sewer. They could not be easily or quickly evacuated.

For the Soul Transformation Cultivators of the two factions, a few dozen seconds or a few minutes might be enough to complete high-speed communications and several lightning-fast rounds of combat.

But for the slow-moving Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators, this was far too short a time...

So when Fu Xiantian gave the order, over a hundred million impoverished cultivators still swarmed the lands of the Kunxu Fifth Layer.

Hearing Fu Xiantian's command, True Monarch Great Luminosity was momentarily stunned. "Slaughter... all of them?"

As a former cultivator from the Finance Department of Netherworld University, who had mastered the "Mysterious Canon of Ancestral Transference", True Monarch Great Luminosity knew exactly what this meant.

"Over a hundred million people... slaughtering them all... What would be the losses? It would cause a labor shortage and trigger economic turmoil, wouldn't it?" he thought.

"Besides, after we defeat the Ten Great Universities and rule Layers 2 through 5, we'll need these poor bastards."

To True Monarch Great Luminosity, this order seemed even more extravagant than Zhang Yu's money-burning tactics, more costly than the sky full of Great Void Red Envelopes, yet he couldn't see any benefit.

Utterly bewildered by Fu Xiantian's command, he couldn't help but ask, "Alliance Leader, over a hundred million people... kill them all?"

Fu Xiantian's icy voice echoed across the Spirit Realm: "Do I need to give the order a second time?"

Just then, True Monarch Immortal Slayer, also in the combat group, spoke up. "Master, let me go."

True Monarch Immortal Slayer understood that slaughtering these impoverished cultivators would provide a fresh batch of wandering souls, helping Fu Xiantian rapidly accumulate power for the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture.

"Moreover," he thought, "if we let these poor bastards go back, they'll only aid the Ten Universities, helping their Soul Transformation Experts continue production and slowing the progress of the Soul Transformation War."

"And with the Heavenly Court potentially descending at any moment, killing them now makes it easier to reincarnate them into the New World whenever necessary."

"Zhang Yu..." He gazed at the direction where the hundred million people had gathered, thinking, "You may have incited these hundred million to pierce the firmament, but you've also delivered a trove of combat resources right to our doorstep. Did you foresee this?"

Fearing that True Monarch Great Luminosity might not fully grasp Fu Xiantian's intentions and thus hold back in battle, True Monarch Immortal Slayer proactively volunteered.

But Fu Xiantian responded to his offer with a detached tone: "Immortal Slayer, focus on your own mission. Guard the great formation's nodes and ensure no one interferes with this battle."

"Great Luminosity, leave no one alive. Do you understand?"

"Otherwise, what I can give, I can also take away."

"If you still acknowledge me as your godfather, do as I say."

Feeling Fu Xiantian's overwhelming pressure sweep across the Spirit Realm, True Monarch Great Luminosity accepted the order. "I understand."

The next moment, he led True Monarch Flowing Gold, True Monarch Joyful Ease, and a total of twenty - one Nascent Soul True Monarchs, charging toward the hundred million impoverished cultivators like tigers pouncing on a flock of sheep.

Though a hundred million people seemed like a vast number, True Monarch Great Luminosity was confident that with their Nascent Soul cultivation, they could vaporize these poor bastards in a short time.

The Ten Universities quickly noticed the Righteous Qi Alliance's unusual movements. However, neither Divine Monarchs like Magnetic Pole nor Nascent Soul True Monarchs like Heavenly Slaughter suspected True Monarch Great Luminosity's true objective.

After all, in their minds, low-level cultivators were valuable assets to the universities. Losing one or two was acceptable, but who would be deranged enough to slaughter a hundred million?

Though they didn't know the enemy's objective, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, acting on the principle of thwarting their opponents, dispatched over a dozen Nascent Soul cultivators led by True Monarch Celestial Seal to intercept True Monarch Great Luminosity and his group.

Facing the Ten Universities' Nascent Soul cultivators, True Monarch Great Luminosity formed a Dao Seal with his hands. Four spatial barriers instantly materialized in the atmosphere, forming a magnificent pathway that blocked waves of attacks while leading directly to their target.

Feeling the surging cultivation from the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier coursing through his body, a flicker of excitement crossed True Monarch Great Luminosity's eyes.

"The Qi Luck of an Immortal's disciple is truly extraordinary."

"With this Qi Luck, I can even break through the bottleneck of the Mysterious Canon of Ancestral Transference..."

Gazing at the Nascent Soul cultivators trapped outside the spatial barriers, True Monarch Great Luminosity clasped his hands and knelt toward them with lightning speed.

As he knelt, several Nascent Soul cultivators cried out in alarm, discovering their cultivation was rapidly draining away.

True Monarch Celestial Seal retreated abruptly, exclaiming in shock, "It's the Mysterious Canon of Ancestral Transference!"

"How can he kneel to several of us at once?"

"Watch out! Don't stand in front of him!"

True Monarch Great Luminosity advanced, wielding the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier in one hand and the Mysterious Canon of Ancestral Transference in the other. With each step, he knelt, and with each kneel, he advanced. No one dared stand in his path. In an instant, he was poised above the crowd of low-level cultivators.

Seeing True Monarch Great Luminosity's next move, True Monarch Celestial Seal was stunned. "They're here to kill these paupers?"

True Monarch Celestial Seal and the others could never have imagined that True Monarch Great Luminosity's squad of Nascent Soul True Monarchs had launched a surprise attack just to slaughter these high school and vocational college students.

Of course, they couldn't possibly fathom that True Monarch Great Luminosity intended to kill not just hundreds or thousands, but every single poor cultivator present.

At that moment, intimidated by the threat of the Mysterious Canon of Ancestral Transference and feeling that killing a few vocational college students was no great loss, True Monarch Celestial Seal and his group held back. Instead, they planned to wait for True Monarch Great Luminosity to strike, then exploit any openings to attack.

On the ground below, Chang Buxiu looked up at the sky but could see nothing clearly.

The combined power of over twenty Nascent Soul cultivators was so immense that it far surpassed his ability to perceive or observe.

He felt as if over twenty suns were slowly descending from the sky. The terrifying power shook his magic power so violently that he could barely circulate it.

The unprecedentedly dreadful pressure bore down on him like mountains, crushing him until he couldn't exert any strength, extinguishing all hope in his heart, and rendering him immobile.

Looking at the vocational college students collapsing all around him, Chang Buxiu despaired. "Are we going to die?"

In that moment, a flicker of regret ignited in his heart.

"Why did we even come to this battlefield?"

"Soul Transformation War, Nascent Soul War... what business did we have getting involved?"

He recalled countless stories, videos, and movies where Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators were crushed like weeds.

"This battlefield was never a place for us."

"No one cares about us."

"And no one will protect us... We're just weeds..."

Just as despair consumed Chang Buxiu, a figure shattered the atmosphere, descending before them wrapped in a whirlwind.

Zhang Yu stared at True Monarch Great Luminosity and said coldly, "You like kneeling?"

The next moment, as Zhang Yu clapped his hands together, the radiant light from the twenty-plus Nascent Souls instantly extinguished.

"Then kneel for the rest of your life."
