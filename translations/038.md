# Chapter 38: Level 10 Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method

Turning her head to look at Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen asked in surprise, "Are you sure?"

"Yu-boy, don't make this decision so lightly."

"Trying for one of the Ten Greats means you'll be making enemies with countless people in Songyang City."

"You're not just saying this to sound impressive, are you?"

Zhang Yu retorted angrily, "What the hell... I'm being serious with you. Do you think I'm joking?"

Seeing his serious expression, Bai Zhenzhen suddenly smiled. "Fine, we'll say you're also aiming for the Ten Greats."

"They gave you a month to consider, didn't they?"

"The deadline they gave me is in one month."

"For the next two weeks, you should focus on improving yourself. I'll take you to meet some people at the Mana Competition."

"The Mana Competition?" Zhang Yu's interest was piqued. He recalled that the competition he had signed up for was set to begin this month, in just two weeks.

"Meet people there? Who are we meeting?"

Bai Zhenzhen said mysteriously, "People who might be able to help us."

_Damn riddlers._

Zhang Yu pressed, "Who exactly?"

Bai Zhenzhen replied, "I'm not entirely sure myself yet. You'll find out when the time comes."

Helpless, Zhang Yu could only resolve to focus all his energy on self-improvement in the time that followed.

In any case, the only thing he could truly control right now was his own strength.

...

During martial arts class.

"Daoist arts are useless."

"It's the martial path that's truly useful."

"When you're cornered and come face-to-face with an opponent, masterful martial skill is the most reliable tool you have."

"In that moment, there are only two outcomes: either you kill your opponent, or you end up on the ground, killed by them..."

Listening to the speech from the martial arts teacher, Lei Jun, He Dayou secretly rolled his eyes, clearly unimpressed by this tirade.

Just then, Lei Jun announced, "Alright, break into groups for combat practice."

"He Dayou, you're with Zhang Yu."

"Huh?" He Dayou was stunned, instinctively looking at Lei Jun and pointing to himself.

Lei Jun snorted coldly. "What are you looking at? You lost miserably on the monthly exam. With results that poor, did you even go home and reflect on it?"

"I'm giving you another chance now to learn from Zhang Yu. Are you unwilling?"

Weighed down by the banner of his poor performance in the monthly martial arts combat exam, even the son of a school director like He Dayou was left speechless.

After all, in the current climate where a poor student could do no right, He Dayou couldn't defy the teacher in class.

_This damn old martial arts codger, picking on a top Daoist arts student, is he?_

He walked silently to stand before Zhang Yu, thinking, _But I might not actually lose to Zhang Yu this time._

Despite three consecutive losses to Zhang Yu, and though He Dayou didn't intend to hold a grudge, it didn't mean he wouldn't reflect and re-evaluate his own performance.

He had not only rewatched the recordings of those three fights many times himself, but had also shown them to his private combat tutor for review.

The analysis concluded that Zhang Yu's Freehand Combat had reached the third level. Once he spotted an opening, he could easily inflict heavy damage.

But Zhang Yu's weakness was also obvious: the third match showed his extreme lack of practical combat experience.

So, He Dayou had practiced a few countermeasures.

For instance, on the platform now, he no longer took the initiative, instead focusing entirely on defense, waiting for his opponent to grow impatient before looking for a chance to strike with a surprise Lesser Heavenly Star Palm...

With a strategy in mind, He Dayou believed that even if he lost, it wouldn't be a disgraceful defeat—he might even have a chance to win.

Pow!

Pow!

Pow!

After blocking several of Zhang Yu's consecutive moves, He Dayou felt fine at first.

But soon he felt his opponent's fists growing heavier and heavier, making his hands ache from blocking, and the mana within him began to churn.

Boom!

Another of Zhang Yu's punches blasted right through his guard, followed by a kick that sent He Dayou flying.

He crashed to the ground with a thud, feeling his internal mana surge so violently that for a moment, he couldn't even get up.

_Zhang Yu's Freehand Combat is even stronger than before?_

_Could he have..._

He Dayou looked at Zhang Yu in disbelief.

On the other side, Lei Jun's figure flashed and appeared beside Zhang Yu, exclaiming in shock, "Your Freehand Combat is at the fourth level?"

Zhang Yu, whose Freehand Combat was actually at the fifth level, gave an awkward smile.

"Yeah, I just broke through yesterday."

Zhang Yu hadn't intended to reveal his progress, and had been deliberately suppressing the power of his Freehand Combat while fighting He Dayou.

But his lack of experience showed. When He Dayou switched to a full defense, Zhang Yu accidentally lost control during his fierce assault and pushed the circulation of his mana and vital energy to the fourth level of power.

Hearing this, Lei Jun laughed heartily. "It seems you have quite a talent for the martial path."

"What do you say? Want to participate in next month's Songyang City Martial Combat Tournament?"

Zhang Yu's eyes lit up. "Is there prize money?"

Lei Jun replied, "Of course. First place in the city gets fifty thousand, plus the right to use an expert-grade martial technique."

Zhang Yu thought, _The Mana Competition I signed up for has a prize, and this martial combat tournament does too..._

He suddenly realized that if he could win more placements and prizes in competitions, then even without the student council's support, he should have enough money for daily expenses and even to speed up his training.

Seeing Zhang Yu's interest, Lei Jun continued, "I've told you all before that martial arts are incredibly useful. As long as you're good in a real fight, you won't have to worry about money."

"I'll sign you up then. When the time comes, I'll take you and Bai Zhenzhen together."

After Lei Jun left, Zhang Yu looked at He Dayou, who was still on the ground, and asked, "Are you alright?"

"I'm fine, what could happen to me?" He Dayou scrambled to his feet, gave Zhang Yu a deep look, and suddenly said, "I heard the student council called you in yesterday?"

After Zhang Yu nodded, He Dayou slowly quelled the anger in his heart.

_No point getting angry with him. It's all school property, and it doesn't affect my college entrance exams._

He comforted himself while rubbing his chest, _Being a little stronger or weaker in combat during the first year doesn't mean much. Once I've built a solid foundation and start practicing expert-grade cultivation techniques, I'll be able to crush people like Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen._

On the other side of the training grounds, Bai Zhenzhen said impatiently, "Are you done watching? Let's continue."

Qian Shen pulled his gaze away from Zhang Yu, but as he faced Bai Zhenzhen, he felt waves of pressure wash over him.

If he were facing a demi-human with a score of 550, he was confident he could crush them.

But facing a prodigy with a score of 651, Qian Shen felt as if his every move was seen through, and the moment he engaged with Bai Zhenzhen, he felt completely constrained, his combat power dropping sharply.

_My score is so much lower than hers, how could I possibly be her opponent? Old Lei is really something else. He should have paired me with Zhang Yu, whose score is six points lower than mine._

Zhang Yu glanced at He Dayou, Qian Shen, and the other rich kids, a thought suddenly crossing his mind. What would these seemingly friendly, wealthy students be like once they found out he and Bai Zhenzhen were aiming for the Ten Greats?

Would they also join forces to oppose him and Zhen?

Watching Qian Shen being completely suppressed by Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu mused, _Speaking of which, Qian Shen is such a score-supremacist, it's like he's completely unaware that poor students have no path to the Ten Greats. Could he be acting?_

Zhang Yu didn't think so; Qian-boy's naivety didn't seem like an act.

It couldn't be one of those "let the young master focus on his studies and shield him from the filth of society" scenarios, could it?

Zhang Yu shook his head, unable to be sure.

...

During Daoist arts class.

The instructor looked at He Dayou with admiration.

"This Health Check Talisman is well-drawn. It seems your understanding of the talismans of the God of Health and Verdant Spring is already profound."

He Dayou replied humbly, "You praise me too much, teacher. I still have much to learn."

The instructor waved his hand. "Excessive humility is just another form of pride."

"To have reached this level in your first year, He Dayou... I'd say you don't even need to attend the school's first-year courses anymore."

"It's fine if you don't attend this class from now on; I'll mark you as present."

Feeling the envious gazes of his classmates, He Dayou once again offered humble refusals.

The instructor, however, suddenly turned his head.

"Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen, you two need to work harder."

"It's not good to be so lopsided in your studies."

"If you have time, come to me for some tutoring. I'll give you both a twenty percent discount..."

Both Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu could only lower their heads and take the lecture, though inwardly they were unmoved. The return on investment for talisman tutoring was simply too low, and they planned to spend their money on more practical things first.

...

In the quiet room.

The administrator, Wei Xin's, voice came through.

"Student Zhang Yu, your time is almost up. Would you like to extend?"

Zhang Yu, who had once again achieved the lowest rate of distraction for the week, hesitated for a moment before saying, "Add another hour."

With the Mana Competition drawing ever closer, Zhang Yu decided it was time to moderately increase the pace of his mana cultivation.

He took a deep breath, feeling a tremor from the Sea of Qi Spiritual Root within his dantian as spiritual energy swarmed in from all directions, which he then refined into mana, strand by painstaking strand.

An hour later, watching Zhang Yu's departing figure, Wei Xin sighed, "As expected of a Golden Core disciple. The efficiency of his breathing exercises is improving so quickly."

"I just wish he'd upgrade to a platinum membership already."

...

After school.

On the school rooftop.

Amidst a flurry of sharp cracks, two figures collided repeatedly at high speed, creating sounds like thunder and wind.

It was Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, engaged in a sparring match.

Compared to the drills in their combat class, their private sessions allowed them to go all out without fear of revealing their trump cards, which was far more effective for improving their practical experience.

In the exchange of fists and feet, Zhang Yu's Freehand Combat was more powerful, but his physical strength was a notch below Bai Zhenzhen's.

And while Bai Zhenzhen's Freehand Combat level was lower than his, she had also mastered a basic high school sword art, periodically weaving in sword-finger strikes that sent the inexperienced Zhang Yu scrambling.

"Yu-boy, don't watch my hands. You need to watch my hips and shoulders to anticipate my moves."

"Stop trying to rely only on your familiarity with Freehand Combat to react..."

...

In the stationery shop by the school gate.

The owner pointed to the first-year rankings.

"Zhang Yu, third in his year, improved by seventy points in one month because he bought my tranquilizers, painkillers, fillers, and muscle supplements..."

As he spoke, he took out a bag of vials and pitched to the Songyang students before him, "The official Zhang Yu training combo, now ten percent off."

Zhang Yu, who had come to restock, stood at the doorway watching the adult behind the counter shamelessly peddling his wares for profit, and once again felt the ugliness of the adult world.

After that group of students left, Zhang Yu walked up and said, "See? I told you I was a campus celebrity. My endorsement really moves product."

"Isn't it time for a raise?"

The owner replied, displeased, "I still haven't broken even on that batch of neural fillers I gave you."

He pointed a finger toward a gift bag. "Look, I've only sold one set today."

Zhang Yu thought, _You're just selling common stuff that's no cheaper than online. People can buy it anywhere._

The owner added, "And about the body tempering medicine, a lot of students are saying you're a natural and don't use enhancers."

Zhang Yu quickly changed the subject. "That's just because I haven't been seen using your products enough at school. Give me two more bottles of neural fillers, and I'll take them every day on campus. That'll be better for publicity."

...

Reading, classes, cultivation, breathing exercises, combat...

For five days, Zhang Yu threw all of his energy into his training.

This evening, while performing his breathing exercises in bed, a smile crept onto his lips.

After completing his final breathing cycle, his Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method had finally reached the tenth level.

In that instant, the mana circulation within Zhang Yu's body swelled, surging endlessly like a great river, and a phantom whistling sound seemed to ring in his ears.

A long while later, as the turbulence in his mana circulation gradually subsided, Zhang Yu could feel his passive breathing exercises had become more powerful and more dynamic.

"Now that the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method has reached the tenth level, my passive breathing has the full efficiency of active breathing."

The smile on Zhang Yu's face widened. This meant that from now on, even if he wasn't actively performing his breathing exercises, it would be as if he were constantly circulating the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method to absorb spiritual energy, his mana improving every moment of the day.

And after this period of ascetic training, his mana had also grown considerably, rising to 13.3 and making him second in the entire grade.

At this thought, a strange expression crossed Zhang Yu's face.

"My potential is astonishing and my self-discipline is peerless, so it's not surprising that I'm improving this fast."

"But how is it that Zhen's progress has also seemed to be speeding up lately?"

"Is she using a cheat, too?"
