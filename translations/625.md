# Chapter 625: Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture - Urgent! Urgent! Urgent!

As Zhang Yu had predicted, Ying Zhoufan wouldn't refuse a business deal.

Under Ying Zhoufan's persuasive salesmanship, Zhang Yu purchased blood from three high-grade monsterfolk.

Ying Zhoufan's efficiency lived up to his reputation as an academic overachiever at Celestial Monsters University. Within approximately two hours, he had the blood delivered to Zhang Yu.

"So fast... Could this be blood from members of the Celestial Monsters School Team?"

Zhang Yu dripped the blood onto the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, sensing the armor analyzing the hidden information within the monsterfolk bloodline.

He wasn't worried about anyone suspecting why he was buying monster blood.

After all, the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor bred Demon Beasts, and monster blood could accelerate the breeding process. Besides completing the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture, the purchased blood could also be used in future combat and production.

"No issues."

After confirming that the high-grade monsterfolk bloodlines could complete the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture, Zhang Yu placed another order with Ying Zhoufan.

Meanwhile, the company's recruitment efforts had quickly gathered a batch of low-grade monsterfolk blood, which Zhang Yu had expedited via high-speed courier services.

As the monster blood continued to accumulate, the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture gradually completed in Zhang Yu's mind — a profound, complex, and deeply insightful daoist arts cultivation art.

"The Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture is rooted in the Monsterfolk Bloodline, allowing one to transform into various monsterfolk forms."

"But if that were all, it would be no different from the Celestial Demon Myriad Transformations taught at Celestial Monsters University."

"The true power of the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture lies in its ability to create monsterfolk avatars."

"At Level 10, one can manifest two monsterfolk avatars; at Level 20, four avatars. This number aligns with the number of consciousnesses within the Immeasurable Heart Inner Dharma Body."

"As a daoist art cultivation technique reaching Level 80, when combined with the Remnant Ox's Self-Sacrifice Heart Sutra and the Immeasurable Heart Inner Dharma Body, it could allow a single person to become an army. One individual could conjure a legion of monsters with extraordinary regenerative abilities and diverse monsterfolk powers..."

Delving into its intricacies, Zhang Yu realized that based on its power, this cultivation technique was at least military-grade, making all his efforts worthwhile.

"But monsterfolk avatars are too easily detectable."

Zhang Yu thought that if he directly used this technique, others would quickly notice something was amiss.

"Fortunately, the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor already possesses the ability to breed Demon Beasts. Once I master the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture, I can use the armor as a cover, and it should pose no major problems."

With this in mind, Zhang Yu continued studying the cultivation art, registering it in his Feather Book.

However, like other daoist cultivation arts, the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture couldn't be mastered through solitary practice alone. Cultivating this art required continuously refining Monsterfolk Bloodlines and collecting vast quantities of monster blood.

Moreover, the type of Monsterfolk Bloodline mattered. Blood from both low-tier and high-tier monsterfolk was needed, and in substantial amounts.

To master this art quickly, Zhang Yu had no choice but to continue his company's recruitment efforts, focusing on gathering low-tier monster blood.

Simultaneously, he persisted in importing high-tier monster blood from Ying Zhoufan.

In the following days, Zhang Yu repeatedly practiced the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture. As he consumed massive quantities of monster blood, particularly the high-tier varieties, his Spirit Coin reserves dwindled rapidly.

Coupled with the repairs to his Seven Absolutes Bionic and the maintenance of his magical artifacts, Zhang Yu's Spirit Coins were vanishing at an alarming rate.

Fortunately, the revenue from the naming rights to his signature move in the previous competition, along with the advertising fees from the finals, were deposited into his account. Zhang Yu's balance surged to over 400 Spirit Coins, leaving him well-stocked with resources.

On Zhang Yu's Flying Boat, in a room with all devices shut down and Spirit Realm connections severed, Zhang Yu formed a Dao Seal with his hands. As his Magic Power circulated, he cast a series of restrictions, extracting strands of fiend energy from the vials of monster blood before him and refining them into his Dantian.

The fiend energy then coursed through his body, gradually merging with his flesh and blood, granting his physical body a transformative ability.

As another cultivation session concluded, Zhang Yu's mind seemed to echo with the roars of countless monsterfolk.

For a moment, he felt as if he had transformed into various great demons — flying through the skies, diving into the earth, moving mountains, and overturning seas — battling against the very forces of nature.

Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture: Level 5 (0/50)

Looking at the Level 5 daoist arts on his status panel, Zhang Yu nodded slightly. At this rate, reaching Level 11, the Foundation Establishment realm, before the next finals should be no problem.

In the next instant, with a thought, a strand of hair was blown down by his Body-Protecting Qi and floated before him.

Immediately, the hair twisted, swelled, and transformed, resembling a mass of living flesh that emitted low growls.

Zhang Yu knew that by continuing to circulate his cultivation art, he could use this single strand of hair as a foundation to summon a monsterfolk avatar. Whether it would manifest as an Eagle Monster, Pig Monster, Lion Monster, or some other creature depended on the Monsterfolk Bloodline he refined and his own choice.

This monsterfolk avatar would function like an additional limb, completely under his control, possessing the physical strength of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and inheriting some of the monsterfolk's unique abilities.

"However, a monsterfolk avatar created from a single strand of hair would only last a few minutes before collapsing and dissipating."

"The more flesh and blood invested in the transformation, the longer the avatar's duration and the closer its physical strength would approach mine. It could even inherit the Remnant Ox's Self-Sacrifice Heart Sutra's physical vitality enhancement ability."

"If I could channel Magic Power and Gang Qi through a sword formation, controlling the avatar to execute martial arts would be effortless."

"Equipping the avatar with magical artifacts would further amplify its combat prowess exponentially."

In the next instant, a swirl of Gang Qi completely obliterated the still-transforming mass of hair, reducing it to nothingness in the air.

"Using it directly is still too obvious," Zhang Yu mused. "To deploy it in the finals, I'll need to rely on the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor for camouflage."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "In that case, I'll need to buy more aquatic monsterfolk blood. That way, when I use the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor to breed aquatic Demon Beasts, I can mix in my own monsterfolk avatar."

"Naturally, the monsterfolk avatars I summon will primarily be aquatic types."

Just then, Zi Yunzhen's voice called out from beyond the door, "Boss? Are you there?"

Zhang Yu's gaze flickered. He had publicly announced his seclusion to refine magical artifacts, and he knew his assistants wouldn't disturb him unless it was urgent.

"What is it?" Zhang Yu asked.

"Bai Zhenzhen from Heavenly Sword University wants you to check your messages," Zi Yunzhen replied.

Zhang Yu's heart quickened. He reconnected to the Spirit Realm through his Bionic Eye and saw a flurry of messages from Bai Zhenzhen.

Bai Zhenzhen: Hurry over!

Bai Zhenzhen: Where are you?

Bai Zhenzhen: Urgent! Urgent! Urgent!

When Zhang Yu arrived at Bai Zhenzhen's Flying Boat, he found it completely deserted.

Entering Bai Zhenzhen's room, he still couldn't find her. Instead, he noticed a hole in the wall.

Curiously examining the hole, Zhang Yu was puzzled when Bai Zhenzhen's voice suddenly echoed from within: "Yu Zi, lean close to the hole."

He leaned closer, asking, "What's wrong, A-Zhen?"

Bai Zhenzhen replied, "My Master has gone to attend the Four Schools' Soul Transformation gathering to discuss the Grand League competition. She's too preoccupied to pay attention here."

"This is a rare opportunity. I've shut down all communication devices on the Flying Boat."

"It's been so long since we last met beneath the arena at Heavenly Sword University... since we last did that..."

Hearing her mention "that," Zhang Yu immediately understood she was referring to their plan to exchange Divine Spiritual Roots.

With their telepathic connection, there was no need to explicitly mention "Divine Spiritual Root," which would only increase the risk. A simple "that" sufficed.

Zhang Yu had been eagerly awaiting this opportunity. However, since the Ten Greats League began, they had been surrounded by Heavenly Chosen from the Ten Great Universities, and the Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' occasional scrutiny had made any rash action too dangerous.

Zhang Yu approached the cave entrance and asked, "Is Divine Monarch Seven Emotions really gone?"

He immediately recalled Dao Qiankun's earlier intelligence about Soul Transformation.

A gathering of Soul Transformation experts from the four schools? Zhang Yu thought to himself. Are the Soul Transformation experts from Myriad Laws, Vajra, Immortal Armaments, and Heavenly Sword also planning to unite their forces and support Dao Qiankun in opposing Kuang Tianqing and the Four Heavenly Demon Schools?

"If it's such a major event, the Divine Monarch Seven Emotions probably truly doesn't have time to pay attention here."

But then Zhang Yu's thoughts shifted. "Yet your sword qi erupts whenever you get close to me, attracting the attention of others."

Bai Zhenzhen's voice came from behind the cave. "That's why I made this cave."

"As long as I can't see you in person and only perceive 'that,' I should be able to suppress it now."

"Hurry up."

Bai Zhenzhen urged him again, "The old biddy could return at any moment. Quickly align it with the cave entrance."

Since Bai Zhenzhen had said so, Zhang Yu decided to trust her. Moreover, to compete for first place in the Ten Greats League, he couldn't afford to easily give up any method that could enhance his strength.

Zhang Yu leaned against the wall, positioning his Divine Spiritual Root as close to the cave entrance as possible.

In the next moment, he felt the Divine Spiritual Root surge forward, plunging directly into Bai Zhenzhen's Dantian in a single breath.

Simultaneously, Bai Zhenzhen's Spiritual Root leaped into Zhang Yu's Dantian.

As the Spiritual Roots exchanged places, a strange sensation enveloped them both, causing them to tremble slightly.

This was the Divine Spiritual Root's initial adaptation and strengthening within their respective bodies, gradually feeding back into their exchanged physical bodies.

Their vital energy, Magic Power, physical strength, endurance, bone density, and overall bodily resistances were all being altered by the Divine Spiritual Root.

Especially since it had been so long since their last exchange, the differences between their bodies were now greater, making the resulting changes even more intense.

Bai Zhenzhen forcefully suppressed the urge to cry out and unleash her sword qi, gritting her teeth as she asked, "Yu Zi, how are you feeling?"

Zhang Yu replied, "It feels... very strange. I can sense your Dantian."

Bai Zhenzhen took a deep breath and said, "I... I can feel yours too."

Immediately afterward, Bai Zhenzhen felt the feedback from the Divine Spiritual Root growing increasingly intense and powerful.
