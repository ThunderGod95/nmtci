# Chapter 695: Space Ecosystem, Zhang Yu Under Scrutiny

Unlike the hasty demonstration of the As-You-Wish Size Ring last time, Zhang Yu and Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole now had ample time to plan meticulously. They established a company in advance, stockpiled materials, set up production lines, opened factories, and secured sales channels.

Unlike the Spatial Technology Research Association, which accepted investments from the Ten Universities for research and development, the company jointly funded by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, Divine Monarch Greenwood, and Zhang Yu focused solely on producing and selling their upcoming new products.

To this end, Zhang Yu invested all his Spirit Coins into the company. Combined with the technical equity calculated by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, he became the company's largest shareholder.

The company also accepted investments from the three Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs of Myriad Laws: Tranquility, Cloud Haven, and Azure Void.

Under Zhang Yu's guidance, his original Civil Engineering Company had also begun preparations ahead of schedule, ensuring they were fully prepared for the upcoming market.

Though Zhang Yu's account now held only a few dozen Spirit Coins, seemingly returning him to his former poverty, his heart was filled with anticipation. He had unwavering confidence in the products he and Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had designed.

As the day of the press conference drew near, Zhang Yu's heart couldn't help but flutter with anxiety.

When his consciousness entered the Spirit Realm's conference venue, he saw the invited audience already waiting, their eyes fixed on the various Spirit Realm Projections.

In the front row of the audience seats, the divine light representing the Soul Transformation experts from each university floated silently like ancient natural wonders.

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets of Immortal Armaments University thought to himself, "What scheme is Magnetic Pole up to now? Whatever it is, we'll just copy it."

"Magnetic Pole, since you accepted massive investments from the other nine universities, you must share all the technologies from the Open Source Research Association... No matter what product you release, we'll ultimately replicate it."

"And with similar technological capabilities, my university will inevitably triumph through superior cost-effectiveness and extreme cost compression."

Just then, the Spirit Realm's conference venue suddenly darkened, all light converging on the stage, focusing on the gradually materializing figure of Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

Today, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole no longer projected a crude Spirit Realm avatar. Instead, she fully manifested her true form from the material world.

With a gentle smile, she addressed the crowd, "I am deeply moved today. After countless days and nights of tireless effort by our entire team, we are proud to unveil a revolutionary product that will transform the way all cultivators live."

As she spoke, a projection from the material world appeared on the stage.

It was a palm-sized pouch, its surface a striking blend of black and gold.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole explained, "This is the Great Void Cloud Repository, which I call the Personal Space Platform."

"Previously, the As-You-Wish Size Ring could shrink items for storage."

"Now, we have sealed a fixed Scaling Space within this pouch. Through Spatial Compression Technology, this palm-sized area can store vast quantities of resources."

The projection demonstrated how various items, after being miniaturized, were effortlessly deposited into the pouch. Despite its compact size, the space seemed to hold an astonishing amount of material.

As she spoke, data streams materialized behind Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, displaying the specifications of different versions of the Great Void Cloud Repository:

* Standard Edition: 30 cubic meters
* Deluxe Edition: 150 cubic meters
* Ultimate Edition: 500 cubic meters

These figures represented the maximum volume of matter that could be compressed into the Great Void Cloud Repository: 30 cubic meters, 150 cubic meters, and 500 cubic meters, respectively.

"But it's more than just storage," she continued. "It's a personal Small World, a Personal Space capable of deflecting attacks and protecting its user."

The demonstration expanded the Great Void Cloud Repository's Scaling Space like a shield. Combining the space-bending technology of Kunlun in the Palm, it distorted and deflected various attacks through spatial manipulation.

The term "Small World" was, of course, a marketing exaggeration, but the demonstrated effects undeniably captivated countless viewers.

"By customizing and manipulating this space, you can unlock a myriad of extraordinary spatial applications."

"By distorting and scaling space, we can achieve applications such as accelerated movement and spatial locks."

"In the future, based on this Personal Space Platform, a wide variety of spatial applications will be developed, impacting every aspect of everyone's lives..."

In addition to Great Void Cloud Repository, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole also introduced Flying Boats utilizing Great Void Cloud Repository technology and Intelligent Construction products incorporating Great Void Cloud Repository's spatial compression technology.

As Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole presented each product, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, who was watching the launch event, grew increasingly somber.

He murmured, "Magnetic Pole... how has she developed so many new creations in such a short time?"

Especially after hearing the detailed explanation of Great Void Cloud Repository, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus's gaze remained fixed on the product.

"A Personal Space Platform?" Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus sighed. "She's trying to establish an entire Personal Space Ecosystem and bring us all into it."

Divine Monarch Wuchang, who was also from Heavenly Demon University, asked in confusion, "A Personal Space Ecosystem?"

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus pointed to his Bionic Eye and said, "This Great Void Cloud Repository Personal Space is like the Bionic Eye everyone has. The Bionic Eye contains various applications and services, making it an indispensable product for every cultivator."

"What Magnetic Pole aims to create is something similar — a Personal Space for every cultivator, a platform where countless Space applications can develop, forming an entire ecosystem..."

Divine Monarch Wuchang nodded, immediately understanding. "But the Research Association's Spatial Technology is open to us. If we wanted to design a similar product, we should be able to, right?"

At this, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus grew serious. "Magnetic Pole isn't foolish. She didn't try to monopolize everything with Myriad Laws' power alone, only to be besieged by everyone else. So... while she gave herself a head start, she also gave all the academies a chance to compete."

"By sharing the Research Association's technology, anyone with the capability will try to join this competition, attempting to build a complete Personal Space Ecosystem."

"The upcoming market will likely be a free-for-all, with countless Personal Space products mimicking Magnetic Pole's design flooding the market. Everyone will be vying for dominance, leading to fierce competition."

"Ultimately, the victor will seize the entire market..."

Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus estimated, "In the end, two or three Space Ecosystems will likely monopolize the market. Most users will only purchase these two or three types of Personal Space, giving rise to two or three colossal corporations."

"The failing schools will be forced to cater to these two or three dominant Personal Spaces, developing Space applications based on the Spatial Technology shared by the Research Association, and scraping by on the leftovers."

"Magnetic Pole... you truly live up to your reputation as my formidable rival. You consistently exceed my expectations. Since achieving Soul Transformation, every move you make has unleashed a world-altering storm."

"Your understanding of Spatial Technology far surpasses that of the Righteous Qi Alliance's Finance Department Immortal Scum."

"But I... will catch up to you."

With this resolve, Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus transmitted a message to Heavenly Demon University.

"Heavenly Demon University must establish its own Personal Space Ecosystem. We must become one of the final victors."

"Immediately halt all current research projects and fully commit to developing a Personal Space Ecosystem." Kuang Tianqing, as an advisor to Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, had also come to the Spirit Realm's launch event.

Watching Magnetic Pole introduce each new product, his mind raced. "Is this... something the technology within Kunlun in the Palm could achieve? And in such a short time?"

Recalling the memories in his mind, Kuang Tianqing felt uncertain. "Did Magnetic Pole figure this out and create it herself?"

"Or... did Zhang Yu awaken more of his memories and help Magnetic Pole reach this point?"

Based on various clues, Kuang Tianqing had already concluded that Zhang Yu, like Dao Qiankun, possessed the memories of an Immortal.

Now, his gaze turned to Zhang Yu, who was also attending the launch event. He grew even more convinced that Zhang Yu had assisted Magnetic Pole in achieving this breakthrough.

"If Zhang Yu is helping Magnetic Pole, then that means... Zhang Yu supports the Ten Greats?"

"Perhaps I should get closer to him."

"After all, if he rises to prominence in the future, I might be able to leverage his influence to return to the sect more quickly."

Just then, Kuang Tianqing received a message from Divine Monarch Sinful Lotus, urging her to return to work immediately.

Kuang Tianqing replied: I want to spend more time with Zhang Yu.

Kuang Tianqing: He's a disciple of Magnetic Pole and works at the Research Association. Maintaining contact with him might yield valuable intelligence about Magnetic Pole and their plans.

With that, Kuang Tianqing's Spirit Realm projection advanced, seeking to approach Zhang Yu and find an opportunity to strike up a conversation.

But the next moment, a notification appeared before her:

"Nascent Soul Domain ahead. Entry prohibited for Golden Core Realm cultivators."

"Pay Spirit Coins to enter the Nascent Soul Domain?"

Kuang Tianqing's expression darkened. After glancing at the fee schedule, she silently retreated a step, thinking, "No need to waste money."

She then began sending messages to Zhang Yu.

Netherworld University.

In a laboratory, a massive container was shrinking cargo piece by piece and storing it within.

The onlookers cheered.

Wang Yin, as an assistant, stood among the cheering crowd, thinking, "All the tests have been successful. I heard many companies have already placed orders."

"Once this product hits the market, it will likely completely reshape the transportation industry."

Just then, someone said, "Myriad Laws' press conference has started."

A projection screen materialized in the laboratory, and everyone began watching the broadcast.

As Magnetic Pole explained, the initially joyous atmosphere in the laboratory gradually dissipated. Wang Yin grew increasingly alarmed as he watched.

"Great Void Cloud Repository? Personal Space?"

When he saw the Great Void Cloud Repository being applied to Flying Boats, Wang Yin's heart sank. This directly conflicted with their product.

Seeing how the Great Void Cloud Repository could accommodate various Space services, Wang Yin knew they had already been defeated. Though their product hadn't even launched, it had already failed.

A projection of Divine Monarch Nether Spring suddenly appeared, addressing the crowd: "You've all seen Myriad Laws' press conference, haven't you?"

"Everyone, the gap between us and Magnetic Pole is vast."

Seeing the group's dejected expressions, Divine Monarch Nether Spring encouraged them, "But it's not too late. Your efforts these past months haven't been in vain. You've accumulated a wealth of experience in spatial technology."

"The university will now invest heavily in creating a Personal Space Ecosystem for Netherworld University..."

After boosting their spirits, Divine Monarch Nether Spring felt immense pressure.

"Magnetic Pole has already started selling their products, while we're still designing ours from scratch..."

She could almost see the market being devoured by Magnetic Pole's aggressive expansion, especially during wartime. The demand for spatial products and the drive for technological innovation would inevitably far exceed Kunxu's peacetime levels.

"We must act swiftly. Every minute, every second from now on will determine the future landscape of the Personal Space market."

With mental encouragement, material rewards, and threats to their future prospects, Divine Monarch Nether Spring assigned tasks to the laboratory team and began pushing product development with full force. At the same time, a sliver of her consciousness reached out to Wang Yin.

Divine Monarch Nether Spring: "Go make contact with Zhang Yu."

Wang Yin was slightly taken aback. "Zhang Yu? He's just using the Research Association's funding for his cultivation, isn't he? Why would I need to contact him?"

Divine Monarch Nether Spring: "This shows how much Magnetic Pole values him."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring: "Interact with him more often. You might be able to extract more information about Magnetic Pole from him."

Wang Yin couldn't help but say, "I'm only at the Golden Core stage, while he's at the Nascent Soul stage... I'm afraid he won't even acknowledge me."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring: "Then sacrifice your dignity."

Divine Monarch Nether Spring: "Believe in yourself. You're my son and Zhang Yu's former rival. Your dignity is worth a fortune. You'll definitely get a good price for it from Zhang Yu."

Wang Yin sighed inwardly. Alas, Mother is far inferior to Magnetic Pole. Zhang Yu's Immortal Dao Potential has already surpassed mine without me even realizing it.

After the day's press conference concluded, even more attention focused on Magnetic Pole. Soul Transformation experts from various schools designated monitoring Magnetic Pole and gathering intelligence on her as a long-term priority.

As Magnetic Pole's disciple, Zhang Yu also came under significant scrutiny. Cultivators both familiar and unfamiliar, acting on the instructions of various parties, proactively approached him.

Immortal Armaments University.

Although Tian Shengong had broken through to the Golden Core Realm over a year ago, within this elite research group, he was still considered one of the most junior members.

Despite this, Tian Shengong felt incredibly fulfilled. Every day here was a learning opportunity, and he could sense his own progress.

In particular, the products recently released by the various universities were sent to their laboratory on the first day of release for analysis and reverse engineering.

Each successful breakthrough reinforced Tian Shengong's awe of the university's capabilities.

"Our research on Spatial Technology at Immortal Armaments University must be among the most advanced of the Ten Universities."

The only downside was the research group's strict isolation. Contact with the outside world was forbidden without special authorization, leaving Tian Shengong feeling like he had so much to say but no one to share it with.

Just then, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets' projection materialized, his expression grim as he addressed the group: "I have an announcement. Effective immediately, our research focus is shifting..."

Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets had believed he was fully prepared for the market clash with other schools. He had relentlessly copied their products, driven down costs by exploiting factories, workers, and suppliers, and squeezed every last drop of profit from the supply chain.

But Magnetic Pole's recent product launch caught him completely off guard, rendering his previous efforts almost worthless and inflicting massive losses.

The thought of Magnetic Pole already seizing market share only fueled his anxiety.

"She's at least one to two months ahead of us," he muttered, his voice tight with frustration.

The Tian Shengong artisans below sensed Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets' displeasure. Seated in the laboratory like a giant dragon, his oppressive aura made it feel as if the air itself were thinning, suffocating the entire research team. The atmosphere in the laboratory grew suffocatingly tense.

A day later, Tian Shengong finally understood the reason for Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets' urgency.

A magical artifact bag called Great Void Cloud Repository was delivered to their laboratory, reportedly the latest product developed by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

"It can store up to 500 cubic meters? How is that even possible?"

"This Scaling Space is deformable? It's like several Spatial Magical Artifacts combined into one!"

"Maintaining the stability of the Scaling Space while keeping all interfaces open? Unbelievable..."

As the crowd marveled, Divine Monarch Thousand Puppets' expression grew darker. "Enough chatter," he snapped. "Focus on cracking this thing. No matter how impressive Myriad Laws' product is, we can create something even better."

He rallied them again: "Fellow researchers, you're participating in a world-class project, a chance to reshape the world. If we succeed, your futures will be limitless, your names will shine in the annals of this industry..."

Tian Shengong thought to himself, "The Divine Monarch said the same thing last time."

---

As schools and companies across the realms reacted to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's announcement, the Great Void Cloud Repository also triggered a massive response in the market.

Vast numbers of Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators placed orders almost immediately.

The flagship store in the Spirit Realm sold out within just over two hours of opening.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had to repeatedly urge the factory to expand, even joining forces with Divine Monarch Greenwood to accelerate construction using their immense Soul Transformation Divine Monarch magic power.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's construction company, having prepared in advance, secured numerous Intelligent Construction Space projects.

Watching all this unfold, Zhang Yu secretly breathed a sigh of relief. "It seems we've succeeded."

"However, the current Great Void Cloud Repository is only affordable for Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators."

"In the future, we'll need to compress costs further to release a simplified version that Foundation Establishment cultivators can afford."

At the same time, more and more information began to surface within Zhang Yu's bionic eye.

Zhao Tianxing: President Zhang! Congratulations on the company's explosive growth!

Zhao Tianxing felt genuinely happy seeing the company's business surge again. He knew that after each performance boost, Zhang Yu would never hoard the glory but would genuinely give everyone a raise.

Ying Xin: President Zhang, we're running out of manpower. Should we hire another batch of new employees?

Shi Huaiyu: President Zhang! When are we going public? I think our company is ready for an IPO!

Yan Qianji: True Monarch, I want to return to the Research Association and work under you. I don't even need a salary; I'm willing to pay to work here.

Yu Xinghan: Zhang Yu, are we really going to be rich this time? It feels like a dream.

Bai Zhenzhen: Yu Zi, I bought the Great Void Cloud Repository too! Your teacher is amazing. I think this thing will become as essential as the Bionic Eye in the future.

After replying to everyone, Zhang Yu noticed Bai Zhenzhen's message and replied: A-Zhen, find some time to visit the research institute at the Grand Void.

Zhang Yu: It's been a long time since we last met.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "I can put my current tasks on hold for now. This is the perfect opportunity to help A-Zhen upgrade her Dao Seed."

At that moment, Zhang Yu noticed messages from people he hadn't heard from in ages.

Kuang Tianqing: True Monarch Zhang, after our hurried farewell at the Ten Greats League, I never imagined you'd soar to such heights.

Kuang Tianqing: Back then, I was constrained by the Old Soul Transformation Experts from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools and had to speak harshly. But in my heart, I've always deeply admired you.

Wang Yin: True Monarch, I was foolish on the First Layer. I'm here to apologize.

Wang Yin: If you have time recently, I'd like to express my sincere apologies in person. [100 Spirit Coins]

As Zhang Yu read these messages, he couldn't help but feel a wave of emotion. "In Kunxu, not only does your treatment change when you become stronger, but the environment itself transforms when you help your Teacher grow stronger."

Just as the Great Void Cloud Repository's emergence sent shockwaves through the Ten Great Universities, the Righteous Qi Alliance's powerhouses in the Dark Spirit Realm were also discussing the matter.

Joy God said, "If the Ten Great Universities begin large-scale adoption of the Great Void Cloud Repository, the war situation will turn against us."

"Once the user base expands and various spatial applications develop, this thing will gradually perfect its functions in transportation, storage, defense, mobility... It's a comprehensive revolution!"

An Evil God called Delight God pondered, "This is a groundbreaking product. Why, despite our massive investments in Spatial Technology, haven't we created something like this?"

The assembled Evil Gods turned their gazes toward the former Finance Department cultivators from the Ten Great Universities.

The long-resurrected Divine Monarch Chain Nexus coldly stated, "I purchased and examined the Great Void Cloud Repository that Magnetic Pole created, and had my subordinates inspect it thoroughly."

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus solemnly declared, "Some of its technologies bear similarities to the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier. I suspect someone has leaked our technical intelligence."

"I propose a thorough investigation of the entire Righteous Qi Alliance to prevent any further technology leaks."

Divine Monarch Treasure Flow, whose Spatial Lockdown had been breached by the World-Piercing Cone during his battle with Divine Monarch Greenwood, remarked, "Joy God, if Magnetic Pole hadn't proactively held a press conference, would we ever have discovered what she's been up to? I must say, your Evil God intelligence operations seem rather lacking."

Joy God retorted coldly, "Hmph, are you suggesting someone leaked our technology to Magnetic Pole, enabling them to develop this game-changing product?"

As the two sides began to argue heatedly, Herald God declared loudly, "Everyone, now is not the time to debate who's right or wrong."

"While the Great Void Cloud Repository will strengthen the Ten Great Universities, it's still far from closing the gap between them and us. The battlefield remains under our control."

"However, it's clear our internal security systems need upgrading, and we must intensify our infiltration efforts within Magnetic Pole's organization."

Following the meeting, a comprehensive search of the entire Righteous Qi Alliance was launched.

Simultaneously, the bounties for missions related to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole skyrocketed, and those concerning Zhang Yu also surged dramatically.

Auspicious God received a message from Herald God.

Herald God: Auspicious God, you've been keeping a close eye on Zhang Yu, haven't you?

Herald God: The Alliance Leader has always wanted to recruit Zhang Yu into the Righteous Qi Alliance. Since Zhang Yu is a disciple of Magnetic Pole, he must know a great deal about their inner workings.

Herald God: Do you have any methods to infiltrate Zhang Yu's inner circle?

After this exchange, Auspicious God immediately felt that his long-standing efforts were finally being recognized.

Auspicious God replied promptly: It's been said that Zhang Yu is a sentimental person. His care for his classmates and fellow villagers, as well as his recent rescue of Le Mulan, certainly support this.

Auspicious God: According to my current intelligence, he has an extremely close relationship with Bai Zhenzhen of Heavenly Sword University.

Auspicious God: However, Bai Zhenzhen is skilled at concealing her tracks and has remained elusive. I've only recently uncovered some leads.

Auspicious God: If we can convert Bai Zhenzhen into a believer, we'll have a chance to convert Zhang Yu as well. This would not only fulfill the Alliance Leader's orders but also plant a thorn in Magnetic Pole's side.

Herald God: Excellent. Tell me what you need, and I'll provide my full support.

Auspicious God: Isn't Fortune God very familiar with Myriad Laws University? I haven't been able to reach him lately. Could you ask him to assist me with this matter?
