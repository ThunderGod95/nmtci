# Chapter 719: The Massacre Plan

Seeing Zhang Yu's hesitation, Fu Xiantian frowned slightly and said, "What's wrong? Are you worried that after cultivating this black art, I'll use it as leverage to threaten you?"

"If so, you underestimate me, Fu Xiantian, far too much."

Zhang Yu chuckled awkwardly, admitting to himself that he hadn't even considered that possibility.

The main reason for his hesitation was that the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture before him only contained the Level 1 entry-level content, making it an incomplete cultivation art.

"It's like this," Zhang Yu explained, looking at Fu Xiantian. "I have a habit of not cultivating incomplete cultivation arts."

"Since you've already come all this way and given me this much, why not just give me the complete version of the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture?"

Fu Xiantian remained silent, his gaze fixed on Zhang Yu. Under that intense stare, Zhang Yu chuckled awkwardly again and said, "Never mind then."

Fu Xiantian said calmly, "If you're willing to join the Righteous Qi Alliance, we'll become allies. I'll share all the cultivation arts I possess with you, whether they're military-grade techniques or Immortal Sect Techniques."

"But for now, I can only teach you Level 1 techniques."

Zhang Yu reread the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture and realized it was indeed quite complex.

"Requires establishing ritualistic altars to refine Reincarnation Force, aligning with the will of Heaven... ultimately connecting with the Heavenly Dao Reincarnation in the unseen realm..."

The more Zhang Yu studied this brief introductory section, the more he marveled at its profound mysteries, which touched upon the deepest secrets of Kunxu Heaven and Earth.

Awakened past-life memories weren't unlocked from one's own mind but rather gleaned through enlightenment from the Heavenly Dao Reincarnation itself.

This was the first step in the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture's manipulation of the Heavenly Dao Reincarnation, the foundational cornerstone of this cultivation art.

Even from this introductory section alone, Zhang Yu secretly mused that Fu Xiantian, Ying Xintian, and their ilk might genuinely possess the power to manipulate Reincarnation, reincarnating individuals from the Second to Fifth Layers into their so-called New World.

At the same time, a question arose in his mind.

Zhang Yu closed the document on the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture within his Bionic Eye and spoke, "I have a question."

Fu Xiantian asked, "Why don't you cultivate for a while first to verify the art's correctness?"

Zhang Yu glanced at the blank space where the Feather Book should have displayed the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture, realizing it was still holding him back.

Fortunately, Zhang Yu's own foundation allowed him to recognize the extraordinary value of the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture.

Zhang Yu said calmly, "No need. After contemplating it just now, I've nearly grasped the essence of this cultivation art. I believe you truly possess the technology to manipulate Reincarnation."

Fu Xiantian nodded slightly, thinking to himself that Zhang Yu truly deserved the Master's favor. His aptitude for the Immortal Dao was indeed among the very best.

"But a problem arises," Zhang Yu continued. "You said that those who die in the Second to Fifth Layers will be reborn in the New World."

"Will they awaken memories of their previous lives after reincarnation?"

Fu Xiantian replied firmly, "Of course not."

"The Reincarnation System in the New World will operate entirely naturally, without any human interference whatsoever."

"As for awakening innate wisdom? Absolutely not."

"If innate wisdom could be awakened, what would be the point of our 1500 year lifespan limit? If innate wisdom could be awakened, wouldn't the New World simply become another realm dominated by immortal old monsters, generation after generation, exploiting the world and leaving it stagnant, decaying, and foul-smelling?"

"Therefore, in the future New World, no being, regardless of their nature, who undergoes reincarnation will retain memories of their previous life."

Fu Xiantian stated firmly, "This rule applies to all beings in the Second to Fifth Layers, to my Master, to myself, and to you. None of us can violate it. We will journey to the New World, live out our natural lifespans there, and upon death, be reborn without any recollection of our past lives."

Though Zhang Yu had already suspected this, hearing it confirmed still shocked him.

But what Fu Xiantian said next sent a chill down Zhang Yu's spine.

"The Second to Fifth Layers are now deeply corrupted by Demonic Roots," Fu Xiantian continued. "The rot is irreversible."

"Without drastic measures, this poison will spread endlessly. Even if we migrate to the New World, the inertia of Kunxu will drag us forward along the same destructive path."

"Now, through reincarnation and the absence of innate wisdom, we have the perfect opportunity for a cleansing."

Staring intently at Zhang Yu, Fu Xiantian spoke each word with deliberate weight: "Every single being in the Second to Fifth Layers must be reborn in the New World, starting anew and completely shedding the lingering poison of Kunxu."

Zhang Yu's body stiffened at the words, and he stared at Fu Xiantian in disbelief. "You want to kill them all? Kill everyone on the Second to Fifth Layers?"

Fu Xiantian frowned. "They won't die. They'll simply begin anew."

Zhang Yu glared at Fu Xiantian, his voice rising in anger. "If they won't even retain their memories after reincarnation in the New World, what's the difference between that and death?"

Fu Xiantian waved his hand dismissively. "How can you say there's no difference?"

"Perhaps they won't remember, perhaps they won't know, perhaps they won't understand, but you and I will know, you and I will understand. They'll have escaped Kunxu, escaped the endless cycles of suffering, poverty, and exploitation that have defined their existence."

Zhang Yu frowned. "But... without their memories, without any trace of their existence in this world, without any connection to their past lives, the New World will be utterly meaningless to them."

The thought of his Teacher, his comrades, his classmates, his fellow villagers... all being slaughtered by Fu Xiantian and sent into Reincarnation was unbearable.

Fu Xiantian said, "How many people remember their lives before the age of three? How many recall their time in the womb? Does the inability to remember mean they died once as infants?"

He looked at Zhang Yu and continued, "Memory is neither a prerequisite nor proof of life. It is merely an asset. If you lack the resolve to discard this asset, how can you forge a New World?"

Zhang Yu countered, "Memory constitutes our entire past — our personality, our beliefs, the very foundation of who we are. If not only our physical bodies but also our memories are to be completely discarded, what connection will the future reincarnated self have to the person we are now?"

"Isn't this just slaughtering the people of one world to create the people of another?"

Fu Xiantian replied coldly, "Indeed. If you wish to see it that way, you may. You can believe we are slaughtering the people of one world to create a New World. This is sacrifice — sacrificing the past of heaven, earth, and all living beings to secure their future."

"As I've said before, change always comes with sacrifice. Did you think it would be a win-win-win scenario where everyone benefits?"

"Sacrificing their past for the benefit of their future is already the best solution..."

Seeing Zhang Yu's continued resistance, Fu Xiantian sighed. "Zhang Yu, you can't possibly believe that by joining the Righteous Qi Alliance and aligning with us, your companions — Bai Zhenzhen, Yu Xinghan, Le Mulan, and all the others — will safely reach the New World, can you?"

"If that were the case, what about your teachers? Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood? Should I spare them too?"

Zhang Yu stared at Fu Xiantian without a word.

Fu Xiantian continued, "And what about your classmates? Ying Xin, Shi Huaiyu, Feng Tingting, and so on, and so on."

"And your fellow villagers? Zhao Tianxing, Mo Tianyi, Shi Yunxiang... You don't want them to die either, do you?"

"And what about your teachers' disciples, your classmates' classmates, your fellow villagers' fellow villagers? Don't they all want to survive?"

"If we keep going down this path, will we end up saving even the mounts beneath their asses?"

"Fine, let's say they all follow you to the New World, carrying their memories of Kunxu. What will they be to those who have no such memories?"

"They will become the new Heavenly Court, the new sects, the new Immortals."

Fu Xiantian strode toward Zhang Yu, his intense battle intent radiating from every pore, carrying a will to defy heaven and earth and shatter all opposition.

Under the crushing pressure of this will, Zhang Yu felt the Spirit Realm around him sever completely. All magical artifacts and Bionics seemed to freeze, and video and audio recording became impossible.

From some unknown moment, Fu Xiantian's words began transmitting directly into Zhang Yu's mind, bypassing sound and conventional Spirit Realm signals.

Zhang Yu's heart tightened. He realized that Fu Xiantian's dao heart and mental cultivation technique had reached a level where they could influence reality through the Spirit Realm's information network.

"Zhang Yu," Fu Xiantian glared at him, "we are creating a New World, a new Reincarnation, not to bring our own people or establish a new Kunxu there."

"If that were our goal, why would we abandon the resources of sects and Immortals?"

"My Master and I can obtain everything here — everything beyond your wildest imagination."

At this point, Fu Xiantian turned to Zhang Yu, a hint of disdain flickering in his eyes. "If we were to let you join us, allowing you to lead everyone to the New World and become Immortals there, it would prove our vision is no greater than this. What's the point of creating a New World then?"

Zhang Yu took a deep breath. "I will never agree to this plan of slaughter. Must you kill everyone? Why can't we bring them all to the New World and change them gradually, year by year, generation by generation?"

"Do you think we haven't tried that?" Fu Xiantian said coldly. "As long as the Heavenly Court, the sects, the Immortals... as long as these remain in their memories, as long as they still believe these are the ultimate powers, the strongest forces in the world, nothing will ever change."

"Or do you think we should first defeat the Heavenly Court, crush the sects, and vanquish the Immortals?" Fu Xiantian sighed. "Those who once harbored such thoughts have long since had their souls scattered and spirits extinguished. Anyone who still believes such things now... can only be described as naive, arrogant, and ignorant."

"These people have no idea how high the steps of the Heavenly Court are, nor how profound the cultivation of the Immortals is."

"They know nothing, yet they spout grand pronouncements, arrogantly believing they can perfectly resolve everything..."

With that, Fu Xiantian turned his gaze back to Zhang Yu. "I came here to see if you are worthy to walk the same path as me."

Fu Xiantian stared intently at Zhang Yu, as if trying to see through him completely, and asked, each word deliberate: "Zhang Yu, I ask you again: are you willing to join me in annihilating all living beings and creating a New World?"

Zhang Yu met Fu Xiantian's gaze without flinching, his voice unwavering: "Fu Xiantian, I will never let you slaughter everyone."

Fu Xiantian shook his head, his figure gradually fading away.

"It seems you ultimately lack the capacity to forge a New World."

"But for Master's sake, I will give you one last chance."

As Fu Xiantian's figure completely vanished, only his words lingered in Zhang Yu's mind:

"When I have annihilated all the Soul Transformation Experts from the Ten Universities, if you still stubbornly resist... I will act in Master's stead and execute you as well."

"I will personally send you to the New World."
