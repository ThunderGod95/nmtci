# Chapter 627: Funeral

Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture Level 11 (0/110)

As Zhang Yu circulated his Magic Power, he saw two strands of hair fall from his head. In mid-air, they twisted and transformed, eventually taking the shape of two swimming fish.

Simultaneously, moisture in the air rapidly condensed under the influence of the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor, forming a sphere of water that coalesced in mid-air to catch the transformed fish.

As the fish darted through the water, Zhang Yu felt the water's temperature, currents, texture, and visual information as if the fish were extensions of his own body, allowing him to manipulate them at will, extending his senses into the water.

"Finally reached Level 11 before the finals."

"I wonder what kind of battle strategy the finals will require."

Reaching Level 11 of the Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture did not disappoint Zhang Yu. After a brief experiment, he immediately recognized its immense utility.

If asked to describe its usefulness, Zhang Yu might say... it was like being able to summon people from Earth: North Africans, East Africans, West Africans, South Africans, West Coasters, East Coasters — each with extraordinary physical prowess and specialized skills in singing, dancing, rapping, shopping, and more. Each one could stand alone and generate profit for Zhang Yu.

"I hope I'll have the opportunity and time to further improve my strength during the finals."

"Ah, if only I had another six months... no, even just three more months, my chances of winning the championship would be vastly different."

Zhang Yu shook his head sharply, dismissing these distracting thoughts. "Now's not the time for such musings. Regardless, I'll give it my all to seize this Immortal Sect Technique."

As Zhang Yu began inventorying his magical artifacts, organizing his sword casket, and making final preparations, two Patrol Team Members located him through the Spirit Realm Projection and requested to ask him some questions.

Zhang Yu glanced at them in surprise, finding their sudden appearance rather inexplicable.

He frowned slightly and said, "Gentlemen, I'm scheduled to participate in the Ten Greats League soon. I'm afraid I won't have time to cooperate with you."

As he spoke, Zhang Yu deliberately displayed his ranking, hoping they would take the hint and withdraw.

The two Patrol Team Members maintained their polite demeanor. One of them said, "Student Yu, please rest assured, this won't interfere with your participation in the Ten Greats League."

"Because the Ten Greats League has been postponed."

Zhang Yu froze, staring at them in disbelief. "What did you say? The Ten Greats League has been postponed?"

The Patrol Team Member nodded. "The exact postponement date hasn't been set yet, but it definitely won't be today."

Zhang Yu immediately messaged True Monarch Tranquility. He received confirmation and was also asked if anyone had come to question him.

True Monarch Tranquility: Cooperate fully, don't be nervous, just answer truthfully.

Zhang Yu's mind was in turmoil, flooded with questions. "What exactly happened? Why would they postpone the Ten Greats League?!"

He turned to the two Patrol Team Members. "Gentlemen, is something major going on?"

The Patrol Team Members exchanged wry smiles and shook their heads. "Student Yu, please don't put us in a difficult position. Violating regulations by leaking information would land us in serious debt."

Zhang Yu nodded. "Alright, then ask whatever you need to. I'll cooperate as best I can."

Patrol Team Member: Student Yu, where did you go yesterday?

"Are there any witnesses?"

"What's your opinion of Dao Qiankun?"

"What did you discuss with Dao Qiankun yesterday?"

After a series of routine questions, Zhang Yu noticed the questioning increasingly focused on Dao Qiankun, planting a troubling thought in his mind.

After the interrogation concluded and the projections of the two Patrol Team Members vanished, Zhang Yu immediately sent a message to Dao Qiankun, but received no response.

To his surprise, Zhang Yu discovered that "Brother Dao has gone offline?"

He tried asking others, but most were either as clueless as he was or remained silent, as if under a gag order.

The entire Myriad Laws University campus spent the day in a state of nervous anticipation.

Meanwhile, the news of the Ten Greats League's postponement stirred up a maelstrom of speculation in the Spirit Realm.

Some claimed there had been a bloody clash among Soul Transformation cultivators, others that the Heavenly Court had ordered a change in the competition format, and still others that an Evil Cult attack had resulted in player casualties. The rumors were endless, fueling fears of another economic crisis and causing fluctuations in stock prices, cryptocurrency values, and commodity prices.

Amid this widespread panic, Myriad Laws University officially released a statement the following day.

"Brother Dao is dead?"

Zhang Yu stared at the announcement in disbelief.

"How is that possible?"

As he continued reading the investigation results, his shock deepened. "Suicide?"

"Bewitched by the Ascension Sect?"

"Soul scattered and spirit extinguished..."

Zhang Yu's mind flashed back to his last meeting with Dao Qiankun that night. He could almost hear the man's words echoing in his ears.

"If you encounter danger you can't handle, flee."

"Preserve your useful lives. Don't sacrifice yourselves lightly."

"You can also flee behind me. I will do my best to protect you."

---

Zhang Yu took a deep breath. "How could Brother Dao have committed suicide? And how could he have joined the Ascension Sect?"

He refused to believe the investigation's conclusion, sensing layers of hidden agendas and unknown depths.

Remembering Dao Qiankun's disagreements with the Soul Transformation experts, Zhang Yu felt an unsettling suspicion rise in his heart: "Could the Soul Transformation experts be behind this? The Soul Transformation experts from the Four Myriad Laws Schools... Did they kill Brother Dao because of their conflicts?"

Just then, Lady Fortune's voice echoed in Zhang Yu's mind: "I don't necessarily think the Soul Transformation experts from the Four Myriad Laws Schools were responsible."

"Lady Fortune?" Zhang Yu exclaimed, surprised. "You're awake?"

Due to the intense scrutiny of the Ten Greats League and the watchful eyes of numerous Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, Lady Fortune had remained in a dormant state since arriving at the arena to avoid drawing unnecessary attention.

Hearing Zhang Yu's words, Lady Fortune replied, "Your emotions are too turbulent. You've been disturbing my slumber for quite some time."

"Let's get back to the matter of Dao Qiankun."

"Even if the Soul Transformation experts from the Four Myriad Laws Schools couldn't reach an agreement with him, Dao Qiankun would still be a valuable bargaining chip. Whether negotiating with Vajra, Immortal Soldiers, Heavenly Sword, or the Four Heavenly Demon Schools, Dao Qiankun's potential to win the championship made him crucial."

"Who did this?" Zhang Yu asked. "It can't really be suicide induced by the Ascension Sect's bewitchment, right?"

Lady Fortune sighed. "We don't know who did it, but to accomplish this right outside the Ten Greats League arena, under layers of restrictions and the watchful eyes of Soul Transformation experts, the perpetrator's strength must be extraordinary."

As news of Dao Qiankun's death spread, Zhang Yu quickly noticed the Spirit Realm erupting into chaos.

Setting aside the wild rumors and speculation, the most discussed topic was Kuang Tianqing's impending victory in the Ten Greats League.

Many believed that with Dao Qiankun gone, Kuang Tianqing had no rivals left in the competition. Securing the championship and claiming the Immortal Sect Technique seemed inevitable.

Consequently, Heavenly Demon University was now seen as a future powerhouse poised to benefit from Immortal Dao Technology, brimming with potential and investment opportunities. Its stock prices and currency values surged across the board.

The allied factions of Joyous Union, Netherworld, and White Bone also experienced significant gains.

Meanwhile, Myriad Laws University, having lost Dao Qiankun, saw its related stock prices plummet, dragging down the values of Immortal Soldiers, Vajra, and Heavenly Sword as well.

As public opinion outside grew increasingly turbulent, like a raging storm gathering momentum, a funeral was being held within the grounds of Myriad Laws University.

Zhang Yu quietly observed Dao Qiankun, who sat cross-legged on the platform, eyes closed and a serene smile on his face. His complexion was unnaturally rosy for a deceased person.

Simultaneously, messages from Ye Xingli appeared in his Bionic Eye.

Ye Xingli: I heard they found no injuries on Brother Dao's body.

Ye Xingli: There were no signs of a struggle at the scene.

Ye Xingli: They say his physical death was natural.

Zhang Yu: What about the Spirit Realm? Didn't any Righteous God claim Brother Dao's soul?

Ye Xingli: I don't know, but if they had, Brother Dao would have been resurrected by now.

At that moment, a representative from Dao Qiankun's clan stepped forward to deliver a eulogy, recounting Dao Qiankun's outstanding academic achievements, impressive work history, and exceptional Immortal Dao Potential.

Following him, the director of the Dao Techniques Department took the stage to speak, followed by Nine Heavens Liu, who delivered a speech as the student representative.

Brother Dao's various awards, cultivation achievements, and exceptional physical body data were projected one by one, showcasing his outstanding talent and extraordinary excellence from every angle.

With the speeches and presentations concluded, the main event of the funeral began.

"We will now commence the first auction item: the right arm."

"Starting bid: 30 Spirit Coins. Minimum bid increment: 10 Spirit Coins."

Yan Qianji raised his hand and declared, "50 Spirit Coins!"

Nine Heavens Liu countered, "60 Spirit Coins."

Watching the funeral attendees, their eyes burning with avarice as they stared at Dao Qiankun's corpse and began bidding, Zhang Yu felt like he was witnessing a pack of hyenas tearing apart the carcass of a lion.

He muttered to himself, "So this is how the wealthy in Kunxu hold funerals?"

Unlike ordinary people who held memorial recruitment gatherings in the Spirit Realm after death, the corpses of the wealthy — especially renowned figures like Dao Qiankun — often commanded exorbitant prices. These bodies were auctioned off at memorial auctions, with the proceeds divided among the family and sect to partially compensate for the loss of their member.

The higher the auction price at the funeral, the greater the honor bestowed upon the deceased.

"To the wealthy, a corpse is just another garment," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "Though I disapprove, for the Kunxu People, it's probably no different from selling a celebrity's personal belongings after their death, right?"

Just as the bidding grew increasingly fierce, a piercing female voice cut through the crowd, silencing the hall.

"I bid 500 Spirit Coins."

All heads snapped up to see Kuang Tianqing standing against the wall, arms crossed, her gaze fixed calmly on Dao Qiankun on the stage.

Meeting the crowd's stares, Kuang Tianqing grinned, her expression defiant. "I'm claiming his corpse today. Don't even think about bidding against me, got it?"

Li Shiwei shot to her feet, her voice ringing with fury. "Kuang Tianqing! You're the one who killed Brother Dao! You were too cowardly to face him in the arena! You ambushed him, and now you want to desecrate his corpse?!"

"You think you can buy him out for that price?" she spat. "I won't let you insult Brother Dao like this!"
