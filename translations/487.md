# Chapter 487: She's Different

Feng Yuhuan's voice grew more forceful with each word, his gaze piercing as he stared down True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

At that moment, Director Gao stepped forward. "Teacher Feng, this project isn't just about the Artifact Refinement Department. Zhang Yu is one of our Civil Engineering Department's top students. To ensure his success in the competition, our department will provide full support. We won't allow him to be humiliated on the field."

As he spoke, Director Gao moved to stand beside True Monarch Magnetic Pole.

"Gao Chongguang, you're truly willing to go all in," Feng Yuhuan said slowly, his eyes fixed on the pair. "What kind of enchantment has Magnetic Pole cast on you? Aren't you afraid of losing everything?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "The Civil Engineering and Artifact Refinement Departments have always collaborated. For example, Feng Tingting from our department transferred to Civil Engineering to pursue a dual degree. She can assist the Civil Engineering team in the competition. In the future, our departments will expand our cooperation even further."

Director Gao said calmly, "Our Civil Engineering Department also has Mo Shangjin, who has mastered the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. Once his injuries heal, he can immediately join the competition to support Zhang Yu and ensure his safety."

Feng Yuhuan frowned. "Even with all you've said, how can you guarantee that Immortal Armaments University and Celestial Monsters University won't escalate their efforts?"

"Ultimately, risking increased costs... it's simply unnecessary. No matter how much you reduce the risks, it's still safer to keep Zhang Yu quietly in University City."

"The best place for him is the laboratory. Only there can we ensure he remains untainted by outsiders."

Just as the stalemate seemed unbreakable, Zhang Yu spoke up: "Teachers, I have an idea that should guarantee my safety on the field."

Feng Yuhuan shot him a cold glance, about to retort, "The teachers are discussing this. What does a student like you know?"

As for Zhang Yu proving his combat capabilities, Feng Yuhuan saw no point.

How strong would be strong enough? What level of combat and construction skills could guarantee Zhang Yu wouldn't be corrupted on the competition stage?

Feng Yuhuan believed Zhang Yu could prove nothing and guarantee nothing.

But Zhang Yu said, "I can surrender."

Feng Yuhuan was slightly taken aback.

Zhang Yu continued, "I surrender extremely quickly. The moment I sense something is wrong, I'll surrender immediately. Even if we lose the match, I'll never give the opponent a chance to humiliate me."

With genuine sincerity, Zhang Yu said, "I understand that preventing the opponent from humiliating me is far more important than winning or losing the match."

Director Gao chimed in, "During the match against Vajra University, Zhang Yu led the surrender and was the first to flee the arena. This student has shown remarkable responsibility and decisiveness in such situations."

Just then, Zhang Yu's Foundation Establishment Domain activated, displaying a message before everyone: "Foundation Establishment cultivator Zhang Yu has decided to cease hostilities and withdraw from the competition. Cease all attacks immediately, or face the consequences."

Zhang Yu explained, "This is a Foundation Establishment Domain I commissioned. The control can be handed over to Teacher Gao. If Teacher Gao senses any danger, he can activate the domain at any time, forcing my immediate withdrawal from the match."

"Even if I withdraw from the competition and the opponent still tries to attack, the referee can intervene, and the teachers can arrive to support me."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said calmly, "I will monitor the competition venue and can protect Zhang Yu at any time. No additional funding is required."

Director Gao added, "And I'll be there too. With both of us present, there should be no risk on the competition floor, right, Teacher Feng?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "The same principle applies outside the venue. As long as we maintain strict confidentiality of Zhang Yu's information and ensure stable communication channels, allowing us to provide immediate support, there will be no risk."

"Moreover, these measures won't be costly, yet the benefits are substantial: promoting our project's achievements, boosting stock prices, and potentially securing the design blueprints for Military-Grade Armor."

Seeing Feng Yuhuan frown without responding, Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations chuckled. "See? After all this discussion, we've finally come up with a solution."

"Magnetic Pole, Greenwood, finalize the detailed plan and submit it to the Research Department for review."

"Xiao Feng, the Research Department needs to finalize this quickly. By tomorrow at the latest, get the approval process completed."

"If there are any remaining objections, raise them now. We can't afford any delays."

Feng Yuhuan spoke up: "The proposed method has merit, but if we lose the competition and constantly require support and protection, what promotional value will it have? It might even backfire, damaging the project and dragging down our stock price."

"Moreover, True Monarch Magnetic Pole and True Monarch Greenwood, aren't your working hours supposed to be for the school? Taking time off to support Zhang Yu during work hours will inevitably disrupt your duties and cost the school resources."

"Therefore, I propose that if Zhang Yu surrenders in the next competition, it proves the costs and risks outweigh the benefits. We should then withdraw him from further participation."

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations nodded in agreement. "Xiao Feng's points are valid. Both of you have your own responsibilities and can't constantly watch over Zhang Yu. Let's proceed with this plan."

Under Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations' calm gaze, True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Director Gao both nodded slightly in acknowledgment.

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations then turned to Zhang Yu, smiling slightly. "You're a bright young man. I enjoy speaking with young people, especially intelligent ones, unlike those old fossils who cling to their outdated ways, refusing to adapt and merely waiting for death."

No one dared to continue this line of conversation. After all, the "old fossils" Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations referred to were likely high-level experts at the Soul Transformation realm. While the Divine Monarch could speak freely, the teachers and students present wouldn't dare criticize such figures.

The Divine Monarch sighed. "True Monarch Magnetic Pole and True Monarch Greenwood both advocated for this opportunity for you."

"But remember this: defeat is a minor matter; losing your integrity is a grave offense."

"Now go and do your best. I eagerly await your performance."

After Zhang Yu and the others had left, a cryptic smile appeared on Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations' face.

In a vision only he could see, a series of messages had recently appeared before him via the Spirit Realm Network.

They were from Divine Monarch Seven Emotions of Heavenly Sword University.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions: I'm buying Zhang Yu from your Civil Engineering Department.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions: Name your price.

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations: Don't be absurd. Students aren't my property to buy or sell.

Seeing that Divine Monarch Seven Emotions hadn't replied, Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations smiled faintly. "I'll see how urgent your Extreme Emotion Sword Dao truly is, and how long you can endure."

Just then, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions sent another message.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions: I'm coming for you.

Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations frowned slightly. "Coming for me?"

His gaze flickered, and countless images flashed through his eyes, but he found no signs of movement at either Heavenly Sword University or Myriad Laws University.

The next moment, Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations raised an eyebrow, thinking, "This fellow..."

He looked up at the sky. "Is she referring to her true form on the sixth floor?"

---

On the way out of the 666th floor, True Monarch Magnetic Pole thought to herself, "That Feng Yuhuan kid probably hasn't given up yet. He'll likely try to seize control of this project again."

Just then, Director Gao, walking beside her, remarked, "Magnetic Pole, have you noticed anything strange about the Divine Monarch's tone and the way Feng Yuhuan looked at me today? Sometimes it felt... off."

Zhang Yu's steps faltered slightly, but True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied casually, "Really? Must be your imagination."

Director Gao frowned. "But...?"

"No buts," True Monarch Magnetic Pole interrupted. "Focus on drafting the support plan for Zhang Yu later. He's your student, so you need to get things moving quickly."

She then sent Director Gao a private message: "Have you discussed Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' disciple with Zhang Yu yet?"

Director Gao: "I sent him some news articles."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "I have other matters to attend to later. Take this opportunity to talk to him today and urge him to cut ties as soon as possible."

After True Monarch Magnetic Pole separated them, Director Gao pondered for a moment before speaking. "I heard you're quite close to that new disciple of Divine Monarch Seven Emotions?"

Zhang Yu nodded. "Yes, Bai Zhenzhen was my classmate in high school."

Director Gao slowly continued, recalling the intelligence he had gathered the previous day. "Did you read the news articles I sent you? Divine Monarch Seven Emotions is proficient in many sword techniques, but her most famous are the Seven Emotions Sword Dao and the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"The Seven Emotions Sword Dao allows practitioners to amplify the power of their swordsmanship by channeling the seven emotions."

"The Extreme Emotion Sword Dao is even more extraordinary. It's said to enable one to wield a sword with pure emotion, driving their swordsmanship with extreme feelings."

"The specific principles behind these techniques remain Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' closely guarded secret, unknown to outsiders. However, judging by the experiences of her disciples, this sword art follows a thoroughly Demonic Path. Practitioners have repeatedly killed their spouses, parents, children, and even entire families — not just once or twice..."

Zhang Yu firmly replied, "Bai Zhenzhen and I climbed up from the First Layer together. She's different."

Seeing Zhang Yu's earnest expression, Director Gao shook his head helplessly. "People change. The more money and cultivation power someone has, the faster they change."

Zhang Yu countered, "You've been friends with True Monarch Magnetic Pole for centuries. Has she changed?"

Director Gao replied, "You don't understand. Magnetic Pole is different."

Zhang Yu retorted, "Bai Zhenzhen is different too."

Director Gao thought irritably, "This kid... is he blinded by the prestige of being a Soul Transformation disciple?"

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Old Gao, you can't even outsmart Magnetic Pole yourself. Stop trying to lecture me."

Director Gao persisted, "Aren't you close to Wen Wuya too? He's also a Soul Transformation disciple. You should cultivate with him more and stay away from Bai Zhenzhen."

"They're both Soul Transformation disciples. Isn't Wen Wuya far better than Bai Zhenzhen, who's walking the Demonic Path?"

Zhang Yu remained unconvinced, but seeing Director Gao's growing frustration, he decided to drop the argument.

---

Meanwhile, on the other side, Feng Yuhuan returned to his office and pulled up the student files.

He thought to himself, "That woman, Magnetic Pole, is always buried in her experiments, acting arbitrarily in projects, and obsessed with control."

"All she cares about is her research. How could she possibly understand the difficulties we face in the Research Department?"

"I need to find a way to rein her in. I can't let her continue to act without restraint in critical projects, indulging her whims and acting recklessly."

As he pondered these matters, Feng Yuhuan's gaze swept across the student files, occasionally selecting one.

"The key issue remains that she controls the experimental results."

"If more students react with the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact and produce results, we won't need to worry about a mere Zhang Yu."

With this thought, Feng Yuhuan immediately decided to select more candidates to send to True Monarch Celestial Seal, hoping to expedite the creation of new results.
