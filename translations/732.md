# Chapter 732: Calamity Zhang Yu

Seeing the message from Zhang Yu, Divine Monarch Greenwood smiled and replied, "As long as you're back, that's all that matters."

Zhang Yu: "Teacher, please wait a moment. I will open the great formation as soon as possible."

On the current Nascent Soul Battlefield, with the discovery of the true formation node — or rather, the formation core — the Nascent Soul True Monarchs of the Righteous Qi Alliance and the Ten Universities had all gathered here to engage in the final battle.

Within the formation core, an area no larger than one square kilometer, an unprecedentedly fierce battle erupted.

The reason was simple: whoever controlled the formation core could choose to either shatter or maintain the Cosmic Galaxy Great Formation. They would dictate the outcome of the Soul Transformation Battlefield, shape the future of Kunxu's Second through Fifth Layers, and decide the fate of trillions of living beings.

In this grand final battle that would determine the fortunes of countless individuals, every Nascent Soul True Monarch unleashed their ultimate power, shining with dazzling brilliance on the battlefield.

Yet, even amidst this myriad of lights, one figure's radiance remained blindingly bright, peerless and supreme, eclipsing the sharpness of all others.

True Monarch Immortal Slayer, a Nascent Soul Cultivator of mysterious origins, rampaged across the battlefield, utterly invincible. He pulverized one powerful Nascent Soul after another from the Ten Great Universities, single-handedly dominating the course of the battle.

Under the sweep of his sword's edge, the numerous experts of the Ten Greats retreated step by step. The remaining core forces — such as True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter, True Monarch Miraculous Hand, and True Monarch String Tone — were still engaged in a desperate struggle within the formation core. However, in the eyes of the Righteous Qi Alliance's experts, their efforts were merely the death throes of a cornered beast.

True Monarch Severing Clouds, the traitor of Heavenly Sword, watched this scene and thought to himself, "Once they are eliminated, the entire formation core will be completely occupied by the Righteous Qi Alliance. The Ten Universities will have no chance of turning the tables."

At this thought, True Monarch Severing Clouds felt increasingly fortunate that he had ultimately made the correct choice and successfully defected to the Righteous Qi Alliance.

Meanwhile, the entire formation core was tightly encircled by the Righteous Qi Alliance's numerous experts. Under the sweeping power of one Nascent Soul True Monarch after another, an area extending hundreds of kilometers beyond the formation core had been completely sealed off.

It was at this moment that Zhang Yu arrived at a position 122 kilometers from the formation core. Simultaneously, he sensed his presence being locked onto by a series of magical artifacts.

He had been discovered.

Zhang Yu's gaze swept across the layered battlefield, seemingly traversing the 122-kilometer distance to see True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter and True Monarch String Tone fighting desperately to resist, and True Monarch Immortal Slayer on the verge of victory.

"Senior Sister," Zhang Yu said, "What's the current situation?"

A message from Zhang Pianpian lit up in Zhang Yu's bionic eye: "True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter and the others can hold on for a little longer."

Zhang Pianpian: "If you can break through the Righteous Qi Alliance's encirclement, cross this 122-kilometer distance, defeat everyone in the formation core — especially that True Monarch Immortal Slayer — and prevent any Righteous Qi Alliance experts from entering the formation core for 16 minutes..."

Zhang Pianpian: "If you can accomplish all that, I can help you seize control of the formation core."

Zhang Yu didn't reply. He simply took a deep breath, then stepped forward. His body instantly accelerated, leaving a trail of afterimages as he charged.

Meanwhile, on the outskirts of the battlefield, True Monarch Junior College had already detected Zhang Yu's presence.

As one of the Righteous Qi Alliance's experts, True Monarch Junior College had been stationed on the battlefield's periphery specifically to intercept and block anyone attempting to flee from within or break through from outside to provide reinforcements.

He estimated internally, "It won't be long before the Ten Greats' experts inside start surrendering or fleeing en masse."

Upon discovering Zhang Yu, True Monarch Junior College felt a jolt of surprise.

"Zhang Yu... You barely managed to escape, yet you dare to return here?"

Before his fall, the Joy God had naturally sent out a call for reinforcements. The intelligence that Zhang Yu and his group had escaped had, of course, been seen by True Monarch Junior College.

Though he didn't know how Zhang Yu and the others had managed to escape, seeing Zhang Yu before him now, True Monarch Junior College felt a sense of fortune.

"Then I'll just suppress you again."

He changed his livestream title to "Suppressing True Monarch Blazing Light," poured in traffic packages and recommended slots, and with a light tap of his fingertip, unleashed streaks of incantations.

Simultaneously, True Monarch Junior College sent a message to his side's combat group chat: "Zhang Yu is mine alone. No one interfere!"

In an instant, True Monarch Junior College had adjusted to his optimal combat state.

"Heaven and Earth Record, First Style: Homicide!"

He casually hurled a corpse at Zhang Yu like a meteor. As the corpse shattered with a resounding "thud", a Spirit Realm Projection materialized above Zhang Yu's head — a faint red aura signifying a murderer.

At the same time, a message from Zhang Pianpian lit up in Zhang Yu's eye.

"Zhang Pianpian: It's a Spirit Realm attack. He's pinned a crime on you to trigger the divine power network's subsequent attacks."

"Zhang Pianpian: But I think this might be an opportunity for you, which is why I arranged for you to launch your assault from this direction."

Zhang Yu asked, "What kind of attacks will the divine power network launch?"

After listening to Zhang Pianpian's explanation, Zhang Yu replied, "I understand. You don't need to block the direct attacks for me. You're right — this is indeed a boon, allowing me to drag the battlefield into my most proficient domain."

Zhang Yu: "But as for the fines and such... I'll need you to delay those for me, Senior Sister."

Zhang Pianpian: "Don't worry. Not a single coin will be fined from you."

The moment Zhang Yu and Zhang Pianpian finished their exchange, the divine power network's warning arrived.

"Cultivator True Monarch Blazing Light, you have been detected committing an act of violence against the victim [He Yiyang] at [Crime Scene Coordinates] on [Time of Incident], resulting in the victim's death."

"Your personal account has been flagged. In accordance with # Chapter 3, Article 12 of the Kunxu Basic Law, please cooperate with detention..."

A flood of red warnings continuously popped up, filling Zhang Yu's vision like layers of bandages.

As Zhang Yu continued to advance, ignoring the warnings, wisps of divine power materialized in the air, forming massive hands that lunged to seize him.

*Bang!* *Bang!* *Bang!* *Bang!*

As Zhang Yu shattered one divine power hand after another, the red warnings in his vision grew brighter.

"Violent resistance to law enforcement detected! Violent resistance to law enforcement detected!"

Watching this scene, True Monarch Junior College smiled faintly and unleashed his second move: "Infringement".

True Monarch Junior College chuckled faintly. "Zhang Yu, you've already fallen into the web I've woven. You've stepped into my combat domain."

As packets of infringement data were sent to Zhang Yu, his crimes escalated once more. The four characters "True Monarch Blazing Light" above his head not only deepened in their crimson hue but also gained a red star.

Zhang Pianpian warned, "According to the divine power network's judgment, you are now a one-star criminal."

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu felt the spiritual energy of heaven and earth stagnate, making it difficult for him to absorb.

Pressure bore down from the atmosphere as fierce gales transformed into tangible shockwaves, descending from the sky and blasting toward Zhang Yu.

With crackling explosions, the ground beneath him was blasted into massive craters by the aftershocks of the bombardment.

Yet Zhang Yu continued to advance, enduring the attacks.

Fleeing justice, violent resistance, environmental destruction, severe infringement...

As the charges piled up, Zhang Yu's criminal rating soared again, rocketing from one-star to three-star.

The divine power network's offensive grew increasingly terrifying.

Dozens, then hundreds of waterspouts descended from the sky. Each was composed of tens of thousands of high-speed water blades, slashing toward Zhang Yu at tens of times the speed of sound.

Vast clouds of sand and dust surged into the air. Every grain of sand became like a meteor or a flying sword, shattering the atmosphere with blinding fire as it slammed into Zhang Yu's body.

At this moment, all matter in heaven and earth seemed to have become weapons. Under the divine power network's control, they transformed into natural disasters pressing down on Zhang Yu.

With a deafening boom, Zhang Yu continued his high-speed charge, enduring the attacks.

He was still 120 kilometers away from True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

Watching this, True Monarch Junior College thought, "The divine power network's attacks are fully adjusted to target the individual."

"The network can access all data on a target cultivator from the Spirit Realm. It uses this vast amount of data to determine the target's strength, combat style, and other basic intelligence..."

As True Monarch Junior College pondered, the divine power network's next wave of attacks descended instantly.

A rapid series of crackling explosions erupted from Zhang Yu's body. Initially, these impacts only left gashes on him. But as the divine power network continuously increased its attack intensity, clouds of blood mist began to burst from his body.

As Zhang Yu pressed forward, his flesh was visibly torn apart.

True Monarch Junior College sneered inwardly. "Based on the data, the divine power network can devise different attack methods, constantly increasing the intensity, and even adapt its attack patterns to exploit weaknesses."

"No matter how strong you are, the divine power network will always summon a slightly stronger force to suppress you."

"This is a truly relentless, unending assault — a true heavenly calamity."

Of course, with True Monarch Junior College's talisman skills, the heavenly calamity he could summon from the divine power network couldn't reach the Soul Transformation level. But in his view, it was more than enough to deal with Zhang Yu.

The next moment, with a furious roar, Zhang Yu surged forward. The ground beneath him trembled violently as he activated the Level 40 Mount Sumeru King Sutra, instantly dispersing the force of the impacts. His wounds began to heal gradually.

However, in the very next instant, the divine power network's attack intensity surged again. A torrent of countless water blades, like the Heavenly River overturning, rushed toward Zhang Yu with the force to scour heaven and earth.

Watching Zhang Yu instantly engulfed by the onslaught, True Monarch Junior College sneered inwardly. "Tens of thousands of tons of material attacks per second — even with your advanced Spatial Technology, can you possibly contain it all?"

"Even with your profound Magic Power, can you withstand the endless power of heaven and earth?"

Just as True Monarch Junior College had this thought, a dragon's roar erupted from within Zhang Yu.

A giant dragon burst forth from his body, shielding him from the overwhelming attack.

But the moment the dragon blocked the onslaught, its body erupted in clouds of blood mist, clearly suffering severe injuries.

Yet, as this True Clone in dragon form took the damage, the Physical Divine Ability, Formless Freedom Body, activated intensely, constantly adapting Zhang Yu to the attack.

So when the grievously wounded dragon retreated back into his body, and the countless water blades struck Zhang Yu's skin again, they only produced a series of explosions, leaving no wounds at all.

As if sensing this, the divine power network once again increased the intensity of its attacks.

Wind Cannons, Tornado Water Blades, Sandstorm Flying Swords, Divine Power Giant Hands, Heavenly Fire Incineration... Surging natural disasters struck again and again, their intensity repeatedly amplified under the divine power network's adjustments.

As the earth trembled, the figures of Demon Beasts — a giant dragon, an ox monster, a giant ape — burst forth from Zhang Yu's body. They shielded him from the relentless calamities before retreating back inside him.

Under this continuous onslaught, Zhang Yu's physical body was constantly wounded, constantly regenerating, and constantly advancing!

Even with heaven and earth as his enemy, nothing seemed to slow his steps.

When he was still 90 kilometers from True Monarch Immortal Slayer, Zhang Yu was wreathed in wind and fire, battered by torrential floods, and swept by frost... Wave after wave of deadly calamities had transformed the several-thousand-meter radius around him into a death zone.

Watching this scene, True Monarch Junior College retreated, a look of disbelief flashing across his face.

"Fine! I'd like to see how much longer you can last!"

True Monarch Junior College's fingertips twitched. After long preparation, he had finally fabricated a new crime for Zhang Yu.

"Tax evasion!"

Boom! The name above Zhang Yu's head turned completely crimson, and the number of stars behind it shockingly increased to four.

A terrifying pressure descended from the sky, making even the distant True Monarch Junior College feel a sense of suffocation.

Densely packed warning notifications suddenly appeared, ordering all uninvolved personnel to leave immediately.

In the sky, a blazing radiance flared. The sunlight from a thousand-li radius seemed to converge into a single point, then plummeted toward Zhang Yu like a falling star.

The figures of Demon Beasts erupted forth, surging to block the attack in front of Zhang Yu.

The giant dragon crashed to the earth as a fireball. The roc's physical body was charred black as it reeled backward. The ox monster roared in agony, severely burned...

As each Demon Beast intercepted the attack, Zhang Yu's adaptability continued to rise. He ultimately caught the final blow with one hand. Then, in a heaven-shaking explosion, his figure was completely engulfed.

But the next moment, more fiery lights flared in the sky, targeting Zhang Yu's position.

A warning appeared in his Bionic Eye: "True Monarch Blazing Light, please stop immediately and cooperate with the investigation."

Zhang Yu did not halt his steps. With a single stride, he left a long afterimage trailing across the ground.

Watching the figure emerge from the sky-filling flames, True Monarch Junior College could no longer conceal the shock in his eyes. "How is this possible? He even survived the tax evasion charge?"

At this moment, Zhang Yu was still 88 kilometers away from True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

Faced with Zhang Yu's imminent arrival, True Monarch Junior College retreated.

Whether intimidated by Zhang Yu's unstoppable battle intent or terrified by the heavenly calamities enveloping him, True Monarch Junior College subconsciously stepped aside, clearing Zhang Yu's path forward.

But just as a trace of unwillingness surged in his heart, a figure roared and charged toward Zhang Yu.

"Blazing Light!!"

Amid the explosive roar, the recently resurrected True Monarch Heaven Devourer activated his Civil Engineering Three Divine Arts, hurtling toward Zhang Yu amidst a meteor shower of fire.

Hundreds of real and illusory clones mingled within the chaos, unleashing a variety of martial arts in a coordinated assault.

His previous defeat at Zhang Yu's hands had filled True Monarch Heaven Devourer's heart with bitter resentment.

In his view, he had clearly held the upper hand in their last battle. Zhang Yu had only narrowly defeated him through the petty trick of scattering red packets and the minor tactic of calling for remote support.

Now, True Monarch Heaven Devourer had resolved to never carelessly pick up Zhang Yu's red packets again. The Ten Great Universities would also find it difficult to provide Zhang Yu with remote support...

"I will kill you! Today!"

But the next moment, as Zhang Yu advanced step by step, True Monarch Heaven Devourer's clones were enveloped by the heavenly calamities.

Then, True Monarch Heaven Devourer felt as if each of his clones was being bombarded by heaven and earth itself.

Amid a series of explosive booms, the clones shattered one after another under the onslaught of the various heavenly calamities.

True Monarch Heaven Devourer's heart trembled. "The power of these heavenly calamities is this strong?"

He had just been observing Zhang Yu's condition, watching him steadily block the heavenly calamities time and again, and had assumed the attacks posed a limited threat. He never expected that the divine power network, after repeatedly increasing the attack intensity, had already elevated the power of the heavenly calamities enveloping Zhang Yu to a terrifying level.

Sensing that half of his clones had been destroyed in the blink of an eye, True Monarch Heaven Devourer roared in fury and began a frantic retreat.

But the heavenly calamities relentlessly pursued, following Zhang Yu's every step.

True Monarch Heaven Devourer roared in fury. His clones unleashed their full power, desperately resisting the threat of the heavenly calamities, only to be annihilated one by one in an instant.

His eyes widened as he watched Zhang Yu's figure draw ever closer. He felt the intensity of the heavenly calamities surge abruptly, the danger in every inch of space skyrocketing.

He felt like a shallow-water fish being relentlessly dragged into the deep sea. As Zhang Yu approached, the pressure around him grew stronger, more immense, and utterly irresistible, crushing his spirit, ravaging his body, tearing his flesh, and snapping his bones.

Amid a series of explosive booms, True Monarch Heaven Devourer's body was continuously shredded by sandstorms, incinerated by heavenly fire, and crushed by atmospheric pressure...

Faced with this terrifying power, True Monarch Heaven Devourer could only retreat, again and again! And again!

*Boom!*

The moment Zhang Yu finally passed him, True Monarch Heaven Devourer was pulverized into dust by the terrifying power of heaven and earth, dissipating into the void.

On the battlefield, True Monarch Junior College was not the only one to witness this scene.

Watching Zhang Yu continue to advance, shrouded in terrifying heavenly calamities, someone immediately roared in the battle channel: "True Monarch Junior College! Stop him! Now!"

"Stop the divine power network from attacking him!"

"At this rate, he's dragging all of us into a contest of defensive power with him!"

True Monarch Junior College had, of course, already realized this. In fact, while True Monarch Heaven Devourer was being "walked" to death by Zhang Yu, he had been desperately trying to halt the divine power network's attacks.

But after repeated attempts, he made a shocking discovery...

"I can't stop it!" True Monarch Junior College exclaimed in disbelief. "Why can't I stop it?"

Not only could he not stop it, but he also found that the divine power network's attack intensity was still increasing. Zhang Yu's list of crimes continued to grow, threatening to break through the four-star rating and surge toward five-star.

At that moment, Zhang Yu was still 65 kilometers away from True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

True Monarch Calculated Deduction and True Monarch Flowing Treasure moved to block Zhang Yu's path.

As a major streamer in the Dark Spirit Realm and a proponent of the "Ten Universities Collapse Theory," True Monarch Calculated Deduction had kept his live stream running for most of the war.

The moment Zhang Yu began his charge, True Monarch Calculated Deduction started providing live commentary.

"The outcome is already decided. Zhang Yu coming here now is just suicide."

"Look, True Monarch Junior College has already locked onto him."

"The divine power network has initiated automatic attacks. Zhang Yu won't last long."

"He's finished. Even True Monarch Heaven Devourer couldn't withstand it. How long can he possibly hold on?"

"His Magic Power and vital energy must be severely depleted. His death is only a matter of time..."

According to True Monarch Calculated Deduction's commentary, although Zhang Yu continued to advance, he was gradually losing ground, his defeat seemingly inevitable.

Countless viewers deeply agreed with his analysis, placing their full trust in this Nascent Soul True Monarch from Heavenly Demon University's Finance Department.

Meanwhile, True Monarch Calculated Deduction had quietly activated his "Myriad Karma Slander Curse." With each slanderous remark, scathing critique, and sensational revelation, he channeled waves of curse power toward Zhang Yu, weakening his vital energy, slowing his Magic Power circulation, and reducing his physical strength.

As long as he maintained the Myriad Karma Slander Curse and convinced more people to believe his attacks, he could gather increasing amounts of Qi Luck to his side. This would allow him to continuously weaken his opponent, to the point where, under the weight of public opinion, he could directly strip away levels from the target's cultivation art.

Just as True Monarch Calculated Deduction launched his attack, True Monarch Flowing Treasure, who was beside him, also spoke up: "Excellent, excellent. Look at Zhang Yu — his movements are slowing, his actions becoming more labored. He's clearly a spent arrow at the end of its flight..."

Back when Auspicious God had invited True Monarch Great Luminosity and his two companions to deal with Bai Zhenzhen, he had also extended an invitation to True Monarch Flowing Treasure.

However, at the time, the True Monarch had declared that he didn't invest in junk stocks, trade in worthless coins, or participate in infiltration missions. No matter how Auspicious God pleaded with him, appealing to both emotion and reason, True Monarch Flowing Treasure refused to join the operation.

Afterward, seeing what had happened to Great Luminosity's trio, True Monarch Flowing Treasure felt immense relief at his decision.

But now, with the Righteous Qi Alliance holding an overwhelming advantage, victory seemed certain in True Monarch Flowing Treasure's eyes. Zhang Yu alone couldn't possibly turn the tide. Thus, he acted without hesitation.

As True Monarch Flowing Treasure spoke, his various criticisms of Zhang Yu also generated wisps of curse power that surged toward Zhang Yu's position.

True Monarch Flowing Treasure hadn't cultivated the "Myriad Karma Slander Curse," but his ultimate technique, honed over many years of bitter cultivation, allowed him to mimic other daoist arts. At this moment, he was replicating True Monarch Calculated Deduction's "Myriad Karma Slander Curse" to curse Zhang Yu.

Watching Zhang Yu's advance slow to a crawl, True Monarch Flowing Treasure sneered inwardly, "Still resisting? Then resist until you die."

In the next instant, a Nascent Soul abruptly materialized behind Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu and his Nascent Soul pressed their four palms together, simultaneously activating the Immortal Sect Technique, "Kunlun in the Palm"!

At the same time, under the enhancement of the Nascent Soul's Ten Great Extraordinary Meridians combination, "Cosmic Annihilation," the range of "Kunlun in the Palm" suddenly expanded dramatically.

"Useless..." True Monarch Flowing Treasure thought disdainfully. "We've already analyzed the data on your technique's range. Even if 'Kunlun in the Palm' has a wide reach, it can't grasp us from this distance..."

But in the next moment, True Monarch Flowing Treasure felt the world spin around him. He and True Monarch Calculated Deduction were suddenly much closer to Zhang Yu.

"What?!"

The two True Monarchs stared in shock, their minds still reeling, unable to comprehend what had just happened.

Meanwhile, several of Zhang Yu's True Clones were hidden underground, positioned between the two True Monarchs and Zhang Yu.

As these True Clones channeled the power of the Immortal Sect Technique "Kunlun in the Palm," they repeatedly dragged True Monarch Flowing Treasure and True Monarch Calculated Deduction closer. Through a relay of clones, they were being delivered directly toward Zhang Yu.

After another world-spinning lurch, the two True Monarchs found themselves much closer to Zhang Yu.

After several such shifts in the blink of an eye, by the time he and True Monarch Calculated Deduction regained their senses, they discovered they were in the palm of Zhang Yu's hand.

Furious and alarmed, the two Nascent Soul True Monarchs soared into the sky, attempting to escape the range of the Heavenly Calamity.

But in the next instant, Zhang Yu's Crime Level above his head rose again, jumping from four-star to five-star!

True Monarch Flowing Treasure shrieked, roaring into the combat channel, "Junior College! Stop him, you bastard!"

Watching this unfold, True Monarch Junior College's heart pounded. "That's the crime of counterfeiting currency."

"And it's large-scale mass production and circulation of counterfeit currency, violent resistance against the law, and assaulting a Righteous God..."

True Monarch Junior College stared at the long list of crimes, utterly horrified. "I didn't add all these charges!"

*Boom!*

The thunderclouds in the sky suddenly roiled.

Streaks of purple lightning erupted, crackling with world-destroying power, before converging into a single purple pillar of light that descended.

Faced with this terrifying force of Heaven and Earth, Zhang Yu dared not resist head-on. He pressed his palms together, activating both "Kunlun in the Palm" and his Immortal Space.

In an instant, the one-meter radius around Zhang Yu transformed into a black abyss, floating above the ground like a black hole.

The purple lightning pillar descended abruptly, continuously pouring into the black hole.

But True Monarch Flowing Treasure and True Monarch Calculated Deduction, who were nearby, weren't so lucky.

Almost at the instant the lightning pillar fell, all their magical artifacts shattered violently. Immediately after, their bionic bodies were completely destroyed, and finally, their flesh and blood disintegrated. Within seconds, their entire bodies turned to ash...

Just as the lightning pillar vanished, the black hole disappeared as well. Zhang Yu reappeared and resumed his charge toward the formation core.

But soon, the purple lightning in the sky flared again, continuing to unleash devastating power as Zhang Yu advanced.

When the second lightning pillar fell, Zhang Yu was still 60 kilometers from True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

Then the third, fourth... and by the time the fifth purple lightning pillar descended, Zhang Yu had closed the distance to just 38 kilometers from True Monarch Immortal Slayer!

Someone shouted in the combat channel, "The darkness he uses to block the lightning is getting fainter! Is his cultivation nearly depleted?"

"No..." True Monarch Junior College said bitterly. "He's adapting."

True Monarch Junior College had been pursuing Zhang Yu from behind, and through continuous observation, he had gradually begun to understand what was happening.

His voice was strained as he said, "Zhang Yu can adapt to attacks, increasing his resistance to similar ones. That's why he only uses Spatial Power to defend when facing attacks that exceed his limits."

"He was deliberately allowing more of the lightning to strike his body, bit by bit."

"The less lightning he absorbs with his Spatial Power, the more it means he's adapting to the strikes. He's gradually... overcoming this attack."

The ninth lightning pillar descended. This time, there was no black hole, no spatial distortion. The pillar completely engulfed Zhang Yu's figure.

But to everyone's astonishment, when the lightning pillar dissipated and Zhang Yu reappeared, his body was covered in scorch marks and burns, with even gaping wounds writhing as they healed.

Unseen by anyone, several of Zhang Yu's internal organs had been flash-frozen by his Profound Cold Meridian, accelerating their self-repair.

This was the most severe injury Zhang Yu had sustained since the battle began.

Yet, watching the wounds gradually close, everyone understood that True Monarch Junior College had been right...

True Monarch Junior College was inwardly shaken. "He's already adapted to this wave of attacks."

Unconsciously, True Monarch Junior College's pursuit slowed, and the distance between him and Zhang Yu grew ever wider.

At that moment, Zhang Yu was only 30 kilometers from True Monarch Immortal Slayer.
