# Chapter 742: The Path to Joining the Sect

Inside the hospital, Shi Huaiyu watched the award ceremony through her Bionic Eye while speaking to Tu Lishan in the adjacent bed. "Teacher, Zhang Yu just received his award. Will Yu Bonds go up in price?"

Seeing Shi Huaiyu's excited expression, Tu Lishan asked from his hospital bed, "Huaiyu, did you use all the money I transferred to you to buy Yu Bonds?"

Shi Huaiyu looked at him and replied, "Teacher, you're not thinking of asking for the money back, are you?"

Tu Lishan gave a helpless smile. It turned out that during the battle, he had ultimately used the False Death Life Stake Magic to preserve a final sliver of life. After the war, he was found and rescued by True Monarch Miraculous Hand.

"I thought this battle was lost," Tu Lishan sighed. "Even with the False Death technique, I didn't expect to survive."

At this moment, he felt he had plunged into the darkest period of his life: he hadn't died, but all his money was gone.

The thought of the bill True Monarch Miraculous Hand had sent him made him wish he had never woken up.

Just then, Shi Huaiyu said, "Teacher, I don't have much money left either. How about I transfer some Yu Bonds to you?"

Tu Lishan's eyes lit up. "Oh, I couldn't possibly accept."

"Ah, Huaiyu, ever since you enrolled, I knew you had a keen eye for investment."

"Don't worry. Even if I forget who ranked first in class, I'll always remember who gave me money. I'll make sure you're well taken care of in the future."

Wen Wuya watched Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen receive their awards one after another on the screen, but his mind involuntarily replayed a series of scenes.

It was the scene where Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, hand in hand, broke through the blockade of over a hundred Nascent Soul cultivators and finally fought their way to True Monarch Immortal Slayer.

When he saw that moment, Wen Wuya knew that Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's synergy — the coordination of their Magic Power, the adaptability of their Extreme Emotion Sword Qi — had long surpassed his imagination.

"So those two were actually..."

At the same time, more memories from their university days surfaced in his mind: Bai Zhenzhen, blushing and drenched, being found by him alongside Zhang Yu.

"So you've been secretly dual cultivating behind my back all this time, haven't you?"

"And I thought we were friends. Turns out I was just the third wheel."

Wen Wuya felt as if his two best friends had been secretly attending an elite tutoring class after school every day, ultimately tying for first place in the final exams and leaving him far behind.

"Then what's this?" Wen Wuya clutched his chest, resentful. "Zhang Yu, didn't you personally tune this? And I even repaired it for you."

"And what about this?" Wen Wuya touched the inside of his thigh and thought, "Bai Zhenzhen, in order to dual cultivate with you two, I've always been making preparations on two fronts."

Just as Wen Wuya was wallowing in sorrow, a cross-layer message appeared in his Bionic Eye.

Looking at the message from the Tenth Layer, Wen Wuya took a deep breath and silently replied: "Dad, I've broken through to the Golden Core Realm."

As a cultivator born, raised, and who completed the Highschool Exams on the Tenth Layer, Wen Wuya had been completely cut off from the upper layers during the recent Great Upheaval, in addition to losing the support of his original Soul Transformation Master.

However, he considered the final outcome a net gain. After all, he had obtained a Golden Core Qualification Certificate, allowing him to break through to the Golden Core Realm much earlier than planned.

At the same time, as he read his father's follow-up message, Wen Wuya's heart jolted in surprise, followed by a surge of intense fighting spirit.

He thought to himself, "After this over-issuance of realm qualification certificates, the Heavenly Court actually plans to promote a batch of people to join sects?"

As a native of the Tenth Layer, Wen Wuya knew exactly how rare such an opportunity was.

In truth, many people on the Tenth Layer had opportunities to go to the Eleventh, Twelfth, or even higher layers where the sects were located.

However, this "going" was vastly different from formally joining a sect. It was merely going to the sect to work, providing services for the cultivators within, and in the end, they almost always had to return.

Wen Wuya had once heard his father say that a long, long time ago... people who went to work for the sects had a chance to stay.

But for as long as Wen Wuya had been alive, he had never heard of anyone managing to stay by taking a job at a sect.

As for cultivators who entered sects through the official selection process, their numbers were pitifully small each year and dwindled further with each passing year. In Wen Wuya's view... the sects were probably on the verge of stopping recruitment from the lower layers altogether.

Wen Wuya had thought he would never have such an opportunity in his lifetime. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "To think I might still have a chance to join a sect."

His eyes flashed, and information about various positions at the Heavenly Sword Sect appeared in his Bionic Eye.

At the same time, another message arrived from Wen Wuya's father: "Study these Heavenly Sword Sect job descriptions carefully. Choosing a position is crucial. The popular ones are good, but the competition will be fierce. Some positions might have worse benefits, but your chances of getting in are much higher."

Inside a Spirit Realm livestream room.

Ye Xingli was watching an awards ceremony with her Vocational College friends.

As Zhang Yu walked onto the stage to receive his award, Ye Xingli glanced at her Poverty Simulator and recited, "True Monarch Blazing Light is the most deserving. It was his money that allowed millions of us Vocational College students to stand tall."

"Even though I'm a Ten Universities student, I have the heart of a Vocational College student."

Just then, a message from the 8th Layer appeared in her Bionic Eye: "What are you doing?!"

Ye Xingli's heart skipped a beat when she saw the message.

The sender continued: "And here I was, bragging to people that my daughter is a famous Spirit Realm streamer who can earn Spirit Coins just by showing off her legs. Turns out you're secretly pretending to be a Vocational College student in the Spirit Realm?"

Before Ye Xingli could reply, another message arrived: "Hahaha, good deception! That's my girl. These Vocational College students are weak and stupid — they deserve to have their Spirit Coins squeezed dry by you."

For some reason, as Ye Xingli read her mother's reply, she felt a faint unease, even though she knew her mother was right.

Her mother continued messaging: "Now, for serious business. I heard they've issued too many certificates this time, so the higher-ups are planning a Sect Staff selection to recruit a batch of cultivators into the sect. You'll need to choose a position when you register. I've asked around, and the best places in the Myriad Laws Sect are the Immortal Ascension Hall, the Providence Hall, and the Myriad Laws Palace Hall. The Immortal Ascension Hall is especially good — it's the administrative hub, the highest level of sect governance. Those who work there are involved in designing and executing the sect's strategies and policies."

Reading her mother's message, Ye Xingli's breath quickened. She murmured to herself, "Join the sect..."

At the awards ceremony, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood sat together in the audience, watching Zhang Yu speak on stage.

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sighed, "Old Gao, did you ever imagine you and your disciple would have such a glorious day?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood smiled. "Yurong, I have you to thank for this."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole snorted. "Thank me for what? For stealing your disciple? If you and that boy hadn't begged me so desperately back then, I wouldn't have bothered taking on a Civil Engineering student."

Divine Monarch Greenwood said, "Yurong, back when Zhang Yu was still in the Civil Engineering Department, you often tutored him, giving him one-on-one guidance, didn't you?"

"The 'new student' you mentioned taking on back then — that was Zhang Yu, wasn't it? You even told me, 'Old Gao, your disciple is truly amazing.' Were you planning to use the Civil Engineering Department's resources to train a student for the Artifact Refinement Department all along?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole asked, "When did you figure it out?"

Divine Monarch Greenwood replied, "If I hadn't brought it up, were you planning to keep it a secret forever?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said, "Old Gao, I was just afraid you'd be upset if you found out! At worst, we can just guide Zhang Yu together from now on. He can learn formations from you during the day, and I'll tutor him in artifact refinement at night. Together, we'll groom him to be the next principal of Myriad Laws..."

She trailed off, then let out a cold laugh. "Then everyone will know that my disciple, True Monarch Blazing Light, is best known for mixing concrete."

As they spoke, a series of messages suddenly appeared in their bionic eyes.

Reading the content, Divine Monarch Greenwood sighed inwardly. "Sect training? It seems we won't have time to train him ourselves."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole frowned, a trace of worry creeping into her heart. "All newly ascended Soul Transformation cultivators must attend this unified sect training. It'll last five years. I just wonder what the higher-ups' attitude is toward our batch of Soul Transformation cultivators and what arrangements they have in mind."

Divine Monarch Greenwood replied, "Attending sect training after reaching the Soul Transformation realm is standard procedure. Don't worry, nothing will go wrong."

While cultivators from all layers watched the award ceremony...

Deep within the Spirit Realm, shrouded by layers of protective barriers, figures exuding mysterious and noble auras gathered. They too were watching the grand live-streamed award ceremony. These were, in fact, the sect disciples who had recently descended.

As they watched, streams of information flowed between them, enabling continuous, high-speed communication.

"There are far too many Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators emerging from the Second to Fifth Layers. I say we should eliminate ninety percent of them. Why do we need so many Water Cores and Water Souls?"

"The higher-ups have already hinted at the plan: keep a batch, eliminate a batch, and send another batch to the sect. Heh, I heard some even want to seal the records, concealing the fact that this batch of Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators came from an expanded enrollment, to make it easier for them to advance within the sect later."

"Absurd. Bringing so many paupers up will only corrupt the sect's atmosphere. Where would any semblance of the Immortal Dao be left?"

"What's there to fear? All entrants must pass an examination. Do these frauds really think they can pass the Sect Staff selection? They're dreaming."

"What about this Zhang Yu?"

"This kid has immense influence. Of course, we should keep him here to manage the schools and companies for us. Use him to control the world's 'cattle and horses'."

"Splurging ten billion? I won't allow someone so arrogant to enter the sect."

"Yun Zhiguang, this is the dog your Myriad Laws Sect raised. What do you have to say?"

As Spirit Realm signals flickered, Yun Zhiguang, whose consciousness had also descended across the Spirit Realm, replied coolly, "You're asking me? I have only one thing to say."

"It's none of your damn business."

"Remember this: Zhang Yu belongs to Myriad Laws. It's not your place to interfere."

"If you have the means, buy him out with your money. Otherwise, don't try any tricks in front of me."

"I haven't used any of my assassination insurance quota this year."

With the awards ceremony concluded, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen flew together to the Research Association's office building in the Grand Void.

As he looked up at the sky, he could once again clearly see the landscapes of Kunxu's Fourth and Fifth Layers.

Ever since the Heavenly Court's descent, the Second through Fifth Layers had remained interconnected.

Zhang Yu had heard from Deng Bingding that to facilitate the upcoming Great Reconstruction, these layers would remain vertically linked for an extended period.

As they flew, Zhang Yu saw that the war-torn, devastated lands of the Fifth, Fourth, and Third Layers had transformed into massive construction sites, with rebuilding efforts underway everywhere.

The campus area near the Third Layer's Grand Void, benefiting from wartime construction and its convenient transportation and logistics, had temporarily become the command and operations center for the various schools.

Therefore, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen planned to rest and recuperate at the Research Association's headquarters in the Grand Void for the time being.

In the sky, beams of divine light occasionally descended — Righteous Gods enforcing the law.

Zhang Yu knew that since their descent, the Righteous Gods had been continuously searching records left in the Spirit Realm and the divine power network to investigate and settle various criminal acts.

That was why beams of divine light would occasionally descend to capture criminals, confiscate property, collect back taxes, or seize items.

Zhang Yu understood that with the Righteous Gods' strict oversight, order would gradually be restored to Kunxu's Second through Fifth Layers, and everything would slowly return to how it once was.

He sighed and said, "Perhaps in ten or twenty years, few people will remember what happened during this war."

Zhang Yu could already picture the people on the ground, gradually becoming consumed by endless work, slowly forgetting the experiences of the war.

"No way," Bai Zhenzhen said with a grimace, her tone serious. "Damn it... As long as you still owe them money, as long as they can collect interest every year, how could they possibly forget what you did?"

"The Yu Bonds will remind them, again and again, of what happened."

Zhang Yu chuckled softly. "Perhaps."

Afterward, the two returned to the Research Association without notifying anyone, hoping to rest quietly for a while.

But as Zhang Yu pushed open his office door, he saw a two-meter-tall figure sitting behind his desk. Her long legs were propped up on the tabletop, revealing a pair of fair, bare feet.

Seeing Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen at the door, Yun Zhiguang smiled faintly. "You're back?"

"Bai Zhenzhen, wait outside."

With a flick of her fingertip, Bai Zhenzhen found herself outside the office, staring at the tightly shut door.

"Zhang Yu, with this award ceremony, your name is now thoroughly established in the lower layers."

As she spoke, Yun Zhiguang flicked her finger again, and a Spirit Realm Projection of a card sank into Zhang Yu's body.

Yun Zhiguang continued, "I know you're drowning in debt and your accounts are almost all frozen. This is a credit card I requested for you. It has a monthly limit of ten thousand Spirit Coins. Use it for now."

As she finished speaking, Yun Zhiguang's figure flickered, and one of her bare feet was already pressing against Zhang Yu's chest.

Yun Zhiguang looked at Zhang Yu with satisfaction and continued, "Once I've finished with my current tasks, I'll recommend you for a year of training at the sect. When you return, you'll lead the construction of the Dharma Realm and oversee the affairs of the company and the university. You will be the next Principal of Myriad Laws University."

"At that time, I'll recognize you as my son."

Zhang Yu froze. "Son?"

Yun Zhiguang laughed. "Heirs bred from one's own bloodline have uncertain talent and offer low returns. They're little more than consumables. No one in the sect bothers with biological reproduction anymore."

"An adopted son, however, is one in ten thousand — carefully selected, someone who has grown strong on their own. That is a true son."

With that, Yun Zhiguang leaned close to Zhang Yu and said, "I wanted to reward you with something, but unfortunately, I don't use Spirit Coins, and there's no Dharma Realm here. Otherwise, I could have granted you ten or twenty years of cultivation."

"After thinking it over, I've decided we'll cultivate together daily. I'll transfer some of the cultivation from this physical body to you."

"Don't worry. I admire genius above all else. This is a gift, free of charge."

With a single stomp, Yun Zhiguang pinned Zhang Yu to the floor. Then, her figure shifted as she prepared to sit down on him.

Zhang Yu was riddled with secrets and feared this sect disciple would seize the opportunity to plant some hidden technique on him. He quickly stammered, "Yun... Senior Sister Yun, wait!"

Yun Zhiguang replied, "Wait for what? This is cultivation, not a game. I don't have time to play around with you."

Zhang Yu said, "Bai Zhenzhen is still outside. She cultivates the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao..."

Yun Zhiguang cut him off. "Relax. Did you think I wouldn't consider such a minor detail? I've already sealed her five senses. She can't see or hear a thing."

Zhang Yu hastily tried another excuse. "I... my carnal desires are too strong. Engaging in dual cultivation could shatter my Dao Heart."

Yun Zhiguang's expression turned stern. "You still have such a weakness? This is exactly why I say Myriad Laws University needs a dual cultivation course. Don't worry, Senior Sister will help you make up for this lesson and temper you properly."

In a flash of inspiration, Zhang Yu projected his copyright certificate for the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao — the very one Divine Monarch Seven Emotions had given him.

He declared, "I... I also cultivate the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao. I can't casually engage in dual cultivation with just anyone."

"Hmm?" Yun Zhiguang frowned, shaking her head as she looked at the copyright certificate. "Why would you cultivate something like this? If you go to the sect like this, wouldn't you... Sigh."

With a sigh, Yun Zhiguang looked at Zhang Yu as if he were a disabled person.

"Forget it," she said. "When I return to the sect, I'll leave this physical body for you. You can play with it yourself and figure out how to absorb its cultivation."

After finally getting rid of Yun Zhiguang, Bai Zhenzhen rushed in, anxiously asking, "Yu Zi! Did she do anything to you?"

"I'm so useless! I just watched her lock you in the room and couldn't do a thing!"

Zhang Yu projected the credit card with a 10,000 Spirit Coin limit and said, "Senior Sister Yun gave this to me."

Bai Zhenzhen gasped. "Yu Zi, what did she make you do? Would I have been a better choice?"

Zhang Yu sighed. "She said it was a reward, probably for something she wants me to do later."

"She also wanted to transfer her cultivation to me through dual cultivation. I only managed to persuade her to leave after telling her I cultivate the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"Sigh... People from the sects are truly reckless."

"She seems to care very little about her physical body, even wanting to give it to me like a gift."

Looking at the credit card with its 10,000 Spirit Coin limit, Zhang Yu showed no hint of joy.

He was no longer the naive high school student he once was; he didn't believe in free lunches.

Zhang Yu understood that the more Yun Zhiguang gave him, the more she expected to gain through him.

However, he knew far too little about the sect and Yun Zhiguang at the moment. Zhang Yu decided to find someone to talk to later and gather more intelligence first.

Bai Zhenzhen nodded. "It seems that unlike Myriad Laws University, the Myriad Laws Sect already treats dual cultivation as a common method for transferring cultivation."

The two then rested in the office for a while, and Zhang Yu took stock of his current situation.

"My Spirit Coins are completely depleted," Zhang Yu thought. "There's not a single coin left in my account. If I need money, I'll have to take out a loan, apply for a credit card, or borrow from someone."

He couldn't help but shake his head with a bitter smile as he recalled arriving in this world already burdened with a 700,000-coin loan. Now, after nearly ten years of struggle, not only was he penniless, but he was also saddled with debt exceeding ten of billions spirit coins.

"But given my current status, I should still be able to borrow a decent amount of money, right?"

Zhang Yu then opened his Talisman interface. As the Master of Ten Billion Talisman, he now had ten daily uses of low-grade talismans.

As for mid- and high-grade talismans, the penniless Zhang Yu couldn't afford to cast a single one.

Next, with a light tap of his finger, Zhang Yu summoned the shattered Heavenly Sun Radiance God and the 	
Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword.

"These magical artifacts are almost completely destroyed. It would be better to reforge them than to attempt major repairs."

He then brought out the Platinum Emperor, composed of 333 Bionic components, and the Heaven-Shattering War God Armor.

"They're heavily damaged. Both need extensive repairs."

After assessing his losses, Zhang Yu touched the Black Pearl that Lady Fortune had transformed into. "This might be one of my greatest gains," he thought.

"Lady Fortune should be waking up soon, right? I wonder what new functions the Feather Book will have after this upgrade."

Besides his anticipation for the Feather Book, Zhang Yu was also looking forward to the Soul-Guiding Pool in the Supreme Clarity Realm.

He was certain that the successive battles he had fought must have filled the Soul-Guiding Pool with all sorts of secret manuals.

Among all the potential drops, the ones he most eagerly awaited were those from True Monarch Immortal Slayer and Fu Xiantian.

These two powerhouses had died before him one after another, leaving Zhang Yu intensely curious about what secret manuals the Soul-Guiding Pool would receive.

After all, the Demon Beast Clone that True Monarch Immortal Slayer had reincarnated into was far too conspicuous. It had been directly executed by the Righteous Gods, and all information about it was suppressed. Otherwise, Zhang Yu's gains would have been even greater.

Amid a flash of light and shadow, Zhang Yu returned to the Great Purity Realm.

He strode quickly to the side of the Soul-Guiding Pool and immediately saw two Immortal Sect Technique manuals bobbing up and down within it. They emitted a dazzling radiance, like a sun and moon, making all the other manuals around them seem dim in comparison.

"《Heaven and Earth Are My Sword》, 《Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture》..."

Seeing the two manuals, Zhang Yu's heart stirred. "So it's these two?"

Just as his thoughts began to race, a voice came from behind him.

"Brother, you're here."

Zhang Yu spun around and looked at Zhang Pianpian. "Sis, are you okay? I couldn't reach you..."

Zhang Pianpian raised a hand to stop him. "I can't talk for long. Let's get to the important matters first."

The two activated the Supreme Clarity Realm's acceleration function and began a rapid exchange.

Zhang Pianpian looked at Zhang Yu with a serious expression. "This time, the Heavenly Court issued a large number of certificates to the Second through Fifth Layers. A massive influx of Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators has emerged within and beyond the Ten Universities."

"After consulting with the sects, the Heavenly Court and the sects decided on a plan for these cultivators: eliminate one batch, retain another, and then push a third batch to join the sects."

Zhang Yu's spirits lifted at her words. "Join the sects?"

Zhang Pianpian nodded. "That's right. However, entry into any sect is strictly by examination. Regardless of the position — even for Immortal Descendants — everyone must pass the Sect Staff Selection Examination."

"Previously, this examination was only held on the Eleventh to Twentieth Layers. Even cultivators from the First to Tenth Layers who caught a sect's eye had to travel to the Eleventh Layer to take it."

"But this time, the Heavenly Court plans to hold a Sect Examination in the lower layers."

Zhang Pianpian sighed. "The massive reconstruction of the lower layers, and now this promotion of the Sect Examination... I fear this has all been planned for a long time."

Zhang Yu's heart pounded with excitement, his eyes burning with fighting spirit.

As long as he had a chance, as long as he could climb through examinations, Zhang Yu was confident he could secure a place in a sect.

He looked at Zhang Pianpian and asked, "How does the examination work, specifically?"

Zhang Pianpian explained, "First, you choose a position, then you take the exam. The content of the exam varies greatly depending on the sect position you choose."

She looked at Zhang Yu. "You've taken the university entrance exams, so you should know how crucial it is to choose the right university and major."

"Choosing a sect position is even more important."

"A sect is still an organization, and like any organization, resources are divided among its various departments. There are countless offices, large and small. Some are powerful and influential, granting you immediate access to the sect leader, a view from the highest echelons, and an absolute information advantage."

"Others are remote and stagnant, where you might never see a promotion in your entire life."

"Some control immense wealth, freeing you from any worries about cultivation resources."

"Others are 'clear water offices' — so poor they can barely sustain themselves."

"And then there are those at the forefront of the sect's most advanced Immortal Dao Technology, pushing the boundaries of Kunxu, where you might even receive instruction from Immortals..."

As he listened to Zhang Pianpian's explanation, Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened. He thought to himself, "The differences between these sect positions are probably even greater than the gap between the Ten Universities and a Vocational College."

Zhang Pianpian continued, "The more promising the position, the fiercer the competition. Each position also has different application requirements and preferences."

"The most crucial thing for you right now is to gather as much intelligence about the sects as possible and find the position that best suits you — the one you have the highest chance of securing."

"I'll do my best to help you gather information, but I'm tied up for a while and might not be able to contact you at any time. You'll need to figure things out on your own..."

After their conversation, Zhang Pianpian's figure quickly vanished, leaving the Supreme Clarity Realm.

Zhang Yu sent her a message but received no reply.

"I can't just wait for Sis. I need to find a way myself."

Zhang Yu's eyes flickered as the image of True Monarch Starfire appeared in his mind, along with Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, Divine Monarch Greenwood, and others who had previously attended sect training.
