# Chapter 97: Borrowing Zhen's Spiritual Root

Zhang Yu only felt a chill on his lower back as something drilled into his dantian's sea of qi and then began to take root and sprout.

Zhang Yu was no stranger to renting spiritual roots; almost the instant he felt the change in his dantian, he thought of a spiritual root.

_How did a spiritual root suddenly appear in my dantian?_

Immediately after, he felt... that after the spiritual root rapidly took root and sprouted, it spread throughout his entire body, covering every inch of his flesh and blood like a nervous system, as if it had always been a part of his body.

Even as his Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method performed its passive breathing exercise, these spiritual roots that had spread throughout his body also inhaled and exhaled with it, quickly drawing the spiritual energy from the air to surge towards him.

"Hiss!"

Like sweet rain after a long drought, as streams of spiritual energy poured into his body, Zhang Yu felt every fiber of his being desperately crave the incoming spiritual energy.

After all, for Zhang Yu, who was cultivating without a spiritual root, his body was in a state of spiritual energy deprivation most of the time.

Now that spiritual energy was suddenly pouring in from all over his body, Zhang Yu immediately felt a sense of comfort throughout his entire being, and the operation of his level 10 Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method became even more turbulent, stirring the surrounding spiritual energy to swarm towards him.

And this state of Zhang Yu's immediately caught Bai Zhenzhen's attention.

Especially since she could faintly sense that her spiritual root was currently inside Zhang Yu's body.

_My spiritual root went into Yu-boy's stomach?_

A trace of surprise appeared in Bai Zhenzhen's heart.

_What's going on? I wanted to lend it to Yu-boy to play with, but that was supposed to be after he got on his knees and begged me like 'Mom, please!' Why did you, spiritual root, run over on your own?_

Thinking of this, Bai Zhenzhen felt a surge of annoyance. She reached out and fumbled around Zhang Yu's stomach, trying to pull her spiritual root back out.

Feeling Bai Zhenzhen's hand groping his lower abdomen, sending waves of ticklish sensations, Zhang Yu quickly said, "What are you doing, Zhen! Stop groping! We're going to have a traffic accident! We can't afford to pay if we kill someone!"

Zhang Yu came to a halt, his Sports Car Legs decelerating rapidly, finally stopping by the roadside as he set Bai Zhenzhen down.

Having failed to retrieve her spiritual root, Bai Zhenzhen said unwillingly, "Did my spiritual root run into your stomach?"

Zhang Yu subconsciously touched his stomach and said, "This is your spiritual root?"

_Didn't that evil god say... this is Zhen's own spiritual root, not a rented one? How can it end up in my stomach?_

The doll, disguised as a prayer bead, was also astonished at this moment. _This woman's spiritual root can be transferred?_

Bai Zhenzhen naturally didn't know the thoughts in Zhang Yu's mind. After all, from her perspective, Zhang Yu shouldn't know the secret of her spiritual root yet.

And now that her spiritual root had already drilled into his body, Bai Zhenzhen decided to stop being secretive.

She nodded directly and then said through gritted teeth, "This is the spiritual root I've nurtured for over a decade. Does it feel good to use?"

Zhang Yu wanted to say that it did indeed feel great, but seeing Bai Zhenzhen's angry expression, he refrained from saying it.

He just touched his stomach and asked curiously, "Why did your spiritual root come to me?"

"Actually, I've had a spiritual root in my stomach since I was a child," Bai Zhenzhen sighed, then continued, "This thing is different from ordinary spiritual roots; it seems to grow along with me."

"In the last two years, it has even started to adapt and grow in different directions according to the thoughts in my mind."

"Like when you mentioned borrowing a spiritual root last time, I was wondering if it was possible."

"And today, this damned thing just drilled into your stomach on its own!"

Hearing Bai Zhenzhen's words, Zhang Yu's face couldn't help but show a look of shock. _No way... there's such an outrageous spiritual root?_

But the mention of the spiritual root jumping into Zhang Yu's stomach infuriated Bai Zhenzhen, and she reached out to grope his stomach again.

Then, a look of contempt appeared on her face as she tutted, "Not being neutered is really a hassle. How can you get a reaction from just a few rubs on the stomach? Do you need some time to take care of it?"

_Don't you damn well know how vigorous my qi and blood are these days before you go groping?_ Zhang Yu suddenly felt like a good friend had barged into his room and seen him with one hand holding a tissue and the other in his pants.

It was also at this moment that Zhang Yu suddenly gained a profound understanding of Songyang High School's sterilization policy.

If they weren't sterilized, a group of hormonal teenagers who worshiped scores and money would be messing around together every day. After three years of high school... wouldn't their scores drop?

Under Bai Zhenzhen's contemptuous gaze, Zhang Yu retreated several steps and said, "Don't be anxious. Think carefully about how the spiritual root got into my stomach just now."

So, after some discussion and research, Bai Zhenzhen had Zhang Yu carry her on his back again.

As Bai Zhenzhen hugged Zhang Yu from behind and repeatedly chanted in her mind for the spiritual root to return, she felt a sudden warmth in her stomach the next moment—her precious spiritual root was back.

And with the return of the spiritual root, a surge of spiritual energy also poured into Bai Zhenzhen's body, drilling into her limbs and bones.

"Hiss!"

She sucked in a cold breath, shocked. _How does it feel like this thing is absorbing spiritual energy more powerfully than before? And it's even gathering in places where I don't usually circulate my mana?_

But soon, the spiritual root seemed to be re-adapting to Bai Zhenzhen's body condition and returned to its usual state.

A thought suddenly occurred to Bai Zhenzhen. _Could it be that after entering Yu-boy's body, it actively adapted to his physique and took on his shape... and that's why the change happened?_

_But it returned to normal after a short while, reverting to my shape... is it because the time it spent in Yu-boy's body was too short?_

Bai Zhenzhen suddenly became curious. _If it stays for a longer time and adapts more to Yu-boy's body... what will happen?_

On the other side, as the spiritual root in his dantian disappeared and the feeling of abundant spiritual energy faded, a trace of disappointment welled up in Zhang Yu's heart.

Just then, he heard Bai Zhenzhen say, "Yu-boy, I'll try passing the spiritual root to you again. Get ready to receive it."

The next moment, Zhang Yu felt the spiritual root return to his body, once again taking root and sprouting in his dantian.

Spiritual energy from the air whistled as it poured into his body, making Zhang Yu feel a sense of fulfillment.

_As expected, a cultivator just needs a spiritual root to feel right._

Although he felt great, Zhang Yu understood that the spiritual root in his stomach was the key for Bai Zhenzhen to become stronger and get into the Ten Greats.

So Zhang Yu suppressed the reluctance in his heart and said, "Alright, Zhen, take this spiritual root back quickly. Don't damage it by moving it in and out."

Hearing this, Bai Zhenzhen replied, "It's fine, leave it with you for a few hours. I have an idea I want to test."

"Huh?" Zhang Yu said with delight. "Then... then I'll lend you my Talisman Tome to play with."

"Give it here!" Bai Zhenzhen reached into Zhang Yu's robes and snatched the Talisman Tome. "My spiritual root is worth at least several hundred million. This Talisman Tome will be collateral with me for now."

Then she patted Zhang Yu's shoulder and said, "Hurry up and get to school, don't be late and get chewed out by that devil incarnate Su Haifeng."

So, Zhang Yu carried Bai Zhenzhen all the way to school.

On the way, Bai Zhenzhen hugged Zhang Yu, leaning against his back, playing with the Talisman Tome while occasionally telling him about the current functions of the spiritual root.

Zhang Yu suddenly said, "Calling it 'spiritual root' all the time feels like it could get confusing with other spiritual roots in conversation. Shouldn't we give it a name?"

Bai Zhenzhen was slightly taken aback. Since she was a child, she had only thought about hiding the spiritual root. After entering high school, she would never mention the spiritual root in her stomach to anyone.

So, all this time, she had simply called it 'spiritual root' in her mind, since she naturally knew which spiritual root she was referring to.

Hearing what Zhang Yu said now, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but nod slightly.

"Hmm... then what should we call it?"

"This is your spiritual root, so let's call it the Zhenzhen Spiritual Root."

"That's so lame," Bai Zhenzhen pouted. "Let's just call it the True Spiritual Root. By the way, when we get back, we'll tell everyone that I've lent you my rented spiritual root."

Bai Zhenzhen smiled. "Heh heh, that will further solidify the fact that this spiritual root of mine is a rented one."

So, for the rest of the journey, Bai Zhenzhen continued to tell Zhang Yu about the various wonderful uses of the True Spiritual Root.

Concealing the spiritual root, concealing herself, accelerating martial arts cultivation, seeing through flaws in combat, accelerating mana refinement, and the body tempering assistance function she had been using recently.

Zhang Yu's eyes lit up as he listened, wishing he could start ascetic training immediately.

And this entire process, including the conversation between Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, was naturally witnessed and heard by the evil god doll disguised as a prayer bead.

Her evaluation of this was, of course, only... foolish.

_Idiot! Idiot! Zhang Yu is an idiot! With such a heaven-defying spiritual root, you should kill her and take it immediately! I have a hundred damn ways to help you dispose of Bai Zhenzhen's body, I guarantee you won't be discovered._

_With the help of this heaven-defying spiritual root, forget about getting into the Ten Greats, you'd even have a chance at graduate school... no, a Ph.D.!_

_If you don't act now, you might be backstabbed by this woman in the future! How could she possibly tolerate such a huge secret being in someone else's hands forever?_

But seeing Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's trusting appearance, the evil god knew that even if she said it, he wouldn't listen, and it would only increase Zhang Yu's dislike for her.

_Damn it, this is the inherent flaw of the poor, always believing in ephemeral things like friends, feelings, and trust... these things are completely useless, they only hinder you from making money!_

_Money! Only money is the most important thing!_

After returning to school, apart from the general knowledge courses for all three years of high school that he had already mastered, like Chinese and Math, Zhang Yu simply skipped his mana and combat classes as well.

The mana teacher, Teacher Yan, and the combat teacher, Teacher Lei, were old acquaintances of Zhang Yu's and knew his level in mana control and martial combat. The first-year courses were indeed of little help to Zhang Yu, so they both approved his absence.

In this way, in addition to the physical education class he was already skipping, Zhang Yu could surprisingly use more than half of his school day for free ascetic training.
