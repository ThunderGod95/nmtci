# Chapter 193: Two Pills in One Gulp

Watching Ye Lingxiao’s veins bulge and muscles twitch, Yu Xinghan thought, _This Magic Power Meridian Injection is pretty intense. Don't tell me even this young master from the Immortal Capital can’t handle it?_

Nearby, Meng Tao’s face lit up with excitement as a sliver of hope rose in his heart. _Was Ye Lingxiao careless?_

Joy flashed in his eyes. _The Magic Power Meridian Injection isn’t even sold publicly. Could it be he’s never used it before? He took one shot, not expecting the drug to be so potent that even he can’t withstand it?_

But in the next instant, a smile touched the lips of the still-convulsing Ye Lingxiao. Taking a deep breath, he said with an expression of pure bliss, "A highly pure spiritual-catalyst. It's been a while since I've come across such potent stuff."

Ye Lingxiao felt his dantian and meridians become highly stimulated by the spiritual-catalyst. Not only did he feel no discomfort, but he also experienced a unique thrill as magic power coursed wildly through his body.

Although he had never injected this specific Magic Power Meridian Injection before, he had long used its core component, the spiritual-catalyst, in his cultivation.

He had even grown so accustomed to the muscle spasms it caused that they now brought him a degree of pleasure.

_But today is an exam, after all. That’s enough playing around._

Ye Lingxiao had always taken exams very seriously.

From the bloodline tests in kindergarten, to the parent examinations in elementary school, to the general knowledge exams in middle school, and all the other tests he had faced growing up, Ye Lingxiao had always fought for first place.

For him, coming in first was a habit, but more than that, it was a form of respect for Kunxu and the rules of this world.

_The Immortal Dao is a path paved with endless examinations and rankings._

_To ascend its peaks, one must consistently achieve the most outstanding results, pass through layer after layer of assessments, and forever remain at the top._

_This is the law of Kunxu, the path of the Immortal Dao._

Ye Lingxiao took a deep breath. In the next moment, his convulsing flesh abruptly stilled, then expanded explosively.

It wasn't just his muscles swelling; his bones, which he normally kept forcibly compressed, stretched out as well. Ye Lingxiao’s height shot up to a full 3.5 meters, and the muscles all over his body seemed to layer upon him like plates of armor.

Watching this, Meng Tao was initially stunned. _He forcibly stretched his muscles to expand his body? What's the point of—_

But then, seeing the relaxed look on Ye Lingxiao's face as he slowly shook his limbs and stretched, Meng Tao realized the truth. _No… he isn’t forcibly expanding his muscles. He's releasing his body's restraints._

_This is his true form._

_His usual smaller size is the result of intentionally suppressing his muscles and bones._

_Does he maintain a smaller form for his training?_

Meng Tao didn't know the answer, but he knew that Ye Lingxiao’s power was far more terrifying than he had ever imagined.

He was already no match for him at a similar size. Now he discovered that the other was even taller and more powerfully built…

_His muscle mass is at least double mine,_ Meng Tao lamented internally. _Worthy of the man hailed by Oasis Group as possessing the most perfect physique in high school._

In terms of physical power alone, Meng Tao already felt he was worlds apart. He also knew that greater body weight and muscle mass meant a higher tolerance for drugs.

However, Meng Tao was soon shocked to discover that this was not Ye Lingxiao’s limit.

Ye Lingxiao twisted his body, and the magic power in his dantian surged, transforming into Longevity magic power.

Then, as he moved through a series of body tempering exercises, the Longevity magic power began to nourish his body and expel toxins.

Level 10 Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, activated!

_Spring and Autumn Endless Zen?_ Meng Tao recognized the cultivation technique, his eyes wide with shock. _The strongest physique, terrifying martial aptitude, and an endless supply of money… Heaven knows how many cultivation techniques this guy has learned._

_He can probably pull out a different technique for any situation he faces._

Meng Tao sighed inwardly. _Besides Yun Jing, there probably isn't a single high school student in the entire first layer of Kunxu who could stand against him._

As Meng Tao was lost in thought, he noticed another candidate inject three consecutive shots into his arm.

Seeing the other's focused and serious expression, Meng Tao snapped back to reality.

Ye Lingxiao was formidable, but no matter how strong he was, he could only take one first-place spot.

_I can still fight for second!_ Meng Tao thought. _Even if I can’t get second, finishing third or fourth for the extra points would be good…_

He grabbed a syringe from a box and jabbed it forcefully into his neck.

Nearby, Yu Xinghan watched them both inject drugs with frantic intensity. _Are they trying to snatch second place… or just aiming for bonus points?_ he wondered.

He looked at Meng Tao, whose skull was beginning to bulge and head was becoming pointed as his brain expanded and metabolized the drugs. Then he looked at the other person, who was continuously injecting their muscles until their flesh was swollen and edematous…

A chill went down Yu Xinghan’s spine. _These people from the Immortal Capital are absolutely reckless when it comes to drugs. If I try to keep up with them… my body will suffer severe damage._

With that thought, Yu Xinghan’s gaze shifted to Zhang Yu, only to see that his score was still zero. He hadn’t taken a single dose.

_What is that guy doing?_

Zhang Yu had been waiting and observing Ye Lingxiao, supremely confident that he had only one true opponent in today's Foundation Establishment exam.

When he saw Ye Lingxiao take the Magic Power Meridian Injection, Zhang Yu knew he also had to choose one of the 1500-point divine drugs.

After a moment's calculation, Zhang Yu made his decision. _I'll try the Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor first. It not only seems a bit more reliable, but it can also boost my physical strength._

Meanwhile, the righteous gods observing the exam were commenting on Ye Lingxiao's performance across their network.

Huang Zichou remarked, "This Perfect Bloodline is arguably the strongest in the first layer of Kunxu. The Ye Clan's development of it has been impeccable. Once they officially begin selling the bloodline modification service, it will likely dominate the market."

Another righteous god added, "Perhaps competing for the Foundation Establishment certificate this time is a prelude to the Ye Clan's promotional campaign for the Perfect Bloodline. The hype surrounding Ye Lingxiao next year will probably be immense."

"Hehe, their company's stock should see a healthy rise."

At this, the righteous gods present shared a knowing smile. Even the perpetually stern Deng Bingding allowed a faint smile to grace her lips.

Huang Zichou continued, "It seems Ye Lingxiao has secured first place with that injection. The others can only compete for the remaining positions."

Another righteous god lamented, "This Perfect Bloodline strengthens the body, alters one's physique, and grants extraordinary drug tolerance and an affinity for learning cultivation techniques. The physical trial has become Ye Lingxiao's solo performance. How can anyone else possibly compete?"

Just then, Huang Zichou said with a hint of surprise, "Zhang Yu is going to use the Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor?"

"Can he withstand its side effects?"

This same question immediately surfaced in the minds of the other righteous gods, who instantly pulled up Zhang Yu's data.

"His monthly exam scores over the past two months have shown no improvement; they've even declined."

"Based on his demonstrated performance, he shouldn't be able to handle the Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor."

"Hmph, too impulsive. Prepare for a medical intervention."

Just as the gods were thinking this, they saw Zhang Yu, who had just swallowed a Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor pill, stand perfectly still for a moment before swallowing a second one.

_The load from this drug isn't as great as they made it out to be,_ Zhang Yu thought.

The gods were stunned. "What?!"

"Two pills at once?! Is he trying to get himself killed?!"

A candidate dying during the Foundation Establishment exam would be a major incident.

Deng Bingding, Huang Zichou, and the other righteous gods immediately focused their attention on Zhang Yu. Their divine power descended from afar, poised and ready to intervene at a moment's notice.

One god asked with concern, "Does this kid have medical insurance?"

Huang Zichou replied helplessly, "I checked. It expired a long time ago."

But in the next moment, his expression firmed, and he declared, "I was the one who passed him in the initial test, after all. I'll handle the rescue. I'll cover the medical expenses for now."

Upon hearing this, the other righteous gods looked at Huang Zichou with expressions of goodwill.

Deng Bingding nodded. "Don't forget to record the surveillance footage. I'll sign your reimbursement form later."

Hearing this, Huang Zichou felt a flicker of joy, thinking he had now made an even deeper impression on Lady Deng.

Meanwhile, after swallowing two Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor pills, Zhang Yu felt waves of heat radiating from his stomach, like flames surging through his limbs and bones.

Simultaneously, as the drug took effect, he felt sharp pangs of abdominal pain, as if a large hand were churning his stomach and intestines.

_The side effects from two pills are indeed much stronger._

_But I feel… my body can take it._

After briefly assessing the changes in his body, Zhang Yu seized the opportunity, harnessing the drug's surging potency to begin practicing the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen.

He was unlike Ye Lingxiao, whose magic power and physical strength had long reached level 10, and who used the technique purely for detoxification and purification.

Zhang Yu's physical strength was currently at level 9.89. Having taken two pills of Phoenix-Mimic Functional Factor, he intended to use their fierce medicinal power to push his body to the next level.

He twisted his body and circulated his Longevity magic power, his muscles and organs continuously nourished and purified in the cyclical rhythm of spring and autumn.
