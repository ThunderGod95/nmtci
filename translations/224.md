# Chapter 224: Instructional-Grade Bionic

Zhang Yu thought, _The High School Sacred Body grants me a much stronger drug metabolism ability than my opponent._

_If he were to accumulate a large amount of medicinal toxins, it would likely damage his body and affect his performance._

_But that won't happen to me._

_Accumulating medicinal toxins with the High School Sacred Body, then detonating them with the Spring and Autumn Endless Zen, and finally combining that with the explosive power of the Martial Dao Holy Embryo… that is my true full strength._

Meanwhile, Ye Lingxiao sensed the fighting spirit emanating from Zhang Yu and thought, _This person’s strength is immense._

_With his skill level… his skill level right now… if he had been in the last exam… with him here now, his strength is indeed immense._

_To completely defeat him, I too must use my full strength and surpass my limits once again._

As Zhang Yu and Ye Lingxiao were each contemplating the current state of the competition and planning their subsequent moves, Huang Zichou began to instruct them to remove the Black Armor Spiritual Roots and prepare for the next round of the exam.

At the same time, a light screen flashed before Huang Zichou’s eyes, displaying a series of images of Foundation Establishment cultivators using the Black Armor Spiritual Root.

“The two candidates are, after all, only at the Qi Refinement level, so they can only draw out the most basic 100% power of the Black Armor Spiritual Root.”

“If this Divine Spiritual Root were to be activated by a Foundation Establishment cultivator who could inject sufficient magic power into it, its power would be more than ten times greater.”

Zhang Yu watched the images on the screen, which showed a fire dragon a hundred meters long and a gale like a tornado. He couldn't help but lick his lips again.

_This really is a commercial, isn't it?_

He glanced toward the spectator stands. _Is it an advertisement for those universities?_

Then, Zhang Yu somewhat reluctantly withdrew his magic power from the combat suit, feeling the fire dragon behind him and the whirlwind at his feet gradually dissipate, and watching as the Black Armor Arcane Aegis faded away.

He sighed inwardly, _When will I ever be able to have a Divine Spiritual Root like this?_

Although it had only been the test mode and he hadn’t truly used the Black Armor Spiritual Root, Zhang Yu could already feel its immense power.

“The combat power this combat spiritual root possesses is on a completely different level from a Heavenly Spiritual Root.”

“And that’s with my strength being insufficient. If I could use this Black Armor Spiritual Root to achieve Foundation Establishment, wouldn’t I be ridiculously strong?”

_No, no, this Black Armor Spiritual Root is a combat spiritual root. My goal is beyond Foundation Establishment, at least Golden Core, or even Nascent Soul. I should be using a cultivation-type spiritual root…_

But in the next moment, Zhang Yu realized he was fantasizing too much. The reality was that he couldn't even afford a Heavenly Spiritual Root, let alone this Divine Spiritual Root.

After collecting the Divine Spiritual Roots, Huang Zichou began to explain the content of the second round of the exam.

“As everyone knows, once your magic power reaches 100 units, you can install one piece of a bionic.”

“And thereafter, the higher your magic power, the more pieces of the bionic you can install and support.”

“Therefore… the higher one’s realm and the greater one’s financial resources, the more pieces of the bionic one will have on their body.”

“So, for this second round, the content of the test will be to see how well your bodies adapt to bionics, to determine who is superior…”

As he spoke, Huang Zichou’s divine power rippled, and he brought over several pieces of equipment, arranging them around Zhang Yu and Ye Lingxiao, transforming the scene into something resembling an operating theater.

“In this exam, I will use a talisman from the Ministry of Health to temporarily sever some of the connections you have to your own bodies, redirecting your nerve signals to a bionic for a time.”

“This is not truly giving you a bionic, nor will you need to provide magic power for it. It is merely to simulate the sensation of having a part of your body replaced by a bionic.”

“Throughout the process, you will simulate a total of three bionics. The level of your synchronization rate with the bionics at the end will represent your score for this round…”

According to Huang Zichou’s explanation, the synchronization rate with a bionic represented the host’s control over it.

The higher the synchronization rate, the more of the bionic’s power the host could unleash.

And if the synchronization rate was too low, not only would the bionic’s power be wasted, but there would even be a risk of the bionic going out of control and the host suffering from cultivation deviation.

As Huang Zichou spoke, Zhang Yu and Ye Lingxiao were already lying on operating tables, surrounded by a multitude of wires, patches, and monitoring devices.

From the spectator stands, the Husky Head avatar watched this scene and commented, “This round has been designed quite well.”

“For Zhang Yu and Ye Lingxiao to have obtained such powerful bodies, they must have undergone a great deal of cruel training and stimulation from alchemical enhancers.”

“Having acquired such powerful bodies through hellish training, and having overcome countless obstacles with these strong physiques, their minds and bodies have become deeply integrated. It is very easy for them to become too attached to their own flesh.”

“Many first-year university students fall behind precisely because their original bodies are too strong and the mind-body connection is too tight, making it difficult for them to adapt to bionics.”

“The path of physical cultivation requires one to be able to both pick things up and let them go. To constantly strengthen oneself while also being able to continually accept newer and stronger bionics—that is the true orthodox path of the Immortal Sects…”

Cat Head, who was beside him, did not respond to this evaluation. He only spoke after seeing the first piece of the bionic that Huang Zichou brought out. “Is that the eye-type bionic from Heaven's Eye Corporation?”

“Tch, it’s an advertisement aimed at us, as expected.”

“They want more universities to purchase their instructional-grade eye-type bionics, don’t they?”

Meanwhile, on the examination field, two crystal-clear eyeballs, resembling a pair of gems, floated before Huang Zichou.

He introduced them, “This is the eye-type bionic recently developed by Heaven's Eye Corporation—Foresight…”

From Huang Zichou’s introduction, Zhang Yu learned that bionics were graded as instructional-grade, professional-grade, and enterprise-grade.

And above enterprise-grade were military-grade and immortal-sect-grade, the same as magical treasures and cultivation techniques.

What Huang Zichou was holding at that moment was an instructional-grade eye-type bionic.

After this bionic was implanted, not only could it be used to retrieve various kinds of data through vision, but its artifact spirit also came with simple functions such as intelligent recognition, smart search, and tagging.

Of course, aside from these most basic functions, its most important features were connecting to the network and observing the Spirit Realm.

Huang Zichou said, “…In daily life at a university, using an eye-type bionic to connect to the network for payments, communication, inquiries, and other such functions is all commonplace.”

“And the Spirit Realm is even more commonly encountered at a university. Without an eye-type bionic, one would be no different from a blind person…”

Meanwhile, Huang Zichou thought to himself, _It is precisely because of this that all universities uniformly issue eye-type bionics to new students, to prevent them from having difficulties living on campus._

_These eye-type bionics are purchased in bulk by the various universities and then charged to the students._

_Students can either pay in installments or temporarily mortgage their own eyes._

_However, eye-type bionics are not expensive, and most people are able to pay them off before graduation. But unless they remain on the second layer, an eye-type bionic is useless on the first layer. University graduates who return almost all switch back to their own eyes, selling the bionic they used during their university years to recoup some of their costs._

But Huang Zichou understood that although a single instructional-grade eye-type bionic was not valuable, the sheer volume of bulk purchases made by the various universities was immense.

Heaven's Eye Corporation, a company specializing in eye-type bionics, had clearly set its sights on this market, which was why it had invested money to advertise here.

Looking at the representatives in the spectator stands, Huang Zichou thought to himself that he had charged too little for this advertisement.

After Huang Zichou finished his introduction, a talisman from the Ministry of Health was activated, and Zhang Yu felt a searing divine power pierce through his eyes.

The next moment, he felt his vision go black, and he had lost all sense of sight.

It was not just the loss of vision. With Zhang Yu’s level of control over his body, he could not even feel the existence of his eyeballs in the slightest, as if that searing light had just gouged both of his eyes out.

This sensation made Zhang Yu very uncomfortable, and he even felt a sense of inexplicable nervousness.

Meanwhile, Huang Zichou said, “Do not be alarmed. I have only temporarily disconnected you from your eyes. Your eyes are still perfectly intact.”

“Now, I will transfer your nerve signals to the Heaven's Eye brand eye-type bionic—Foresight.”

“This is an eye-type bionic that even Qi Refinement stage students with only 100 units of magic power can adapt to. The process is very simple, and the burden is very light, so there is no need for you to be nervous…”

Before Huang Zichou had even finished speaking, Zhang Yu felt a sharp pain in his eyes, and immediately after, he saw a hazy array of light and shadows.

Huang Zichou continued, “Foresight will automatically adapt to your visual system. It may be a bit blurry at first, but it will clear up in a moment.”

Like the focusing process of a camera, at first, Zhang Yu felt that everything he saw was blurry and indistinct, as if covered in a mosaic.

But soon, he felt his eyeballs seemingly contract and expand continuously, and everything around him became clearer and clearer.

Yet the scene that he now saw before his eyes was completely different from the examination field just a moment ago.

“This is…”

Looking up, he saw a vast and boundless, cloudless azure sky.

Looking down, he saw a magnificent and majestic, boundless ocean that seemed to spread out like an endless bolt of blue silk.

At that moment, Huang Zichou’s voice came once again. “We have temporarily overlaid a layer of the Spirit Realm onto the examination field. You should all be able to see the scenery of this Spirit Realm now, correct?”

The next moment, with a sweep of Huang Zichou’s divine power, the vast sea and sky vanished without a trace.

But now, in their eyes, the cold floor of the examination field was filled with advertisements for various spiritual roots and bionics, all kinds of promotional videos, and information about discounts and special offers.

Zhang Yu was slightly taken aback. _Is this how the examination field looks in the eyes of the righteous gods and the university representatives from the second layer?_

_Information that can only be seen after implanting an eye-type bionic._

At this moment, a thought surfaced in Zhang Yu’s mind. _If… the Spirit Realm entered through the spiritual interface mask is a virtual world._

_Then the so-called unfolding of the Spirit Realm in reality is like AR technology, merging a virtual environment with reality. It is a real world that can only be seen clearly with an eye-type bionic._

_Without an eye-type bionic, you don’t even qualify to see the advertisements on the upper layers?_
