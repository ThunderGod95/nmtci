# Chapter 439: A Genuine Promise

Myriad Laws University.

Outside the pharmacology laboratory.

Le Jingchen, exhausted from several days of work, slowly emerged, intending to attend a few classes to unwind.

Glancing at the accumulated unread messages in his Bionic Eye, he suddenly noticed a surge of activity in the Songyang Hometown Group.

His gaze fell upon the latest message:

Yu Xinghan, the health massage therapist for Zhang Yu, the Military Certificate holder from the Myriad Laws Civil Engineering Department (ranked 29th): Well said.

Startled, Le Jingchen clicked on Yu Xinghan's profile. The first thing he saw was a newly taken photo of Yu Xinghan massaging Zhang Yu!

Scrolling further up the chat history, Le Jingchen grew increasingly astonished. He immediately contacted his younger sister, Le Mulan.

---

Inside a luxurious dormitory:

Yu Xinghan was frantically replying to messages. Ever since posting the photo of himself massaging Zhang Yu, the Military Certificate holder, numerous old clients had reached out with inquiries.

Over the past two years at the university, Yu Xinghan had explored various fields — Civil Engineering, video production, massage therapy, and Dual Cultivation. Through these experiences, he had gradually come to a realization.

"Back in the day, Myriad Laws University didn't pay much attention to Dual Cultivation. Students were too busy with their studies!"

"But as the years passed, many students gradually exhausted conventional methods of self-improvement. Some began eyeing Dual Cultivation, hoping to gain an additional path to power!"

Yu Xinghan thought to himself, "Since companies and major corporations affiliated with the Joyful Union Sect struggle to gain a foothold here, Dual Cultivation... has a vast untapped market at Myriad Laws University!"

"This is a new playing field born from the changing times!"

With this realization, Yu Xinghan glanced at the Zhang Yu fan group he had created.

He casually posted a photo of Zhang Yu receiving his certification and another of himself massaging Zhang Yu.

"As expected of the Dual Cultivation partner of a Soul Transformation disciple. When's the next session?"

"Is Zhang Yu doing a giveaway?"

"Share some Yu Juice with me! [Smirk]"

"I'm in."

"One session now costs at least 30 Spirit Coins..."

Watching the messages flood the fan group, Yu Xinghan imagined a horde of twisted, mutated creatures drooling and crawling on the ground, howling for sustenance!

"Sigh, it's a shame Zhang Yu only wants to meet people with Innate Special Magical Power and is only willing to exchange Magic Power!"

Yu Xinghan glanced at Zhang Yu and Le Mulan on the other side of the dormitory, thinking, "Damn it... Why not just make money properly instead of offering free services here? What a waste."

Meanwhile, Le Mulan said, "Stop licking so much!"

Le Mulan: "Hmm... Go ahead and put it in."

Zhang Yu: "My vital energy has been strong lately, so the force might be a bit intense. Brace yourself!"

First, Le Mulan inserted her fingertip into Zhang Yu's mouth, transferring the Medicinal Power produced within her body to him.

After a moment, Zhang Yu reciprocated, forcing streams of blood from his fingertip into Le Mulan's mouth.

Le Mulan opened her mouth to receive it, feeling a thick liquid surge down her throat. The intense aroma shot up her nasal passages, nearly making her cough.

"Zhang Yu's vital energy is so viscous, and the Medicinal Power within it is so concentrated!"

Le Mulan's tongue slowly swirled around the Medicinal Power, savoring and analyzing its composition.

"Zhang Yu's physique is becoming terrifying!"

"But how? His Physical Strength had already reached the Level 20 limit, right?"

"But in recent days, his physical prowess has actually improved in some areas!"

Just then, Le Mulan saw a message from Le Jingchen pop up in her Bionic Eye.

After asking about Zhang Yu's situation, he remarked, "Zhang Yu has always looked after you well. He's really good to you!"

Le Jingchen: "It seems he still holds onto old feelings. It's definitely worth cultivating a good relationship with him!"

Shortly after Le Mulan replied to her brother, she received a message from her mentor:

Yin Jiurao: "Is Zhang Yu still supplying materials?"

---

In the office, Yin Jiurao licked her lips, as if still savoring something.

"Ah, what a pity. He's temporarily out of stock!"

"Otherwise, I could compare the differences in materials after his strength increased..."

She glanced at the research paper before her.

Yin Jiurao decided to include Zhang Yu's Military Certificate scores as supporting evidence in her paper.

She then messaged Le Mulan: "If you don't have the premium materials, other materials will do. Just let me know if you get any."

Yin Jiurao: "If you can provide them, I can include you as a co-author on this paper I'm working on!"

---

Zhang Yu had just finished his collaborative session with Le Mulan for the day and was watching her communicate with someone through her Bionic Eye.

Suddenly, Bai Zhenzhen's avatar popped up on his own Bionic Eye!

"A-Zhen!" Zhang Yu smiled and accepted her communication request.

As her projection materialized, Zhang Yu asked, "Did you see the photo I sent you?"

Bai Zhenzhen nodded enthusiastically, her face beaming. "Yu Zi, now that you have the Military Certificate, can you finally master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power of your department by gathering the Seven Wonders?"

"This brings you one step closer to the Ten Great Leagues!"

After chatting for a while, Bai Zhenzhen's projection leaned against Zhang Yu, whispering, "Yu Zi, I miss you!"

When will we meet again? she thought. I wish I could lend him my Divine Spiritual Root so his cultivation progress could accelerate even faster!

Zhang Yu said, "I'll be participating in the Civil Engineering Inter-University League soon. They've changed the format — matches are spaced out now, and we'll have to compete at different universities."

"We'll probably go to Heavenly Sword University too. We can meet then!"

Bai Zhenzhen's face lit up. "Really? That's wonderful!"

"We absolutely have to... we have to see each other every day!"

Bai Zhenzhen had originally wanted to say, "Let's meet every day and cultivate our Divine Spiritual Roots like crazy!" But realizing their communication might be monitored, she changed her wording.

Zhang Yu sensed her gaze and understood her unspoken intent. A-Zhen, I can't wait to exchange spiritual roots with you either!

Hehe, you're going to be so surprised!

Two Divine Spiritual Roots exchanging energy... I wonder how much stronger we'll become!

Zhang Yu replied, "Alright, let's meet every day then!"

Bai Zhenzhen saw the understanding in his eyes and couldn't help but smile.

"Then it's settled! I'll wait for you at Heavenly Sword University!"

As soon as Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen began communicating, messages started flooding Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

Wen Wuya: "Zhenzhen, are you done yet?"

Wen Wuya: "How much longer?"

Wen Wuya: "The Teacher is coming. Hurry up."

Wen Wuya: "At least reply! [Urgent]"

Bai Zhenzhen: "Ok."

---

Heavenly Sword University.

Several students watched Bai Zhenzhen hugging the air beside them, her smile brighter than ever before.

A hint of surprise crossed their faces. One of them remarked, "Oh? So Zhenzhen can actually smile? I thought she'd had her facial nerves removed!"

Another student chimed in, "Of course she smiles! She has a first-layer friend. I heard she always laughs when she talks to them!"

Upon hearing it was a first-layer friend, the others' faces lit up with understanding.

A first-layer friend, they thought, is basically like a pet or mount. It's perfectly normal to laugh when you're with them.

Wen Wuya stood nearby, listening to the students' conversation with a cold sneer. Fools, he thought. They can't even tell the difference between a first-layer friend and a pet!

He glanced at Bai Zhenzhen's reply to his message. She's still replying to me while communicating with Zhang Yu? he mused. I'm making progress. At this rate, I'll win my bet with Divine Monarch Seven Emotions in no time!

Then he noticed Zhang Yu's profile picture. He actually got a Military Certificate?

Even though it was a Military Civil Engineering Certificate, Wen Wuya, a Soul Transformation disciple, saw obtaining any Military Certificate as a monumental distinction. Zhang Yu's status in his eyes had suddenly shifted dramatically.

After a moment's thought, he opened his contacts and changed Zhang Yu's note from "Bai Zhenzhen's first-layer friend (Civil Engineering Department)" to "Bai Zhenzhen's friend (Military Certificate holder) (Civil Engineering Department)."

Just then, a sword light descended from the sky, and a figure materialized before the crowd.

"I am Jin Quemingxiao, your special training instructor!"

"If you want to join the school team and compete in next year's Grand League, there are three crucial things you need!"

"Money!" "Money!" "Money!" "And more money!"

"To participate in my special training, the first in-class test will be to reveal your account balances!"

"The lowest will be immediately eliminated!"

"You have five minutes to prepare. The test begins in five minutes!"

---

After ending his call with Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu returned to the Artifact Refinement Laboratory and resumed his daily work.

"Today's project: the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill!"

This was precisely how Zhang Yu utilized his monthly reimbursement of 30 Spirit Coins, placing orders for magical artifacts through Ye Xingli's connections.

"One Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill still isn't enough!"

Having fully dedicated himself to his Military Certificate work, Zhang Yu had gained a deeper understanding of his current workflow.

"If I could acquire more Great Unity Golden Liquid Pills, my efficiency would skyrocket!"

"After all, I'll be competing in the Inter-University League soon. I need to seize every opportunity to strengthen myself!"

After reaching the Foundation Establishment Limit in all his basic attributes, Zhang Yu knew that his next path to strengthening himself lay in three main areas: magical artifacts, Bionics, and Cultivation Arts. Aside from the Dao Seed and Chain Formation Diagram from his Feather Book, these were the most common methods used by other students.

Among these three, military-grade power offered the greatest potential for improvement. However, more numerous and better-suited magical artifacts would also be highly beneficial to Zhang Yu. This was especially true since he was already learning artifact crafting, making magical artifacts a natural way for him to enhance his strength.

I wonder how Director Gao is doing. When will I be able to take the Seven Civil Engineering Techniques test and obtain the remaining Seven Wonders?

Just then, Director Gao sent him a message:

Director Gao: Ping Han has joined Ji Yuanshu's team!

Director Gao: He wants to challenge you to a duel in the next round!

Zhang Yu: What do you want me to do?

Director Gao: Defeat him utterly!

Director Gao: I want you to knock some sense into him!

Director Gao: Crush this unhealthy trend of the Civil Engineering Department speculating on foreign currency!

Director Gao: Show them your might! Prove you deserve the remaining Seven Wonders! Make them understand you're crucial to the Inter-University League!
