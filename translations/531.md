# Chapter 531: Zhang Yu's Refugee Camp

Seeing Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang's condition, Zhang Yu immediately understood they hadn't been faring well lately.

At the same moment, Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang both sensed Zhang Yu's gaze upon them.

Ying Xin waved lightly at Zhang Yu and sent a message: President Zhang!

Zhang Yu: What happened to your Bionic?

Ying Xin: I didn't have time to repair it.

Ying Xin: Repairing Bionics is too expensive right now. I'm planning to wait until this economic crisis passes before getting it fixed.

Zhang Yu: In the company group chat, several avatars from your family have gone dark.

Ying Xin: With the recent economic crisis, jobs are too hard to find, so they've been temporarily frozen.

Ying Xin: Don't worry, President Zhang. If anything happens to the company, the four generations of us will work hard to handle it.

Ying Xin: If we need more manpower, I'll wake them up immediately.

Meanwhile, on the other side, Shi Yunxiang was also messaging Zhang Yu.

Shi Yunxiang: Senior, do you want to buy meat?

Shi Yunxiang: So many people are desperate for money now. They keep trying to steal my meat to sell it.

Shi Yunxiang: I figured it's better to sell it to you than live in constant fear. Once I'm down to just a few pounds of meat, no one will bother me anymore.

Zhang Yu activated his Earthly Fiend Gravity. His floating body flickered slightly, and he instantly appeared before them.

Seeing the weariness in Shi Yunxiang's eyes, Zhang Yu patted his shoulder and said, "Don't worry. After seeing me protect you today, fewer people will try to take advantage of you."

"Keep the meat for yourself. Train hard, and your value will only increase in the future."

Before either of them could react, Zhang Yu extended his hands, grasped both of them, and channeled a surge of Magic Power into their bodies.

As Zhang Yu's incomparably pure Magic Power flowed through them, both Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang's faces lit up with relief.

Over the next few days, Zhang Yu set aside an hour each day to oversee the construction site and casually feed them Magic Power.

Each time, Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang would patiently wait nearby, letting Zhang Yu finish his work before receiving the energy.

Zhang Yu had assumed they were simply punctual, but one night when he arrived at the site for work, he found Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang already there, quietly waiting in the distance.

Later, Zhang Yu learned that they had been waiting at the site every day, looking for work.

During this time, Zhang Yu also encountered Su Yanyang, who managed to secure jobs thanks to his exceptional strength. However, Zhang Yu later observed that Su Yanyang would disappear for several days after working just one day.

It was unclear whether they couldn't secure daily work or had other commitments.

At that moment, Zhang Yu saw Shi Yunxiang and Ying Xin again, their condition visibly worse than before.

Shi Yunxiang's fur was severely matted, and he had grown even thinner.

Both he and Ying Xin were missing a leg, an arm, and an eye, clearly having dismantled all detachable Bionics to conserve energy.

Recalling the days when Shi Yunxiang and Ying Xin had fought alongside him in the arena, striving for victory, and remembering the bone ashes Ying Xin had given him, Zhang Yu gradually made up his mind.

After work, Zhang Yu approached them and asked, "Do you two have a place to stay?"

As they nodded, Lady Fortune couldn't help but interject, "Don't tell me you're planning to bring more strays home again? The dorm's already overflowing with paupers! Every time I go in, it reeks of poverty. Doesn't it bother you?"

"Yes, they helped you before, but they can't help you now."

"There are countless university students like them. You can hire as many as you want if you have the money."

Ignoring Lady Fortune's words, Zhang Yu turned to the pair and said, "Come squeeze into my dorm for now."

Ying Xin paused briefly, then quickly replied, "No need, President Zhang. I don't want to rent a room."

Shi Yunxiang nodded vigorously. "Rent is too expensive right now. We'd rather stay at the construction site and just weather the economic crisis."

Zhang Yu smiled. "Come on, then. No rent. Stay until the crisis is over."

The two stared at Zhang Yu in shock, their faces filled with disbelief. Only after he repeated his offer did they finally accept that he was genuinely letting them stay for free.

With a thud, both knelt on the ground, gazing at Zhang Yu with deep gratitude.

"President Zhang!"

"Senior!"

At the same moment, the gratitude of the Ying Family elders flashed in Zhang Yu's bionic eye.

Lady Fortune sighed. "A loss! Another damn loss! Zhang Yu, you just love meddling, don't you?"

Amidst the surprised glances of his roommates, Zhang Yu led the pair back to the dormitory, making the already cramped space feel even tighter.

Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang were equally surprised to see the others in the room.

After a brief exchange of greetings, everyone settled into their respective corners. Ying Xin and Shi Yunxiang took the spots closest to the door, immediately focusing on their breathing techniques to absorb spiritual energy.

Xiao Qingxuan and Shi Huaiyu leaned against the cultivation area, searching for part-time jobs through the Spirit Realm.

Yu Xinghan's eyes flickered with holographic displays as he watched videos of martial dao techniques while multitasking with work.

The economic crisis triggered by the Soul Transformation conflict had plunged Yu Xinghan's health company into a business slump.

Fortunately, the company was run by his mentor, so he hadn't been laid off yet.

Closer to Zhang Yu, Le Mulan leaned against the wall, her eyes tightly closed. Alternating waves of icy cold and scorching heat radiated from her body as she practiced the Pharmacology Department's drug synthesis techniques, internally synthesizing medicinal compounds.

Zhang Yu sat at the innermost part of the dormitory, next to Zhang Pianpian's empty seat.

Zhang Pianpian was participating in the Ten Greats League and hadn't been staying in the dormitory recently.

Just then, Zhang Yu beckoned to Ying Xin and said, "Let me take a look at your damaged Bionic."

Moments later, Zhang Yu activated the Fire Control Divine Mirror, unleashing streams of True Fire. Under Ying Xin's bewildered gaze, he skillfully repaired the Bionic.

Across the room, Xiao Qingxuan watched the scene and turned to Shi Yunxiang, his former competition teammate. "You're injured," he said. "Let me take a look."

"But I use Ancient Medical Techniques. If you don't trust it, that's fine."

With prices soaring and medical costs skyrocketing, Shi Yunxiang, like many others, had been enduring his injuries and illnesses, hoping they would heal on their own.

Hearing Xiao Qingxuan's offer, Shi Yunxiang immediately asked about the price.

Xiao Qingxuan replied, "Don't worry, I don't have a medical license, so I can't charge you."

Upon learning that Xiao Qingxuan lacked a medical license, Shi Yunxiang instantly relaxed. "Alright, treat me however you see fit."

Several hours later, as a holographic projection materialized in the air, Yu Xinghan asked, "Has today's match started?"

Zhang Yu, who had activated the projection, nodded. "Our school is competing in today's battle."

During this period, Zhang Yu had been cultivating in the Supreme Clarity Realm daily while also broadcasting the Ten Greats League matches in their dormitory.

However, most of the time, the occupants, including Zhang Yu himself, would only glance at the screen occasionally, treating it as background noise.

The only times the crowd truly paid attention were during clashes between Soul Transformation cultivators.

Only then, amidst the economic crisis gripping them, could they glimpse the shifting tides of power.

On the screen, Dao Qiankun, the Heavenly Chosen of Myriad Laws University's Dao Techniques Department, was weaving Dao Seals, summoning catastrophic weather phenomena that turned the floating island battlefield into a chaotic mess.

Zhang Yu sent another message to Bai Zhenzhen, but still received no reply.

He thought to himself, "I saw A-Zhen take tenth place in the Sword Duel just a few days ago, so she should be safe."

The next moment, Xiao Qingxuan exclaimed, "They're fighting again!"

Zhang Yu immediately looked up. Myriad Dao Radiance blazed across the sky, but it was impossible to discern which two Soul Transformation cultivators were clashing. The chat was flooded with speculation.

Yu Xinghan remarked, "Can't tell who it is. We'll have to wait for someone in the Spirit Realm to post a detailed analysis video."

Soon after, the group began watching analysis videos of the Soul Transformation battle.

"The one who unleashed a radiant glow stretching ten thousand zhang must be Divine Monarch Celestial Evolution of Myriad Laws University. Truly worthy of being the supreme master of daoist arts! Legend has it he holds patents for over ten thousand daoist arts, earning astronomical sums in royalties each year. His specialty lies in observing daoist arts, modifying them into his own, then rapidly refining them through multiple iterations until they surpass the original versions."

"The other combatant appeared almost silent, but our analysis of the battle's timeline reveals that the most dramatic fluctuations in Spirit Coin prices occurred at Myriad Laws University and Joyful Union University. This strongly suggests the other fighter is Divine Monarch Spirit Rhinoceros of Joyful Union University."

"Divine Monarch Spirit Rhinoceros's attacks may seem silent and subtle, but that's precisely the overwhelming power of the Great Harmony of Yin and Yang Celestial Melody. It's like hearing thunder in silence, subtly making you fall in love with him without realizing it. No wonder he's the supreme influencer with over ten billion followers! I bet even without patents or assets, he could single-handedly support an entire university just through fan donations."

"While making this analysis video, I unconsciously donated 5 Spirit Coins to Divine Monarch Spirit Rhinoceros. Can you feel that irresistible charm? Go follow him fiercely!"

Even with just a daily glance at the Ten Greats League standings and the clashes between Soul Transformation cultivators, the dormitory residents could sense the escalating intensity of the situation.

As Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs from the Ten Great Universities began entering the fray one after another, Zhang Yu increasingly felt the Soul Transformation cultivators were subtly dividing into two factions.

One side consisted of Myriad Laws University, Heavenly Sword University, Immortal Armaments University, and Vajra University.

The other side comprised Netherworld University, White Bone University, Heavenly Demon University, and Joyful Union University.

As the Soul Transformation cultivators moved, the economic crisis deepened.

The Financial Storm Warning level had risen from 1.8 to 2.3. Stock and cryptocurrency prices continued to plummet, commodity prices surged, and finding employment became increasingly difficult.

With more people out of work, leisure time expanded, and the Spirit Realm echoed with the Righteous Gods' Anti-Cult propaganda.

Even Zhang Yu's luxurious dormitory gradually had its spiritual energy supply restricted, barely providing enough for the residents' daily needs.

Zhang Yu remained immersed in the Supreme Clarity Realm, silently studying one magical artifact refinement diagram after another.
