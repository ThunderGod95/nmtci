# Chapter 442: Just give up

Red Gang Qi erupted from the back of Ping Han's armor as he accelerated, tearing through the atmosphere and appearing before Zhang Yu in an instant.

Zhang Yu's Formless Cloud Gang spread outward, enveloping his entire body in a swirling mist.

Bang!

Zhang Yu blocked the punch, but the terrifying force behind it sent him flying backward.

"I prepared this entire set of magical artifacts for the Military Certificate Examination to improve my construction skills."

Ping Han's original strength, already formidable with the Bionic enhancement, had now skyrocketed. By using his Bionic to power his armor and the armor to amplify both his Bionic and physical body, he unleashed a meteor-like assault, repeatedly smashing Zhang Yu across the battlefield.

"And yet, they said my kill count wasn't high enough during the exam!"

With a deafening screech, Zhang Yu's feet plowed a hundred-meter trench into the earth. Looking up, he saw Ping Han charging in for another punch.

"Fine, if you want to compare combat power, I'll switch to my real combat gear. What have you got to fight me with now?"

Amidst a series of thunderous booms, Ping Han transformed into a black lightning bolt, tearing through the air as he relentlessly attacked Zhang Yu.

"I have the tenacity to endure repeated bankruptcies, the vision to decipher the cryptocurrency market, a Dao Heart forged through years of relentless cultivation, and the Qi Luck from this Jade Nectar Coin surge."

"You lack my wealth, my daring in coin speculation, and the wisdom to see the secrets behind the Jade Nectar Coin's rise. How can you possibly compare to me?"

Empowered by the Heavenly Abyss Armor, Ping Han's entire body erupted with Gang Qi, inhaling and exhaling the very atmosphere as he surged forward with unparalleled speed.

Simultaneously, the armor's Gang Qi shifted through nine vibrant hues, each representing a different form of destructive force: extreme heat, frigid cold, electromagnetic pulses, razor-sharp cuts, concussive vibrations, and more.

Ping Han's Spine Bionic, Leg Bionic, and Hand Bionic each drove Level 20 combat-style techniques, allowing him to unleash the full extent of his combat prowess.

Boom!

Another collision of Gang Qi shattered Zhang Yu's Formless Cloud Gang, revealing his true form beneath the swirling mist: a humanoid figure clad entirely in golden armor.

"Zhang Yu, I am wealthier than you, more skilled at making money, and possess greater potential in the Immortal Dao."

"Whether in construction or combat, my superior abilities allow me to adapt my tactics at will, ensuring I will always remain above you."

Ping Han roared, "Admit defeat!"

At that moment, countless projections of spectator comments materialized above the arena, a cacophony of voices urging Zhang Yu to surrender:

Surrender! Surrender! Surrender! Kneel! Surrender!

As if channeling the collective will of the crowd, Ping Han's fist crashed down upon the golden-armored figure, shattering it into dust.

---

In the Spirit Realm surrounding the arena, Ye Xingli had also manifested a projection, eager to witness the duel between Zhang Yu and Ping Han.

Having heard much about Zhang Yu, whom her Master highly valued, Ye Xingli was deeply curious about his true strength.

"Ping Han is formidable," she mused inwardly. "He's likely at the peak of power below Military-Grade."

"Zhang Yu only recently obtained his Military Certificate," she continued. "He probably hasn't mastered a military-grade cultivation technique yet."

"This battle pits two evenly matched opponents against each other," she concluded. "It should reveal the full extent of Zhang Yu's capabilities."

Just as Ye Xingli finished her thoughts, another projection materialized beside her.

"Xingli, you're here too?"

Hearing the voice, Ye Xingli turned to greet the newcomer with a smile. "Senior Brother Qianji!"

The metallic, automaton-like projection before her was none other than Yan Qianji, the All-Attribute champion of the Artifact Refinement Department, a master of multiple military-grade powers, and a personal disciple of a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch.

Appearing in his Spirit Realm projection form, Yan Qianji glanced at Zhang Yu and Ping Han with a hint of surprise. "Hmm?"

Watching Zhang Yu repeatedly withstand Ping Han's relentless attacks, Yan Qianji remarked, "Truly a gem of raw talent!"

He mused curiously, "With Zhang Yu's purely physical build, he's either aiming for a custom Bionic or planning to sell his body. Which do you think it is?"

Ye Xingli's mind flashed with images of Zhang Yu's artifact crafting skills, but she chose not to reveal this. Instead, she casually replied, "I'm not entirely sure myself."

Yan Qianji stroked his chin. "Such top-tier natural treasures... I'd love to see how they'd perform when integrated into a Bionic!"

"If he ever has any spare parts, let me know. I'll pay top dollar!"

Ye Xingli nodded, then asked, "Senior, haven't you been busy with the Heavenly Sun Radiance God update project? What brought you to this competition?"

Ye Xingli knew that the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, a military-grade Bionic developed by the Artifact Refinement Department, underwent continuous upgrades each year. By incorporating the latest Immortal Dao technologies, it maintained its military-grade rating in the Dao Repository of the Ten Great Sects.

Of course, every Bionic, based on its original framework, would eventually reach its limits. That's why the Artifact Refinement Department was constantly developing newer, more powerful models.

Hearing Ye Xingli's question, Yan Qianji explained, "This competition isn't just about Zhang Yu and Ping Han, or even the Civil Engineering Department anymore!"

"The Finance Department has been hyping it up!"

"The Finance Department?" Ye Xingli asked in surprise. "Are they promoting the Jade Nectar Coin?"

Yan Qianji snorted coldly. "Those bloodsucking vampires from the Finance Department would do anything!"

"As long as they can make Spirit Coins, colluding with external forces or selling out the school's interests is nothing to them. Even a moment's hesitation would reveal a flaw in their Dao Heart!"

Beyond mere profit, Yan Qianji understood this was an extension of the power struggles among the school's higher-ups.

Zhang Yu may be a Civil Engineering student, Yan Qianji thought, but True Monarch Cloud Haven personally selected him during the Military Certificate Examination. If Ping Han were to defeat Zhang Yu so easily, whose face would be slapped?

Yan Qianji knew that even if Zhang Yu lost, the Military Certificate could never be transferred to Ping Han. That would violate the Heavenly Court's established procedures and authority!

However, in the eyes of the school's leadership, especially the three Soul Transformation School Heads, True Monarch Cloud Haven would inevitably be seen as having poor judgment and being unreliable.

For the higher-ups at Myriad Laws University, sometimes a single impression could determine the success or failure of major initiatives.

As Yan Qianji spoke, a Spirit Realm Projection materialized, radiating golden light that stretched for miles.

An aged voice echoed forth: "Senior Brother Qianji, your misunderstanding of our Finance Department runs deep. How could we be the kind of people who would betray the university's interests for mere Spirit Coins?"

"With the recent surge in Jade Nectar Coins, we're mobilizing Myriad Laws University students to venture beyond campus and collect the profits from Joyful Union University!"

Ye Xingli turned to look, and a projection of an incredibly aged man in golden robes appeared before them. Every inch of his skin seemed to embody the very limits of decay.

Nine Heavens Liu, Ye Xingli thought. Another Soul Transformation disciple!

She knew that Nine Heavens Liu's true physical form in the material world wasn't this frail. This decrepit appearance was merely his Spirit Realm projection.

After all, the more one ages, the more it costs to extend their lifespan. Reaching extreme old age — beyond what ordinary people could achieve, beyond the natural limits of the body — was a privilege and a status symbol reserved for the wealthy. The poor simply couldn't afford to live that long.

Nine Heavens Liu smiled brightly at the arena. "Who would have thought Junior Brother Zhang Yu would advise against investing in Nectar Coins? If he loses now, I fear the juniors' enthusiasm for investing will only grow stronger!"

Yan Qianji said coolly, "Zhang Yu isn't necessarily going to lose."

Nine Heavens Liu watched the figure in the arena, completely suppressed and ultimately shattered by Ping Han's punch. "Is that so?"

"Senior Brother Qianji, care for a wager?"

Yan Qianji replied coldly, "I don't gamble."

---

At that moment, as Ping Han's final punch landed with full force, the golden-armored figure before him abruptly disintegrated!

Though the golden armor formed by the Golden Yi Golden Liquid Pill remained intact, the humanoid form within had burst like an overinflated balloon, no longer able to support the armor.

As streams of Gang Qi dispersed from the shattered form, the golden armor slowly clattered to the ground.

It turned out that what Ping Han had shattered wasn't Zhang Yu's true body, but a Formless Warrior clad in golden armor!

In the next instant, two more golden-armored figures erupted from the ground, one after the other, charging toward Ping Han from opposite directions!

Having now possessed three Great Unity Golden Liquid Pills, Zhang Yu could afford to use one Golden Armor Warrior as a decoy while launching a dual assault with the other two.

"Which one is real?"

"Which one is fake?"

Ping Han's bionic eye swept between the two golden-armored figures before him, then he sneered. "Whatever!"

He raised a single palm, and a torrent of Gang Qi erupted from the palm of his armor, coalescing into a scythe-shaped Blade Qi!

The Blade Qi cycled through nine colors, each layer of Gang Qi stacking upon the last until it finally settled into a vibrant emerald green.

"Zhang Yu, your Gang Qi's ability to deflect blows and redirect force is truly impressive!"

"But it has one fatal flaw: while it excels at countering blunt impacts, it struggles against sharp, slicing attacks..."

"Since you refuse to yield, then prepare to be defeated!"

Level 20 Nine Heavens Azure Fall Scythe activated.

This scythe technique, developed by a Martial Dao expert through countless market fluctuations, encapsulated years of trading wisdom and the cutthroat, bloodless essence of the financial world.

From the moment Ping Han saw it, he felt an inexplicable affinity for the technique, wielding it with effortless ease.

At that moment, Ping Han unleashed the Nine Heavens Azure Fall Scythe, channeling his physical strength, Bionic, and armor into the strike. The razor-sharp azure scythe descended like a celestial blade, crashing down from the heavens with devastating force.

The condensed Gang Qi carried unparalleled sharpness, imbued with a profound technique to shatter Gang Qi and penetrate the body. With each strike, it relentlessly severed the target's Magic Power at its very root.

In the next instant, the emerald Blade Qi fell, cleaving the hundred-meter radius of smoke and dust in two. The two Golden Armor Warriors were simultaneously split apart, their internal Gang Qi shattering into fragments.

As the Golden Armor Warriors crumbled, the earth beneath Ping Han's feet trembled violently.

While the Golden Armor Warriors had been engaging Ping Han, Zhang Yu had finally completed the first stage of forging the Formless Spirit General!

Now, Zhang Yu stood atop the ten-meter-tall Formless Spirit General, which burst forth from the earth with a thunderous roar!

The Formless Spirit General unleashed a primal roar, its maw erupting with a searing beam of light that surged toward Ping Han's head, threatening to engulf him completely!
