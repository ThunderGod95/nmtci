# Chapter 703: Nascent Soul-Tier Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier

The person currently speaking with Bai Zhenzhen was Divine Monarch Blade Commander, one of the five newly ascended Soul Transformation cultivators of Heavenly Sword.

Bai Zhenzhen remembered that even before the Great Upheaval, he had already been the vice-principal of Heavenly Sword University, though his authority and jurisdiction were not as extensive as they were now.

Back then, True Monarch Blade Commander had always been kind and approachable whenever he met Bai Zhenzhen, acting more like a family elder than a school administrator.

But after the Great Upheaval and the departure of Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, the relationship between Bai Zhenzhen and Divine Monarch Blade Commander gradually changed.

What had once been Divine Monarch Blade Commander giving Bai Zhenzhen Spirit Coin red envelopes gradually transformed into Bai Zhenzhen giving him Spirit Coin red envelopes.

The once approachable Uncle Blade Commander gradually became the stern and impartial Principal Blade Commander.

The office that had once been accessible at any time now required appointments and waiting periods.

Listening to Divine Monarch Blade Commander's instructions regarding the Sword Repository, Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but interject, "Uncle Blade Commander..."

"Hmm?" Divine Monarch Blade Commander raised an eyebrow. "How many times have I told you? At school, address me by my title. I'm giving you three days to resolve the Sword Repository matter. Get to it."

Bai Zhenzhen protested, "Principal, the Sword Repository was entrusted to me by my teacher..."

Divine Monarch Blade Commander cut her off coldly. "Anything within the school's boundaries is school property. The school is facing difficulties now. If the Divine Monarch were still alive, I believe her noble spirit would compel her to cooperate with the school's efforts."

Bai Zhenzhen countered, "But the Sword Repository has always housed the teacher's disciples and has been maintained with her personal funds..."

As she spoke, Bai Zhenzhen transferred 100 Spirit Coins to Divine Monarch Blade Commander.

After accepting the Spirit Coins, Divine Monarch Blade Commander said coolly, "I'll give you an extra hour."

"What the hell? Just one hour for 100 Spirit Coins?" Bai Zhenzhen's eyes widened in fury as she glared at the Divine Monarch Blade Commander before her, cursing inwardly, "You damn leech! Why don't you just rob me outright?"

Sensing Bai Zhenzhen's rising anger, Divine Monarch Blade Commander said coldly, "Bai Zhenzhen, out of respect for Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, I'll give you one more piece of advice."

"The Sword Repository's fate has already been decided by the University. Anyone who defies the overall plan will be crushed to dust."

"If you refuse to cooperate and dare to embezzle University property, no one will be able to save you."

Following this, Bai Zhenzhen visited each of the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs at Heavenly Sword University, the University's leaders, and the Soul Transformation disciples... only to be turned away at every door.

Once able to roam freely through Heavenly Sword University, Bai Zhenzhen now felt as if the entire institution had transformed into an impenetrable fortress, blocking her every move.

Kunxu's Third Layer, inside the Research Association near the Grand Void.

A glint of light flashed in Zhang Yu's eyes as he circulated his Magic Power, and a Spatial Barrier materialized in his palm.

When Zhang Yu first cultivated the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier Immortal Sect Daoist Art to Level 1, he could only create a Spatial Barrier the size of his palm.

By Level 11, the daoist art allowed him to create a Spatial Barrier large enough to envelop a person and manipulate its shape, bending it into various forms.

Upon reaching Level 21, Zhang Yu could instantly create a Spatial Barrier spanning dozens of square meters and control its movement.

Now, having advanced the Immortal Sect Daoist Art to Level 31, the Spatial Barrier rapidly expanded from his hand, enveloping the entire office — hundreds of square meters — in an instant.

As his will guided it, objects within the office began to phase through the Spatial Barrier.

"The Level 31 Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier creates a larger, faster Spatial Barrier, but those are secondary benefits... The key is its enhanced precision in determining which objects can pass through."

With a flick of his fingertip, Zhang Yu summoned Earthly Fiend Gravity, causing a chair to float effortlessly through the spatial barrier as if it were passing through air.

Next, he pointed his sword at the barrier. The flying sword struck with tremendous force, yet it met resistance akin to striking the outer shell of an ultra-high-strength magical artifact, unable to penetrate even an inch.

Zhang Yu mused inwardly, "The Righteous Qi Alliance's spatial barriers, including those separating the firmament layers, rely on this technology. It allows their forces to pass freely while blocking the Ten Great Universities' forces."

Of course, Zhang Yu knew that the Level 31 Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier alone couldn't breach the firmament using purely Immortal Dao Technology.

However, combining this technology to establish a foothold for the Ten Great Universities, along with other spatial products... would grant them a significant advantage in the war.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "So the second-generation Great Void Cloud Repository's development path should indeed be..."

Zhang Yu had long been familiar with the evolving capabilities of the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier, having thoroughly studied the Immortal Sect Technique's contents.

Zhang Yu had long planned the direction for the second-generation Great Void Cloud Repository's upgrade.

"The Immortal Sect Technique contains profound Immortal Dao Technology. As the cultivation art's level increases, each time I either burn my dao heart to activate the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology and generate design blueprints, or burn Spirit Inspiration to activate the Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart and synthesize blueprints, the consumption grows exponentially with each level."

As he spoke, Zhang Yu glanced at the basic data displayed on his Feather Book.

Although dedicating significant time and energy to cultivating the Immortal Sect Daoist Art had slightly delayed his foundational cultivation, the astonishing influx of resources and his innate talent still allowed his cultivation efficiency to far surpass that of his peers.

Currently, Zhang Yu's Dao Heart Level had reached 36 (78.39%), his physical strength was at level 37.49, and his Magic Power had reached 35,181 units.

"My Dao Heart Level should be higher, but I had to burn it earlier to activate the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology, which slowed down my cultivation progress."

Zhang Yu understood that to minimize the impact on his Dao Heart cultivation and reduce the consumption from activating the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology, he needed to approach each activation with utmost caution.

"We can't just design whatever comes to mind. We need a planned and systematic approach."

At that moment, Zhang Yu was sketching and scribbling on the Spirit Realm Projection before him, constantly refining his vision for the next iteration of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology.

Simultaneously, design blueprints were being transported from across the Spirit Realm to his workspace, all provisionally designated as backup materials for synthesizing new blueprints using the Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart.

A day later, Zhang Yu's first creation after reaching Level 31 in the Three Realms and Ten Directions Great Void Barrier was born, causing his Dao Heart Level to regress to 36 (33.75%).

This time, he added Spatial Lock and Spatial Unlock functionalities to the Great Void Cloud Repository.

This was by no means the final version of the Great Void Cloud Repository's second generation, but merely a starting point.

Upon completing this initial design, Zhang Yu immediately sent the prototype to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole.

He did this for two reasons. First, he needed Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's cooperation to lay the groundwork for upcoming transformations and production efforts. Second, he wanted to showcase the new Spatial Technology to Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, inviting her to participate in his design work and accelerate future progress.

After all, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole possessed the Dao Seed "Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology."

While Zhang Yu was engrossed in designing new products, Bai Zhenzhen had unknowingly spent a week at Heavenly Sword University.

Zhang Yu had been eagerly hoping Bai Zhenzhen would spend more time cultivating with him using their Spiritual Roots, so she could break through to the Nascent Soul Realm sooner and complete the second upgrade of their Divine Spiritual Root.

Noticing Bai Zhenzhen's prolonged absence, Zhang Yu couldn't help but send her a message to check on her situation and offer his assistance if needed.

But three hours passed without a reply.

Zhang Yu's gaze flickered, and he opened their chat history.

Bai Zhenzhen had messaged him immediately after arriving at Heavenly Sword University:

Bai Zhenzhen: They're trying to steal my Sword Repository!

Zhang Yu: Who's trying to steal our Sword Repository?

Zhang Yu knew Bai Zhenzhen deeply valued the Sword Repository entrusted to her by Divine Monarch Seven Emotions. It contained countless sword artifacts ranging from Qi Refining to Nascent Soul-Tier, and even a Soul Transformation-level flying sword. The entire repository was not only immensely powerful but also priceless, enough to tempt even a Soul Transformation Divine Monarch.

In the past, the higher-ups at Heavenly Sword University had feared Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, but as time passed, this fear gradually diminished.

Zhang Yu understood that this was ultimately an internal matter for Heavenly Sword University, and his rash intervention could easily create unnecessary trouble.

Bai Zhenzhen: Yu Zi, Master entrusted the Sword Repository to me. The sword artifacts inside aren't just swords; they're Master's disciples, my seniors, my Senior Brothers and Sisters, each imbued with their will.

Bai Zhenzhen: But the university plans to reclaim and dispose of them all, even sell them to Netherworld University.

Bai Zhenzhen: I can't just stand by and watch this happen.

Bai Zhenzhen: How could I face Master when she returns?

Reading Bai Zhenzhen's words, Lady Fortune sighed, "She's ruined. Bai Zhenzhen has been completely ruined by the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"Why not just dispose of those corpses and make some money? Keeping them locked in a vault to rot is such a waste, such a waste!"

Zhang Yu, however, understood Bai Zhenzhen's actions.

He thought to himself, "No matter what, Seven Emotions has shown A-Zhen great kindness. A-Zhen is unwilling to easily hand over Seven Emotions to her Sword Repository. This is A-Zhen's choice."

Since their last conversation, Bai Zhenzhen hadn't sent him any messages, and she wasn't even responding to his messages now.

After considering it, Zhang Yu decided to ask his acquaintance at Heavenly Sword University for information on the current situation.

Wen Wuya: Zhenzhen is currently under house arrest, and all her connections to the Spirit Realm have been severed. No one can contact her.

Wen Wuya: Unless Zhenzhen agrees to sign the Sword Repository transfer agreement, they probably won't release her.
