# Chapter 107: Physical Strength Ranking

The strongest is White Dragon High School?

Red Pagoda High School is certainly formidable as well.

If it were Purple Cloud High School, that wouldn't be impossible either.

What the hell? What is Songyang High School?

Songyang High School, Zhang Yu, 4.95?

The sudden appearance of Zhang Yu's score left countless people utterly stunned.

The students from the three major high schools were the most shocked of all.

Only because they had undergone modifications with the new body tempering technology did they truly understand the chasm between their former and current selves.

Chu Qiuhe stared intently at the "4.95" on the screen. It was a terrifying score, one that made him feel an impulse to fall to his knees, and a score that a student from Songyang High School should never have been able to achieve.

His pair of rhinoceros-like ears twitched rapidly. "How did he do it? Did Purple Cloud or Red Pagoda help him? But he shows no physical signs of their new technologies."

"Could it be…"

Chu Qiuhe subconsciously glanced in Yu Xinghan's direction.

If there was a single competitor among the three major high schools who showed no signs of any new technology, it was this disciple of a Golden Core master.

"Did Zhang Yu receive our White Dragon High School's body tempering technology? And has he already achieved the same level of physical control as Yu Xinghan?"

"Is… is that even possible?"

Chu Qiuhe shook his head, dismissing the guess. Neither the Immortal Resonance Group nor the Oasis Group had any such plans, and it was even more impossible for Zhang Yu to possess an aptitude that could rival Yu Xinghan's.

So, after eliminating all other possibilities, Chu Qiuhe arrived at the only remaining one: "Songyang High School's body tempering technology has also had a breakthrough?"

…

On the other side.

In the Purple Cloud High School rest area, Lian Tianji gazed at the score on the big screen and lamented internally, "He wasn't lying? His physical strength is really level 4.95?"

If someone like that came to Purple Cloud High School, he would be another powerhouse capable of using him as a stool.

"How did he do it? Which company is backing him?"

"Could it be… Songyang High School has also mastered a new body tempering technology?"

Lian Tianji's gaze suddenly shifted to Le Mulan beside him. _The venerable number one has been keeping an eye on Zhang Yu for a while. Did she see how extraordinary he was from the start? As expected of the top student in our grade; her intelligence network and judgment of character are far superior to mine._

…

Meanwhile.

In the Songyang High School rest area.

He Dayou, who had just completed his own physical strength test, shot to his feet, staring in disbelief at Zhang Yu's score.

"4.95?!"

The score wasn't just high; in He Dayou's eyes, it was absurdly high. He suspected that 4.95 might very well be the highest physical strength level among all the competitors in the entire event.

He looked at Zhang Yu, his face a mask of envy and jealousy, and thought, _Could Zhang Pianpian have secretly supported Zhang Yu with White Dragon High School's technology?_

_Even if she didn't, she must have poured an insane amount of money into him._

_What exactly is the relationship between Zhang Yu and Zhang Pianpian? A mother investing in her son… no, even a daughter paying off her father's debts wouldn't throw money around this recklessly!_

Wang Hai, who was also in the Songyang High rest area watching the competition, was equally stunned. "What just happened?"

In the next few moments, his phone rang several times in succession.

He found himself explaining to the school's leadership on the other end of the line, "No, I really don't know anything about a new technology."

"Zhang Yu hardly ever trained with me."

"I have no idea how he got his level to 4.95."

…

In the stands.

Lan Ling stared at the score, both shocked and furious. He turned to Zhou Chechen.

"How could that poor bastard Zhang Yu get this far? Did he undergo White Dragon's surgery?"

Zhou Chechen frowned. "I haven't heard anything about that, but…"

Thinking about the timing of Oasis Group's arrival in Songyang City, recalling Zhang Pianpian's investment in Zhang Yu, and then considering Zhang Yu's almost unbelievable improvement in physical strength…

Zhou Chechen's expression slowly darkened. "Could it be that Zhang Pianpian knew all along about the Oasis Group partnership and the coming breakthroughs in the three major high schools' body tempering technology? Is that why she set things up on Songyang's side?"

"But what is her objective?"

Zhou Chechen couldn't figure it out at the moment, but that didn't stop the sight of Zhang Yu on the field from becoming increasingly irritating.

He took a deep breath. "Whatever her goal is, it's already mid-April. In less than two months, Zhang Pianpian has the college entrance exams, and then university interviews…"

…

At the back of the stands.

One moment, Le Jingchen had been introducing Purple Cloud High School's super-metabolism surgery. The next, Zhang Yu's score of 4.95 left him momentarily speechless.

However, as a professional influencer, Gang Shan reacted quickly. "This student from Songyang High School must have used a new body tempering technology as well, right?"

Le Jingchen nodded decisively. "Without a doubt. Without using the latest body tempering technology, it's impossible to reach a physical strength of 4.95 at this stage of the first year just by relying on alchemical enhancers and acupuncture."

"This student from Songyang High has definitely used some new technology, and his body has been modified."

Seeing that Zhang Yu's skin was neither dark nor purplish, and that he displayed no demonic beast characteristics, Le Jingchen guessed internally, _Has Songyang High also mastered some new technology?_

Le Jingchen didn't jump to conclusions, deciding instead to carefully observe the performance of the other Songyang High students.

Just then, Gang Shan sighed. "This wave of developments in new body tempering technology is truly astonishing. Even a student from Songyang High has reached a level that far surpasses previous champions."

Le Jingchen set aside his thoughts and chimed in, "That's the nature of progress in the Immortal Dao. It always benefits society, allowing more and more people to walk further down the path of cultivation."

Gang Shan asked curiously, "A physical strength of 4.95 is terrifying for a first-year. There can't be anyone here with a higher score, can there?"

Le Jingchen shook his head with a chuckle. "4.95 is indeed impressive, but it's still a bit lacking compared to the top students from the three major high schools who have been enhanced with the latest body tempering technologies."

Shortly after Le Jingchen spoke, a terrifying dragon's roar echoed from the competition floor, causing countless spectators' faces to pale and their hearts to race as an instinctual fear washed over them.

And the name at the top of the big screen had changed again.

Red Pagoda High School, Hu Yuntao, 4.98.

But before the crowd could fully express their amazement at Hu Yuntao's score, another, deeper and more majestic beastly roar resounded, pushing him down to second place.

White Dragon High School, Song Hailong, 5.03.

Gang Shan exclaimed, "School has only been in session for just over seven months, and his physical strength has already broken level 5?"

He shook his head with a wry smile. "The times are truly changing."

As if in response to Gang Shan's remark, the scores on the big screen changed again and again as more students from the three major high schools completed their tests.

The top spot, in particular, was contested fiercely.

Song Hailong had just claimed first place with a 5.03, only to be supplanted moments later by Xiong Wenwu's 5.05.

But Xiong Wenwu's 5.05 didn't hold for long before Yu Xinghan seized the top spot with a 5.07.

Once Yu Xinghan took first place, his position remained unshakable, and the entire top-ten list gradually began to solidify.

But while the vast majority of the audience and staff were captivated by the performance of the top students from the three major high schools, marveling at their ever-increasing physical strength.

Le Jingchen's attention was fixed on the fifth and seventh places.

Fifth Place, Songyang High School, Zhang Yu, 4.95.

Seventh Place, Songyang High School, Bai Zhenzhen, 4.92.

_Songyang High School… they really have mastered a new body tempering technology?_ Le Jingchen thought.

_Hmph… so they deliberately sacrificed the second-year competition to feign weakness, all so they could make a stunning debut at today's first-year competition and promote their new technology?_

_Are they trying to usurp the position of the three major high schools?_

_Heh, quite ambitious. I really underestimated you._

Although he knew the collective strength of the top students from the three major high schools was more than enough to crush the others.

The thought that the latter half of the top ten might be infiltrated by this Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen filled Le Jingchen with a sense of disgust.

It felt like watching a poor person enter Purple Cloud High School without being disinfected, like a pristine tabletop being sullied by a dirty hand.

Just then, Gang Shan asked curiously, "Jingchen, that Le Mulan from Purple Cloud is your sister, right? Her performance seems a little lackluster. What are your thoughts?"

Sixth Place, Purple Cloud High School, Le Mulan, 4.93.

Le Jingchen smiled faintly and explained with composure, "Purple Cloud's super-metabolism technology primarily focuses on enhancing the body's drug resistance. This allows a cultivator to increase their physical strength more easily and rapidly, but it also leads to an issue."

"That is, raw physical strength alone cannot fully represent their true combat potential."

Gang Shan asked, "True combat potential?"

Le Jingchen elaborated, "Naturally, it refers to their performance after their usual regimen of alchemical enhancers."

Gang Shan nodded slightly. They were all people who used enhancers daily, so of course 'true combat potential' referred to their strength under the influence of their regular doses.

Le Jingchen continued, "Although Le Mulan's physical strength appears to be 4.93, because she can handle more potent alchemical enhancers on a daily basis, her true combat potential is actually far greater. When she really exerts herself, she can perform at a level comparable to someone with a physical strength of 5.05."

"And that is something a simple physical strength test can't measure."

"But once they reach a bottleneck, say at the peak of the Qi Refining stage where both competitors have a physical strength of 10, the one who has undergone the super-metabolism surgery will undoubtedly perform better."

"If you don't believe me," Le Jingchen said with utter confidence, "just watch the upcoming events. Le Mulan will definitely place in the top three."

…

At the same time, Wang Hai's phone was about to explode from the sheer volume of calls.

Zhou Chechen was also being bombarded with one inquiry after another.

"No, Principal! We really haven't had a technological breakthrough."

"Uncle, you should know my situation. I haven't even undergone the surgery myself, so how could I give it to some poor first-year?"

"Auntie, please help me contact Purple Cloud Supplements. I have no intention of breaching our contract. We haven't made any deals with other companies…"

Hanging up, thoroughly exasperated, Zhou Chechen shot a furious glare toward the Songyang High School rest area.

"Zhang Yu… Bai Zhenzhen… just which company did Zhang Pianpian sell them out to?"

Amidst the noise and chaos, as opinions and rumors about companies, high schools, and competitors began to ripple out from the venue, the physical strength test finally concluded. The second event of the athletics meet was about to begin.
