# Chapter 641: Modification

Zhang Yu had long harbored ideas for modifying the Seven Absolutes Bionic.

However, ever since joining the Artifact Refinement Department to compete in the Ten Greats League, Zhang Yu had been relentlessly pursuing military-grade Power, leaving him no spare time. Until today, he had lacked the opportunity, time, and resources to modify the Seven Absolutes Bionic.

Fortunately, with the school's support — a formidable team of seven Nascent Soul True Monarchs from the Artifact Refinement Department — Zhang Yu could finally unleash his full potential and begin the modification process.

After ending his call with True Monarch Tranquility, Zhang Yu retrieved the Seven Absolutes Bionic blueprints from his Bionic Eye.

He also accessed blueprints he had purchased from the Great Library, all of which contained valuable reference material for modifying the Seven Absolutes Bionic.

"First, I'll use the Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart to fuse the blueprints and unlock the Seven Absolutes Bionic's full potential."

"Then, I'll use the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology to refine the blueprints, guiding the Seven Absolutes Bionic toward the form I envision."

If the Spirit Resonance Artifact Heart's blueprint fusion was like scattering a vast field of seeds and fully activating their potential to yield a variety of fruits, both excellent and flawed, then Zhang Yu's subsequent use of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology was akin to selecting the finest, most desirable fruits and crafting them into the perfect dish he desired.

As blueprints generated, transformed, were discarded, and refined... Zhang Yu's Spirit Inspiration rapidly depleted, and his dao heart began to falter.

In a laboratory at Myriad Laws University, True Monarch String Tone was overseeing an artifact refinement experiment.

Suddenly, True Monarch Tranquility's projection materialized before him, saying, "True Monarch String Tone, the university has a mission requiring your full cooperation. Please set aside all current tasks immediately."

True Monarch String Tone frowned. "I understand. Give me three days to complete this set of experiments."

True Monarch Tranquility replied sternly, "I apologize, True Monarch String Tone, but this matter is of critical importance and requires immediate action. You must drop everything and proceed with the mission at once."

Hearing this, True Monarch String Tone protested, "What mission is so urgent? Do you realize how many Spirit Coins I've already invested in this experiment? Abruptly halting it would waste all those resources..."

True Monarch Tranquility offered no explanation, simply displaying a notice from the Soul Transformation Divine Monarch. "This is the Principal's order."

"If you cannot halt your current experiments, suspend other projects instead."

"In any case, within three hours, you must allocate at least one Incarnation's power to this mission."

With a sigh, True Monarch String Tone said helplessly, "I hope this matter is truly as urgent as you claim."

Moments later, True Monarch String Tone arrived at a Spirit Realm Conference Room.

Upon entering, he noticed that six other True Monarchs were already present: True Monarch North Sea, True Monarch Silent Abyss, True Monarch Ember Lamp, True Monarch Dawnlight, and two others.

True Monarch String Tone's heart sank at the sight. "What could possibly require summoning so many Nascent Soul experts from the Artifact Refinement Department at once?"

The Nascent Souls exchanged glances, and a flurry of information passed back and forth through the Spirit Realm.

"Why are you all here? Do you know what's going on? Is war about to break out?"

"I heard the higher-ups are preparing for a conflict, but surely they wouldn't send us to the front lines, would they?"

"Perhaps they're developing some secret weapon."

"Could it be that the Heavenly Demons or Netherworld have developed some technology they want us to decipher together?"

As the seven Nascent Souls continued their private exchanges, their confusion deepened. Just then, True Monarch Tranquility's figure materialized again, addressing the group: "I've summoned you all here for a single purpose: to modify a set of Bionics."

"What you see before you are the original and revised design blueprints for the Seven Absolutes Bionic."

"This Bionic has not yet been publicly released, so please refrain from sharing this information."

True Monarch String Tone frowned upon seeing the name "Seven Absolutes Bionic." His frown deepened further when he noticed the design blueprint was for the Foundation Establishment Realm version.

"You summoned all seven of us here just for a Foundation Establishment Realm corporate-grade Bionic?"

At that moment, not only True Monarch String Tone but all the Nascent Soul True Monarchs present felt a surge of dissatisfaction.

However, as they continued to study the design blueprint, their initial displeasure gradually transformed into surprise and astonishment.

"This style..."

"Was this designed by Magnetic Pole? Is she the project leader?"

"Hiss... If these modifications are implemented, is this being upgraded to military-grade?"

After a long silence, once True Monarch Tranquility observed that the Nascent Soul True Monarchs had nearly finished reviewing the blueprints, he continued, "Esteemed True Monarchs, the Seven Absolutes Bionic we will be modifying next is the one currently equipped by Student Yu Zhang of the Artifact Refinement Department."

"This project is the university's support for Zhang Yu's outstanding performance in the Ten Greats League. It concerns the honor of Myriad Laws, and the Principal attaches great importance to it. I urge you all to approach this task with utmost diligence."

True Monarch String Tone thought to himself, "For the Ten Greats League? No wonder Magnetic Pole was invited to design it... Wait, she's been in seclusion for ages. This Bionic must have been designed long ago."

"Magnetic Pole probably wasn't thinking about the Ten Greats League at all. She likely prepared these design blueprints for her own disciple long ago."

Realizing this, True Monarch String Tone felt an even deeper sense of True Monarch Magnetic Pole's regard for Zhang Yu.

The university's decision to assign seven Nascent Soul True Monarchs to modify Zhang Yu's Bionic further underscored the institution's unwavering support for him.

With this understanding, the seven Nascent Soul True Monarchs present straightened their postures, their expressions growing even more serious and focused.

True Monarch Tranquility, seeing that all seven Nascent Soul True Monarchs had agreed to cooperate, breathed a small sigh of relief. He then summoned Zhang Yu and the True Monarchs to discuss the project plan.

Although Zhang Yu had completed the new design blueprint for the Seven Absolutes Bionic using his two Dao Seeds and the combined knowledge of himself and True Monarch Magnetic Pole, he lacked experience in coordinating multi-person artifact refinement, managing large-scale projects, and fully understanding many of the advanced technologies incorporated into the design.

However, the seven True Monarchs present were all seasoned experts in these areas.

With their proactive cooperation, they quickly formed seven specialized working groups based on their respective expertise and each took charge of modifying one of the seven components of the Seven Absolutes Bionic.

Zhang Yu watched as they skillfully rented a temporary accelerated conference room in the Spirit Realm, established a Spirit Realm work group, and observed assistants and students expertly drafting project plans, organizing design documents, and dividing tasks among the teams.

This display of proficiency, stability, and efficiency filled Zhang Yu with a sense of reassurance.

"Truly, these are the elite of the Artifact Refinement Department. Modifying these Bionics is practically child's play for them."

"Completing the Seven Absolutes Bionic's modifications before the war with Tian Shengong begins should be no problem at all."

After withdrawing from the Spirit Realm, Zhang Yu closed his eyes and immersed himself in the medicinal bath.

This bath, specially requested from the school, was similar to the one Dao Qiankun had prepared for him earlier, designed to rapidly restore his dao heart.

In addition, the air was permeated with the calming fragrance of Tranquil Spirit Incense, soothing Zhang Yu's mind and stabilizing his spirit and will.

Continuous use of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology had directly degraded his dao heart to level 18, severely impairing his control over his own power and significantly weakening his overall strength.

In the following days, Zhang Yu focused on three things: daily medicinal baths to restore his dao heart, monitoring the ongoing modifications to the Seven Absolutes Bionic, and controlling the Heavenly Sun Radiance God in his laboratory to maintain and repair various magical artifacts in preparation for the next battle.

However, he couldn't stay in the medicinal bath 24/7. During the times he couldn't soak, Zhang Yu would return to Dao Qiankun's Spirit Hall, keeping vigil over Brother Dao's corpse and the Dao Seed.

After several days, Zhang Yu finally saw the Dao Seed, motionless and no longer fading, resting before Dao Qiankun's body.

"Immortal Descendant."

Zhang Yu smiled as he gazed at the Dao Seed, focusing intently on sensing its replication requirements.

While Zhang Yu diligently prepared for his next battle, Tian Shengong of Immortal Armaments University was equally busy in his own laboratory.

Adjusting his Bionic, refining his magical artifacts, devising combat strategies for the upcoming battle, and manufacturing the puppets he would need — Tian Shengong felt his mind was constantly overflowing with tasks.

Unlike Zhang Yu's rented Flying Boat laboratory, Tian Shengong's laboratory was located within the Aerial Fortress formed by his Giant Puppet, allowing him to work at any time, even during combat.

However, as Tian Shengong worked in his laboratory today, his mind kept wandering, plagued by a jumble of fragmented memories.

"These memories..." Tian Shengong frowned. "They don't belong to my current self. Perhaps..."

Just as Tian Shengong was pondering this, a connection notification appeared in his Bionic Eye — it was time for his scheduled livestream with Zhang Yu.

Although his laboratory work and the mysterious memories were important, earning money and cultivating through livestreaming remained paramount on the path of the Immortal Dao.

Tian Shengong opened his livestream and quickly spotted Zhang Yu in the Spirit Hall, leaning against Dao Qiankun's livestream setup.

Without hesitation, Tian Shengong demanded, "I heard you look down on Extreme Tiger?"

Zhang Yu quickly retorted, "I never said I look down on Extreme Tiger. I just said it's cheap, affordable, and suitable for Junior College Students and monsterfolk."

Tian Shengong cursed inwardly, "You fucking idiot... even if it's true, you can't just blurt it out like that!"

Whether admitting Extreme Tiger's affordability or discussing its suitability for Junior College Students and monsterfolk, Tian Shengong felt he was treading through a minefield.

Forcing himself to ignore Zhang Yu's words, Tian Shengong launched into a tirade: "Fuck! @#¥%!"

"Looking down on Extreme Tiger is looking down on Immortal Armaments University, on everyone who uses Extreme Tiger!"

"Did Myriad Dao pay you off? Or Vajra Profound Creation? Are you here to sabotage Extreme Tiger?"

"Extreme Tiger focuses on performance and practicality, never resorting to brand inflation like Myriad Paths Artisan Sect or Vajra Profound Creation. They're just threatened by Extreme Tiger's rise, afraid their own overpriced products will lose their edge, so they hired you to smear Extreme Tiger's name..."
