# Chapter 761: Dao Lineage, a New Atmosphere in the Sect

As Yu Xinghan granted the permissions requested by the Myriad Laws Steward one by one, the installation progress bar before him quickly reached 100%.

Installation complete. With a mere thought, Yu Xinghan summoned the Myriad Laws Steward's interface before him.

Staring at the "Begin Self-Check" button on the interface, Yu Xinghan was about to press it when a thought struck him. He turned to the training teacher and asked, "Teacher, does this self-check cost anything?"

The training teacher replied casually, "No, it's free. Just use it. Send me the report as soon as it's generated."

"Oh, and besides the self-check, generate the annual report and send that to me as well."

"Free again?" Yu Xinghan's heart jolted with renewed shock. He couldn't help but sigh in admiration, "The sect... is truly benevolent."

With a mental command, the "Begin Self-Check" button before him pulsed slightly, and lines of his physical data began to appear.

At the same time, a notification asking whether to generate the annual report popped up. Following the teacher's instructions, Yu Xinghan selected "Yes."

The next moment, not only his physical data but also his academic records and work history from the lower layers were integrated into the report, line by line.

From basic stats to the cultivation progress of every part of his body, the various cultivation arts he had mastered, and even judgments based on his work performance...

"Over the past year, you have completed 3,000 part-time seed production sessions, with a total volume exceeding 20,000 milliliters—enough to fill twenty medicine jars."

"This year, your fastest production time was a mere 0.21 seconds, with an annual average of 5 seconds, far surpassing 89% of individuals and rivaling the monsterfolk."

"Remember December 2nd? It must have been a special day. During a 24-hour overtime shift, you completed 98 consecutive shipments."

"Throughout the entire month of June, you did not undertake a single seed production part-time job. Was something troubling you?"

Reading through the annual report's summary of his achievements over the past year, including his annual keyword "Part-Time," Yu Xinghan sighed with satisfaction. This was proof of his diligent overtime, a medal for his work performance.

After reviewing the cultivation art section, he breathed a small sigh of relief. "The Dharma-Warding Talisman really works. None of my pirated cultivation arts were detected."

But as he continued reading, he was shocked to discover just how many problems his body had.

"Flaws in my breathing technique's circulation, underdeveloped meridians and muscles? Side effects from inferior cultivation arts..."

With a thought, an Immortal Dao Optimization List materialized before Yu Xinghan. If he agreed, the Myriad Laws Steward could fine-tune various aspects of his cultivation.

For example, Breathing Technique Optimization would allow his various breathing techniques to operate autonomously with unparalleled precision and efficiency under the Dharma Realm's control.

Then there was Cultivation Optimization. Based on his existing data, it could recommend superior training methods for every inch of his meridians, muscles, and even his Dantian and Golden Core.

There was also Cultivation Art Tuning. If he enabled the cultivation art download function, he could directly jump to the purchase page for recommended arts and, after downloading, initiate fully automated, managed cultivation.

And Low-Level Cultivation Art Cleanup. This feature could perform a dual cleanup of both his body and memory, eliminating the negative effects caused by conflicts between low-level and high-level cultivation arts.

As Yu Xinghan scanned the subsequent features — Customized Medicine, Bionic Optimization, and more — he was profoundly shaken.

He couldn't help but look at the world of the Kunxu Eleventh Layer, then at the Myriad Laws Steward before him, sighing inwardly. "Such cultivation conditions, such cultivation tools... The gap between inside and outside the sect is just too vast."

Although letting the Dharma Realm circulate his cultivation arts and adjust his physical body for him felt a little unsettling, Yu Xinghan understood that after entering the sect, he couldn't avoid using such functions forever. So, he selected Breathing Technique Optimization, the only free optimization item on the densely packed list.

In an instant, Yu Xinghan felt his Magic Power surge into motion, erupting like a storm that frantically drew in vast amounts of spiritual energy from the surrounding world.

According to the Myriad Laws Steward's display, he saw his Magic Power enhancement efficiency increase by 1.8 times in the blink of an eye.

He was startled. "Is this... because the environment has changed? Were my breathing habits and techniques from the lower layers already unsuitable for the Sect Layer? The Myriad Laws Steward just optimized them for me, allowing me to finally benefit from the sect's cultivation environment..."

At the same time, Yu Xinghan could feel waves of spiritual energy ripple from the others around him. Clearly, they had also completed their Breathing Technique Optimization, significantly boosting their cultivation efficiency.

Yu Xinghan sighed inwardly, "Just by coming to the entrance and connecting to the Dharma Realm for a check-up, our cultivation efficiency has already increased significantly. And the key thing is... all of this was actually free?"

"So this is a sect?"

"Indeed, to climb to the Apex of the Immortal Dao, one must join a sect."

Just then, the optimization list reappeared before Yu Xinghan.

At the top of the list, it read: "You can optimize the following aspects of your Immortal Dao cultivation."

Below that, it stated: "After completing all optimizations, your estimated Immortal Dao cultivation efficiency will increase by over 500%."

At the very bottom was a section titled "Your friends are using," followed by the avatars of Zhang Yu, True Monarch Starfire, and others.

Yu Xinghan wasn't surprised by this at all; in fact, it felt more normal. The continuous free services had been making him a little uneasy.

To be honest, it was impossible for Yu Xinghan to say he didn't want to continue optimizing. But poverty held him back.

Glancing at his Immortal Coin balance of zero, Yu Xinghan silently closed the subsequent list of paid optimizations.

When a loan advertisement popped up, he silently closed that too, thinking, "Now is not the time. Borrowing potential shouldn't be used lightly; it must be saved for critical moments."

Meanwhile, the training teacher had collected everyone's reports. He sent out a group invitation and pulled everyone present into the chat.

Yu Xinghan looked at the long list of student names and felt a slight surprise. "Could it be that all the newly recruited Sect Staff from the various layers of the Myriad Laws Sect are here for newcomer training?" he wondered.

However, the entire group was currently muted. After Yu Xinghan and the others joined, they saw no messages being sent.

Following the arrows that appeared within the Dharma Realm, the group proceeded. Zhang Yu, Yu Xinghan, and True Monarch Starfire, as Sect Staff, headed to one side. Ye Xingli, Le Mulan, and Li Xuelian, as accompanying outsourced personnel, went to another area for their training.

Soon, Yu Xinghan's trio arrived at a massive conference room.

Upon entering, they found it already filled with people, who had formed small circles and were chatting amongst themselves.

Looking at these sect disciples, Yu Xinghan noticed that the vast majority of them conformed to classical aesthetics, a style he himself appreciated.

"Finally... we're about to meet the natives of the Sect Layer."

"They'll look down on us, won't they?" Yu Xinghan thought. "These guys were born and raised in the Sect Layer and only got into the sect through incredibly fierce competition... How could they possibly respect us?"

In that moment, Yu Xinghan could already picture it: he, Zhang Yu, and True Monarch Starfire being scorned and mocked, relegated to the bottom of the pecking order in the newcomer training class. They would be trampled underfoot, becoming the laughingstock of the entire class, the butt of everyone's jokes. In the end, they could only endure silently, biding their time and slowly climbing their way up...

Just then, a cultivator with the appearance of a young girl, dressed in classical robes, walked toward them.

Watching her approach, Yu Xinghan steeled himself. "Bring it on. Now that I've entered the sect, I'm prepared. No matter how many times they insult me, I can take it!"

But in the next instant, the girl-like cultivator spoke with surprising warmth. "Hello! Are you the candidates from the lower layers?"

At the same time, another cultivator leaned in, his face full of concern. "It must have been tough getting accepted, right?"

Another cultivator added kindly, "You probably don't know much about the Sect Layer. Just ask us if you need anything."

"You don't have any Immortal Coins yet, do you? Want me to lend you some?"

"You guys, back off a bit! Don't scare them..."

One of the female cultivators, named Fang Jieyi, looked at Yu Xinghan with genuine kindness and said, "You must have endured so much hardship to get here from the lower layers. You poor thing... Do you want to be my little brother? I'll take care of you..."

Staring at the friendly and approachable Sect Scions before him, Yu Xinghan was once again stunned. "An illusion! Did I fall into an Illusionary Realm when I entered? How could Sect Scions possibly treat me with such respect?"

Just then, True Monarch Starfire stepped in front of Yu Xinghan and smiled at Fang Jieyi. "No need to trouble yourself. We can take care of ourselves."

Fang Jieyi glanced at True Monarch Starfire and smiled faintly. "Life isn't easy for people from the lower layers up here. If you run into any trouble, feel free to find me anytime. Sect disciples should look out for each other, it's only right."

As the crowd of Sect Scions dispersed, the light and shadows before them shifted, and the first lesson of the newcomer training began.

A figure appeared on the stage and looked at the crowd, saying, "My name is Yun Jiying, your Lending Teacher."

"Wait... what kind of teacher?" Zhang Yu's heart jolted. "A Lending Teacher?"

Yun Jiying's voice rang out clearly as she said, "The path of the Immortal Dao is long. Who dares claim to be without debt? Who dares say they will never borrow?"

"Having cultivated to your current realms, you must already have your own understanding of the Dao of Lending."

"You should also understand that stronger Immortal Dao talent grants you a higher lending limit."

"The fact that you fought your way through countless contenders to successfully join the sect and become Sect Staff already proves your talent and potential. You are now qualified for a higher limit."

"Now, install the Dharma Link Exchange in your Dharma Realms and show me your potential!"

The Dharma Link Exchange was the largest lending platform under the Myriad Laws Sect, allowing direct borrowing of Immortal Coins and even various Immortal Dao powers through the Dharma Realm.

Following Yun Jiying's command, the trainees began to display their potential.

"I can borrow Soul Transformation cultivation for 3 minutes!"

"I can borrow Soul Transformation cultivation for 5 minutes and 32 seconds."

"I got 23 minutes!"

Watching the trainees display their lending limits, Yun Jiying nodded in satisfaction. "Your batch has quite good potential. As you've likely noticed, now that you're Sect Staff, those at the Golden Core Realm can borrow Nascent Soul cultivation."

"Those at the Nascent Soul Realm can borrow Soul Transformation cultivation."

"This is the privilege of being Sect Staff. By successfully joining the sect, you can borrow cultivation across realms."

Zhang Yu checked his own limit and thought, "Soul Transformation cultivation borrowing time... 3 seconds."

Though it was a mere three seconds, Zhang Yu understood that with this brief burst of Soul Transformation cultivation, he could accomplish an unimaginable amount of work that would normally take a Nascent Soul Cultivator much longer.

He marveled inwardly, "Becoming Sect Staff not only provides excellent cultivation conditions but also allows us to wield power across realms, giving Golden Core cultivators the potential to defeat Nascent Soul cultivators, and Nascent Soul cultivators the chance to challenge Soul Transformation experts."

Of course, Zhang Yu knew such challenges would only work if a Sect Staff member fought a non-Sect Staff member. Otherwise, both sides could borrow power across realms.

Besides borrowing cultivation, the Dharma Link Exchange also allowed for borrowing Immortal Coins.

At this very moment, a Cultivator's aura surged explosively as layers of power from the Dharma Realm poured into his body.

This transformation instantly reversed his middle-aged appearance, which had been worn down by overwork and attrition, restoring him to a vibrant, youthful state.

He had borrowed Immortal Coins, immediately purchased and downloaded an Immortal Sect-level Longevity Art, and instantly broke through to Level 1, adding ten years to his lifespan.

Yun Jiying nodded slightly and said, "Excellent. Directly purchasing and downloading Immortal Sect Techniques is another privilege you gain as Sect Staff after joining the sect. It's a good use for borrowed Immortal Coins."

"However, truly powerful cultivation arts require not only Immortal Coins but also Dao Merit to purchase..."

Zhang Yu knew that Immortal Coins were the most widely circulated currency within the Sect Layer, while Dao Merit was a special currency unique to the Myriad Laws Sect. Many of the sect's exclusive resources could only be bought with Dao Merit.

Just then, the trainee who had broken through on the spot asked in surprise, "Teacher, this bill... why can it be gambled?"

Hearing the trainee's question, Yun Jiying smiled faintly. "This is another new benefit of becoming Sect Staff."

"Heavenly Fortune Immortal Venerable, sensing the hardships of the Immortal Dao and the lack of opportunities for cultivators to stake their all, seeks to establish a new Dao Lineage, allowing everyone in the world to take a gamble."

"This blessing begins with the Sect Staff. In the future, all your bills, all your payments, all your loans... can be gambled."

"If your luck is good, the payment is waived entirely. If your luck is bad, the bill doubles and the interest skyrockets."

"As the Dao Lineage is gradually established, everyone will have the chance to find life in death, to stake everything against Heaven..."

Listening to Yun Jiying's words, Zhang Yu cursed inwardly, "What bullshit Dao Lineage... Isn't this just turning everyone in the world into gambling addicts?"

Dao Lineage was a concept Zhang Yu had only gradually come to understand while studying for the Sect Examination.

In his understanding, it seemed to be a set of rules that only Immortals could establish. For example, reincarnation was the Dao Lineage of the Reincarnation Immortal Emperor.

But after recovering Immortal Slayer's memories and communicating with him, Zhang Yu learned more about the inner workings of Dao Lineages.

"The purpose of creating a Dao Lineage... is often to achieve an absolute monopoly over an Immortal Dao Technology."

"Through Immortal Dao Technology, a rule is gradually embedded into a social region, then slowly spreads throughout Kunxu, eventually becoming a fundamental law of the Heavenly Dao's operation. This grants the master of this law an absolute monopoly."

Immortal Slayer had sighed inwardly, "The embryonic form of a Dao Lineage is often related to Personal Edicts. One must at least break through to the Void Refinement Realm and establish their own Personal Edict within the current laws of Kunxu. Only then can they gradually develop this edict into their own Dao Lineage, making it a part of the world's fundamental rules."

At that time, Zhang Yu couldn't help but ask, "Can you establish any kind of Dao Lineage you want?"

Immortal Slayer replied, "Theoretically, yes. But in reality... from the very beginning, your Personal Edict must belong to the legal system of one of the Ten Great Sects. Any Dao Lineage you establish in the future must also be subordinate to the Dao Lineages of the Ten Immortal Emperors, becoming one of their Subordinate Dao Lineages. Only by being completely restricted and controlled can you avoid being targeted."

In the classroom, Zhang Yu watched the student who had just broken through. A look of ecstatic joy suddenly appeared on the student's face.

"I won the bet! It's free! They waived my bill! Hahahaha, I just got 10 years of lifespan for free!"

Watching him laugh uproariously, the surrounding students also felt their hearts stir with temptation.

Yun Jiying sighed with admiration, "The Heavenly Fortune Immortal Venerable is truly benevolent."

However, Zhang Yu had no intention of trying this himself. Not only did he refuse to gamble, but he also knew that all services in the Dharma Realm involving rapid cultivation, such as downloading or invoking cultivation arts, involved modifying a cultivator's memories.

Even though he had already mastered the Underworld Soul-Washing Scripture, Zhang Yu had no desire to let the Dharma Realm tamper with his memories.

Just then, a bill materialized directly in front of Zhang Yu, making him blink in surprise. "When did I spend any money?"

When he read the contents of the bill, he couldn't help but sigh softly. "Dharma Realm data fees?"

Zhang Yu suddenly understood. "Although I only used the free functions of the Myriad Laws Steward... I still used the Dharma Realm's channels. The data fees for that aren't free."

Staring at the outstanding balance on the bill, Zhang Yu could only sigh helplessly, knowing this was an unavoidable expense.

On the other side, Yu Xinghan had also received a bill from the Dharma Realm. He glanced at the gambling button at the bottom of the bill, knowing that with a bit of luck, he could have the entire charge waived.

But he simply shook his head and silently closed the bill.

During the Lending Class, Yun Jiying guided the students in installing various lending platforms. She taught them where they could borrow Immortal Coins, cultivation, cultivation arts, lifespan, memories, and all sorts of resources. The students came to deeply understand the terrifying potential hidden within themselves.

Soon, the second class began. The male teacher who entered the room announced, "Once you join the sect, you'll be able to purchase Dharma Drugs..."

As Zhang Yu listened to the teacher's explanation, he understood that these so-called Dharma Drugs weren't actual medicine. They were an Immortal Dao technology based on the Dharma Realm, which directly adjusted the body through the Dharma Realm to achieve specific medicinal effects.

These effects included, but were not limited to, pain editing, mental stabilization, and thought acceleration...

"The most important Dharma Drug," the teacher continued, "is called the Awakening Agent."

"After taking the Awakening Agent, you can enhance and alter your cognition, entering a high cognitive state."

"In this high cognitive state, the more you suffer, the happier you become. The more you cultivate, the more excited you grow. The more you work, the more joyful you feel. You can maintain a perpetual state of focus, positivity, and happiness. Qualities like willpower, self-discipline, calmness, and composure can all be elevated to their absolute limits."

"Even if you're penniless and drowning in debt, you'll still charge forward, facing all the hardships on your Dao path with a smile..."

Zhang Yu couldn't help but ask inwardly, "This Dharma Drug... are there any side effects?"

Immortal Slayer explained, "Theoretically, Dharma Drugs aren't addictive. But in practice, once you get used to them, you can't live without them."

"The benefits are immediate. In a high cognitive state, your work efficiency and cultivation speed increase dramatically. You can face any difficulty, any hardship."

"Even if you lose everything, as long as you can take another dose of the Dharma Drug, you can keep moving forward."

"Who would ever be willing to stop?"

"For many Cultivators, Dharma Drugs are the most crucial Immortal Dao resources. They are something you must continue taking... as long as you're alive."

"Currently, more than half the members of the Myriad Laws Sect are taking Dharma Drugs. Even so... I advise against it. Once you start, you'll forever be under someone else's control."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Don't tell me this is also related to some Dao Lineage?"

Immortal Slayer replied, "You guessed correctly. Ever since that Immortal established the Dharma Laws and gradually legalized Dharma Drugs, he has been quietly promoting his own Dao Lineage. Now, this Dao Lineage has achieved initial success, and Dharma Drugs have become indispensable to countless Cultivators."

Zhang Yu couldn't help but ask, "What will happen when this Dao Lineage is fully established?"

Immortal Slayer said, "I don't know either... Perhaps taking Dharma Drugs will become a basic requirement for all life to survive? Or maybe the awakened state and high cognitive state will become as instinctual as breathing or walking?"

"Dao Lineages are far too profound. Their final form is ever-changing and beyond our comprehension. Don't dwell on it."

While Zhang Yu and Immortal Slayer were communicating, he also took the opportunity to remind Yu Xinghan and True Monarch Starfire not to take Dharma Drugs.

Although True Monarch Starfire likely already knew, Zhang Yu reminded him all the same.

As the third class began, another Teacher appeared before the crowd. He began to speak: "Within our Myriad Laws Sect, disciples have traditionally focused solely on solitary cultivation, making no progress in the Dual Cultivation Dao. But this... is now outdated."

"To maintain our competitive edge, the Sect Leader announced two years ago that we would promote the development of Dual Cultivation Technology within the Myriad Laws Sect, encouraging everyone to practice it..."

"Some Cultivators have already followed the sect's guidance and actively embraced it."

Hearing these words, Zhang Yu's mind immediately flashed to Yun Zhiguang.

The Teacher on the stage continued, "But some Cultivators remain stubborn and passively resist. The upper echelons are very displeased and have decided to establish the Dual Cultivation Support Department, specifically to guide these backward elements who refuse to progress."

"You are all new recruits who have passed the entrance exam. I hope you will fully grasp the spirit of this initiative and not become those left behind by the times..."
