# Chapter 103: The Extension of the Corporate Battlefield

Just like the martial arts competition at White Dragon High School, the athletics meet held at Purple Cloud High School was also scheduled for midnight.

However, due to Songyang High School's consistent investment in athletics, the school had arranged for a bus this time.

In the dead of night.

He Dayou, Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen, and the other two contestants, making a total of five, along with their coach Wang Hai, were riding the bus toward Purple Cloud High School.

Additionally, Qian Shen and Zhao Tianxing, as friends of Zhang Yu, had been allowed by Wang Hai to board the bus to watch the competition.

But aside from the spirited Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, the others on the bus were subdued… some were cultivating through breathing exercises, some were reading, and others were scrolling through videos on their phones. In short, they had no expectations for this athletics meet, carrying an air of just wanting to get it over with.

Of course, even when scrolling on their phones, Songyang High School students were not just watching anything.

On the screen was a woman, over four meters tall with shoulders broader than a truck, who looked like a giantess, instructing on the essentials of body tempering and promoting body tempering drugs.

Wang Hai glanced at the video the student was watching and frowned. "Watch less of these body tempering influencers. They're all fake, just trying to trick you into buying alchemical enhancers."

The student was skeptical. "Mr. Wang, she's a major influencer with tens of millions of followers. Many people have seen her in person, so she can't be fake, can she?"

Wang Hai snorted. "How could anyone in the Qi Refinement realm achieve that height and dimension just by relying on drugs? It's obviously plastic surgery, all fake and unresponsive muscle."

With the growing number of high school students and the development of the body tempering industry, a peculiar aesthetic of "taller is more beautiful, bigger is better" had naturally emerged.

Wang Hai knew that the body tempering influencers online, under intense competition, were pursuing increasingly extreme physiques.

They had even started to abandon true strength for eye-catching appearances, moving from a normal physique of two or three meters to a grotesque aesthetic of four or even five meters.

Wang Hai lamented, "A practitioner who earnestly tempers their body, relying on drugs and exercise supplemented by some modification surgeries, will find that reaching three meters tall and two meters wide is basically the limit."

"Those four-meter-tall influencers are filled with prosthetic muscles and bones. If you look closely at the injection marks on their bodies, you'll see the needle points are all wrong."

Shaking his head, Wang Hai sighed, "Every year, corporations entice young people to take out loans for plastic surgery. If they don't die on the operating table, they can become influencers hawking products. After a few years, when the surgical side effects kick in, they're replaced by new influencers."

"To earn money for their own treatment, these people will tell any lie and sell any piece of junk. You should stop watching them from now on."

How did Wang Hai know so much? It was because a former classmate of his had gone down that path. After the side effects of the surgery manifested, he exhausted his family's fortune but couldn't be cured, ultimately dying during a live broadcast. Even Wang Hai himself had been approached by a talent agency, nearly getting pulled into the world of body tempering influencers.

But after saying all this, Wang Hai was overcome by a wave of listlessness.

He was reminded of the recent breakthroughs in body tempering technology at White Dragon, Purple Cloud, and Red Pagoda.

For the past two weeks, Wang Hai had been using his connections to find out what kind of technology Oasis Group had provided to the three major high schools, and what concessions those schools had made in return.

After all, such a generational update in body tempering technology was bound to affect the entire body tempering market in Songyang City, and it would certainly have a huge impact on a top-tier coach like him.

But whether it was the three major high schools or the corporations behind them, they all maintained strict secrecy. Apart from some obvious characteristics displayed at the second-year athletics meet, the true intelligence within was beyond what a physical education teacher like him could uncover.

And the thought of that second-year athletics meet made Wang Hai's expression darken further.

He had personally witnessed at that competition how the second-year students from Songyang High School were miserably eliminated, how they were pushed out of the rankings by the sheer power of the students from the three major high schools.

Even Lan Ling, whom the school had meticulously cultivated and who had received muscle fiber transplants from third-year students early on, was trampled under the feet of the top students from the three schools.

It made him sigh inwardly that the times had changed.

As he thought of this, Wang Hai couldn't help but think of one person.

_Zhou Chechen…_

Based on his results, the vice president of the second-year Student Council should have participated in this year's second-year athletics meet.

But for some reason, Zhou Chechen was absent this time; he did not participate in the competition.

_Does Zhou Chechen know something?_

While Wang Hai was pondering, Zhang Yu, sitting not far away, was also contemplating today's athletics meet.

After learning about the breakthroughs in body tempering technology at the three major high schools, Zhang Yu had naturally asked his sister, Zhang Pianpian, who stood at the pinnacle of all high school students in Songyang City and was ranked first among the third-years at White Dragon High School.

Zhang Pianpian's words now surfaced in Zhang Yu's mind.

"This time, whether it's Oasis Group or the corporations and families behind White Dragon, Purple Cloud, and Red Pagoda, they are all placing great importance on this first-year athletics meet."

"You ask why the focus is on the first-year competition and not the other grades?"

"It's because the lower the grade, the more the influence of body tempering technology on scores outweighs the individual student's talent, and the more it highlights the differences between the technologies."

"Zhang Yu, this first-year athletics meet isn't just a competition between students. It's a competition between the Immortal Dao technologies embodied by the students, and behind those technologies, the schools and corporations."

"It's a clash of Immortal Dao technologies between the major corporations, an extension of the corporate battlefield."

"As for their attitude toward the other high schools… for the big three, it's a matter of crushing them as a matter of course."

"It is by showcasing this process of crushing you that they will advertise their advanced body tempering technology."

And now Zhang Yu recalled the question he had asked at the time.

Zhang Yu: "Sis, from the sound of it, you're not very optimistic about my chances?"

Zhang Pianpian had smiled faintly and said, "Whether I'm optimistic about you or not is unimportant. What matters is whether you truly have the strength to defeat your opponents."

At this moment, on the bus, Zhang Yu looked at his Feathered Tome. _Is this strength enough to defeat them?_

More than a month had passed since the last time he competed for a spot at Songyang High School.

In this month, with the help of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill, his True Spiritual Root, and the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, his strength had broken through repeatedly, and his body strength in particular had developed by leaps and bounds.

Dao heart: Level 4 (80%)

Mana: 43.9

Body Strength: Level 4.95

But looking at his three basic stats, Zhang Yu still felt unsatisfied, sighing inwardly that he was gradually hitting a bottleneck in his Dao heart, mana, and body strength.

_Sigh, the Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method is becoming less and less effective. The speed of my mana refinement has been slowing down recently. After this athletics meet, I must start looking for a new breathing exercise to practice._

Cultivation techniques were graded as basic, advanced, expert, military, and immortal sect, primarily based on their quality.

But no matter how good a technique was for the Qi Refinement realm, it would be useless in the Foundation Establishment realm.

The Celestial Cycle Qi-Gathering Method was a technique for the early stage of Qi Refinement. Zhang Yu's current level was already approaching that of a second-year student, so he needed to consider a technique for the middle stage of Qi Refinement.

_Next is my Dao heart. The Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art is actually sufficient to continue raising my Dao heart, but the trouble with this technique is… every practice session requires both internal and external cultivation, practicing those nine external arts."_

And it just so happened that Zhang Yu had recently been focusing on increasing his body strength, cultivating the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

This meant he had no time to practice the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art and could only continuously circulate the Desolate Ox Soul-Suppressing Mantra in his mind, causing his Dao heart's improvement to hit a bottleneck.

This was because the Desolate Ox Soul-Suppressing Mantra could only be considered an early-stage Qi Refinement technique; reaching level 5 Dao heart was pretty much its limit.

_So I still need to find a heart art that I can practice constantly in my sea of consciousness to continue raising my Dao heart._

Finally, there was his body strength.

Originally, with the assistance of his True Spiritual Root, coupled with the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill and the level 10 Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, Zhang Yu's body strength had been soaring. It was only when he gradually approached level 5.00 that the progress began to slow.

_The Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi is still effective enough; its bottleneck should be at a much higher level._

_The reason it's slowed down recently should be because over the past two months… especially this last month, my body strength has increased too quickly, and the strength of my heart hasn't kept up._

Because he relied on purely natural body tempering and used very few drugs, the growth rate of Zhang Yu's internal organs was not fast, and his heart was not enlarging as rapidly as those of the drug-reliant competitors.

_Fortunately, with the help of the True Spiritual Root, it should be soon…_

Zhang Yu could feel his heart growing stronger and more powerful these days. It should soon be able to support another breakthrough in his body strength.

_By this calculation, I should hurry up and buy a new breathing exercise and heart art after this athletics meet._

_Speaking of which, the prize money for the champion of this athletics meet has increased several times, finally reaching a full 300,000. As long as I get that 300,000…_

The thought of the 300,000 prize money made Zhang Yu slightly excited.

But the 300,000 prize also indicated the high profile of this athletics meet and the importance the major corporations placed on it. Just as Zhang Pianpian had said, the competition was bound to be unprecedentedly fierce, making Zhang Yu feel a trace of pressure.

In reality, it had only been eight months since the start of his first year, and Zhang Yu's basic stats were already approaching the average level of a second-year student at Songyang High School. This was already considered meteoric progress, and it was only when competing against the freaks from the three major high schools that he felt any pressure.

Not far away, He Dayou looked at the determined faces of Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen with confusion.

He didn't understand why, given the current situation, these two still looked so confident.

Although he hadn't been able to gauge their progress since the last monthly exam because they were always skipping class.

But in such a short amount of time, no matter how much an individual broke through… how could it possibly compare to the technological breakthroughs of the three major high schools?

Just then, the bus they were on pulled to a stop at the entrance of Purple Cloud High School.

Unlike the modern skyscrapers of White Dragon High School, Purple Cloud High School had an appearance of small bridges, flowing water, pavilions, and terraces, giving it a classical, quaint feeling.

Especially under the illumination of various gold and white lights, it appeared even more ethereal, like a realm of immortals.

The entire campus of Purple Cloud High School covered a vast area, yet there were no tall buildings to be seen.

However, being able to occupy such a large piece of land in the city and build a school that looked like a park was enough to give one a profound understanding of the immense financial power behind Purple Cloud High School.

Shortly after entering the campus, Zhang Yu and the others were led into a guest passageway.

As the receiving teacher made introductions, the passageway ahead began to spray a disinfectant.

The receiving teacher from Purple Cloud High School looked at them apologetically and said, "My apologies, this is a school rule at Purple Cloud High. All off-campus personnel must be disinfected upon entry to remove any filth."

_What the hell… Are they treating us like some kind of vermin?_ Zhang Yu was speechless. At that moment, he deeply understood that it wasn't just Le Mulan who had a cleanliness obsession; this whole damn school had one.

This wretched school was just as unreliable as White Dragon High School.

So Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen stepped forward together, looking at the teacher seriously.

Zhang Yu pointed to himself and then to the others from Songyang, saying, "I scored over 660 on the monthly exam, and I'm first in the martial competition and fourth in the Mana Competition. I'm different from them."

"At my level, I could get into White Dragon High School for free. I don't need to be disinfected, right?"

Bai Zhenzhen's eyes flickered, and she nodded in agreement. "That's right. Is there a VIP channel suitable for those of us with scores over 660?"

The receiving teacher said with an apologetic face, "I'm sorry, the school rules are absolute. All outside personnel must be disinfected, with no distinction based on scores."

_Damn it, this is even more unreliable than White Dragon High School._

In an instant, in the minds of Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, Purple Cloud High School had already hit rock bottom in their ranking of the three major high schools.

Then Bai Zhenzhen suddenly pointed to people walking down another passageway. "How come they don't need to be disinfected?"

Everyone immediately looked over and saw a group of 'monsters' in White Dragon High School uniforms walking through an adjacent passageway, with no disinfection measures in sight.

The receiving teacher from Purple Cloud High School chuckled at her words, his expression seeming to say, 'Does this even need an explanation?'

"How can that be the same?" The receiving teacher shook his head. "They are from White Dragon High School, after all. As a partner school of Purple Cloud High, they are not considered off-campus personnel."

Wang Hai spoke up. "Alright, alright, when in Rome, do as the Romans do. Since we're here, let's follow Purple Cloud High's rules. Don't delay the start of the competition."

As a veteran coach who had led teams to the three major high schools for competitions countless times over the years, Wang Hai was exceptionally experienced.

He was especially experienced in being insulted by the three major high schools, and his heart was no longer stirred by such things.

It was just that in previous years, Wang Hai could still count on his students to fight for some glory in the athletics meet, to snatch a ranking and win back some face.

_This year, however, there's no hope._

He sighed and stepped into the disinfection channel first.

# Chapter 104: A Sea of Voices

With a sigh, Wang Hai stepped into the disinfection channel, his gaze instinctively drifting toward the White Dragon students in the other lane.

As the remaining members of his team passed through the disinfection channel, their eyes were also drawn to the White Dragon contingent.

The appearance of that group was simply too eye-catching.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _Yu Xinghan looks the same as when I saw him filming that commercial._

_But Song Hailong, who's following behind him, has changed drastically…_

Besides the number on his chest and back changing from a 1 to a 2, Song Hailong’s skin now looked coarse, as if polished by rock. His limbs were far thicker than before; his forearm alone was as thick as Zhang Yu's waist. The overall impression… was as if he had transformed into a humanoid giant elephant.

But Song Hailong's transformation was relatively minor; at least he still looked human.

Looking past Song Hailong, the White Dragon students further back looked less and less human, their forms approaching that of demonic beasts.

Zhang Yu recalled the intelligence his sister, Zhang Pianpian, had given him.

"White Dragon High School's body tempering technology has indeed achieved a breakthrough. It's no longer as simple as Song Hailong's previous partial elephant muscle implants."

"They can now transform a student's muscles into imitation demonic muscle, forcibly breaking through the body's natural limits to achieve explosive growth in physical strength."

"The wealthier the student, the more imitation demonic muscle they have transformed, and the less human they appear."

"However, this imitation demonic muscle possesses a certain plasticity. If a student can fully master the power within, they can gradually retract the demonic beast features and look more and more human."

Zhang Yu stared at Yu Xinghan, who was walking at the very front, momentarily unsure if the Golden Core disciple had undergone the imitation demonic muscle surgery.

After exiting the disinfection channel, the group from Songyang High School found a rhinoceros in a White Dragon High School uniform waiting for them.

It was unmistakably a rhinoceros, from its coarse, gray-black hide and the horn-like protrusion on its forehead, to its small eyes, elongated face, and thick limbs… the creature gave the impression of a humanoid rhino.

The rhinoceros waved at Zhang Yu and greeted him, "Zhang Yu, long time no see."

"Oh, you probably don't recognize me now, do you?"

The rhinoceros smiled faintly. "It's me, Chu Qiuhe, the White Dragon High student you defeated in the last martial arts competition."

Hearing the rhinoceros speak, a look of astonishment appeared in everyone's eyes. Chu Qiuhe's current humanoid rhinoceros form was so vastly different from before that it was as if he had been completely reborn.

The reason Chu Qiuhe came to see the Songyang group was simply because he wanted to confirm one thing upon seeing their team.

And that was whether Zhang Yu, the champion of the first-year martial arts competition, was representing Songyang High School this time.

Chu Qiuhe knew he wasn't the only one curious about this; many of the students who had been defeated in the martial arts competition were looking forward to avenging their loss in this athletics meet.

Seeing that Zhang Yu was indeed on the Songyang High School team, Chu Qiuhe couldn't help but feel a flicker of anticipation.

Chu Qiuhe looked at Zhang Yu and smiled faintly. "Many people were hoping you would participate in this athletics meet…"

Just then, a loud bang erupted from the White Dragon contingent ahead.

Song Hailong had viciously driven an elbow toward Yu Xinghan's temple. Amidst a sound like a cannon blast, Yu Xinghan's head twisted a mere four or five degrees from the blow before stopping.

Then, with a sharp jerk of his head, Yu Xinghan sent Song Hailong, who was taller and two to three times his size, flying.

With a resounding thud, the tumbling Song Hailong landed steadily on his feet, an unwilling look on his face as he stared at Yu Xinghan.

Yu Xinghan, however, calmly remarked, "Not good enough, little Song. That blow had far too much killing intent. There was no sense of a sudden, covert attack. You still need more practice."

The other White Dragon students seemed unfazed by this, continuing to follow Yu Xinghan forward.

The students from Songyang High School watched this scene of internal strife with surprise.

He Dayou was shocked. _The second-ranked student dares to attack the first-ranked? Have White Dragon's school rules changed?_

Beside them, Chu Qiuhe chuckled and casually explained, "It's been like this ever since Yu Xinghan became number one."

Bai Zhenzhen frowned. "Is Song Hailong that petty? He ambushes whoever surpasses him?"

Chu Qiuhe clarified, "Big Brother Hailong isn't that petty, of course. It was Yu Xinghan who demanded it. He requires Song Hailong to attack him with full force five times every twenty-four hours, saying he wants to use it as a training method."

Chu Qiuhe said with some emotion, "As a demand from the top-ranked student, Big Brother Hailong had no choice but to accept."

"From then on, his eyes and mind have been filled with nothing but Yu Xinghan. There's no one else."

"I suspect he's constantly thinking about how to take down Yu Xinghan. He's on the verge of madness."

Shaking his head with a sigh, Chu Qiuhe clapped Zhang Yu on the shoulder and said meaningfully, "Well then, I'll see you on the field. I look forward to competing with you."

Gazing at the retreating backs of the White Dragon students, at their inhuman forms, Zhang Yu suddenly felt a sense of melancholy.

_First, Red Pagoda High School, in its pursuit of results, turned demonic beasts into people. Now, White Dragon High School, in its pursuit of greater strength, is turning people into demonic beasts._

Guided by the receiving teacher, the group walked among the pavilions and terraces of Purple Cloud High School and soon arrived at a massive indoor stadium.

The teacher introduced, "This is the largest stadium at Purple Cloud High. It's generally only used for major competitions and school-wide events."

Even before entering, they could feel the deafening roar of a crowd.

Upon entering, the first thing they felt was the brightness of day.

Unlike the midnight outside, the ceiling of the stadium was hung with what looked like numerous small suns, illuminating the entire indoor stadium as if it were noon.

The second thing they noticed was the immense size of the indoor stadium and the sheer number of people.

Unlike the dangers of the martial arts competition, this athletics meet didn't carry the risk of being beaten into bankruptcy, so almost every key high school and regular high school that could participate had come.

Within the massive arena, students and coaches were everywhere. Some were injecting drugs to warm up, some were trading alchemical enhancers, and others were being insulted by the three major high schools—a vibrant scene of Kunxu's passionate high school life unfolded before them.

Besides the competitors, Zhang Yu and the others also saw staff members on the periphery and countless spectators in the stands.

He Dayou asked, puzzled, "There are a lot of people filming."

The receiving teacher beside them explained, "They are all professional spectators invited by the sponsors of this competition. There are media reporters, influencers, and many people from various corporations."

Zhang Yu looked up and indeed saw many people in suits and ties with weary expressions. The stench of corporate overtime wafted over from a great distance; they were clearly corporate drones who regularly worked late.

Zhang Yu then looked toward the spectator stands. The largest indoor stadium at Purple Cloud High School had tens of thousands of seats, and at this moment, it was packed with people.

Aside from the students of the three major high schools, Zhang Yu also saw many figures completely wrapped up, looking like mummies or rice dumplings.

Just then, a hearty laugh rang out.

"You've finally arrived."

"Those are student spectators from other regular high schools. To prevent them from dirtying the venue, they were each given a clean suit upon entry to avoid too much contact with us from Purple Cloud High."

The newcomer was Lian Tianji of Purple Cloud High School. He nodded to the receiving teacher beside him and seamlessly took over the task of guiding the Songyang High School contestants.

Facing this major client for his clothes, Zhang Yu laughed and positioned himself behind Bai Zhenzhen, greeting him warmly, "Brother Lian, what brings you here to receive us?"

Lian Tianji replied, "I know where the rest area for Songyang High School is. Let me take you there."

On the way to the rest area, Zhang Yu saw all sorts of advertisements on the floor, walls, and billboards. He also saw numerous influencers, both large and small, filming the arena and interviewing students and corporate personnel.

They were truly influencers of all sizes, with the larger ones standing over four meters tall and the smaller ones less than two. Their follower counts were generally directly proportional to their physical size.

There were also corporate people in suits and ties walking about, constantly filming and recording something.

Feeling the deafening roar of the entire arena, Zhang Yu once again understood what Zhang Pianpian had said.

Zhang Yu murmured to himself, _This athletics meet truly is an extension of the corporate battlefield, a stage for them to promote their new technologies._

Along the way, Zhang Yu also saw many students in Purple Cloud High School uniforms, their entire bodies tinged with purple, bowing to Lian Tianji. They only resumed their activities after he was out of sight.

Zhang Yu once again recalled the intelligence from Zhang Pianpian.

"Purple Cloud High School's technological breakthrough lies in enhancing a cultivator's metabolic rate and drug resistance, allowing them to take more than ten times the amount of drugs as before. All sorts of prohibited substances can be taken as if they were routine."

"However, due to the side effects of the Purple Cloud Supplements, the more fiercely they take the drugs, the more purple drug residue remains on their skin. In other words, the more money one has to take more drugs, the more purple their entire body becomes."

"But at a more advanced stage, for those who can rapidly refine the medicinal power, the drug residue on their skin is completely broken down, leaving only a purple mark on their forehead. At this point, the more medicinal power one refines, the more complex the pattern on their forehead becomes, eventually forming a tattoo of a purple eye."

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen occasionally glanced at Lian Tianji beside them, noticing a thumb-sized purple circular mark on his forehead.

"We're here."

Lian Tianji smiled and pointed forward. "This is the rest area for Songyang High School."

Zhang Yu and the others looked up and saw an area enclosed by partitions. Not only was it fully equipped with sofas, power outlets, drinking water, and energy drinks, but there were even fruits and snacks. It once again made them feel the immense investment in this athletics meet, that even the humble Songyang contingent could receive such treatment.

# Chapter 105: Can I Touch You?

Looking at the amenities in the Songyang High School rest area, Qian Shen and Zhao Tianxing exchanged glances.

They had both been to White Dragon High School and witnessed the last martial arts competition, so the treatment of the Songyang High School rest area back then was still fresh in their minds.

Now, seeing such well-appointed facilities at the athletics meet, Zhao Tianxing suspected they might have gone to the wrong place.

Qian Shen couldn't help but think, _No way… with Songyang High School's average score, do they really rate a rest area with these kinds of conditions?_

Even Wang Hai had to admit that in all his years of leading teams to athletics meets, this was the grandest event and the best treatment Songyang High School had ever received.

Lian Tianji, standing nearby, seemed to be aware of their surprise and explained with a smile, "The on-site facilities this time are co-sponsored by Purple Cloud Supplements and Oasis Group, so the conditions are indeed excellent."

He pointed toward the east side of the arena and said, "Over there, Oasis Group and Red Pagoda Husbandry are providing a complimentary buffet for all competitors, as well as the Purple Cloud students and other staff helping out. Would you like to go and have a taste?"

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, who had just sat down, immediately stood up. "We're going to familiarize ourselves with the competition environment."

So the two of them followed Lian Tianji across the arena to the buffet area on the east side.

From a distance, they could see purple-skinned students from Purple Cloud High School holding plates and eating inside.

The reason they were holding plates was that Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen noticed these Purple Cloud students would start eating while walking as soon as they had filled their trays.

By the time these Purple Cloud students reached the exit of the buffet area, they would have finished everything and placed their trays on the dish return table.

Bai Zhenzhen's eyes lit up as she said, "I get it. These students eating while walking must be the poor performers from your school, right? Because their grades are so bad, they aren't qualified to sit down and eat. They have to finish their food while walking from the moment they get it to the moment they return their trays."

Lian Tianji chuckled. "You think too harshly of our Purple Cloud High. Our requirements for underperforming students aren't that strict. These are just the ordinary students who aren't qualified to sit and eat."

"Huh? What about the underperformers then?"

Lian Tianji said nonchalantly, "The bottom 50 students eat in the restroom. They can take as long as they want, no requirements at all."

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _These Purple Cloud High students really are devil incarnates._

But on second thought, although making the bottom 50 students eat in the restroom was a bit inhuman, on the flip side… didn't this just mean that Purple Cloud High at least had plenty of restrooms?

_In that respect, at least they're doing better than White Dragon High School,_ Zhang Yu thought.

Just then, a rumbling sound, like the thundering of ten thousand horses, echoed as a large group of black monsters in Red Pagoda High School uniforms entered the buffet area.

Zhang Yu's eyes widened in astonishment. "What the hell… are those students? Students from Red Pagoda High School?"

It wasn't that Zhang Yu had never seen the demon-kin students from Red Pagoda High before.

Although their appearances were a bit different from humans, forms like brown bears and tigers were still within the realm of normalcy.

But these creatures before him… each one was covered in an oily, smooth blackness, with only a pair of eyes glowing crimson.

He thought in shock, _My sister said that Red Pagoda High's technological breakthrough allowed their demon students to awaken the bloodline power of a black creature, which they successfully extracted and injected into the human students…_

_Could it be that they've awakened a black person's bloodline? Gaining powerful athletic abilities, which is why they've become black bears, black tigers, and… black students?_

Lian Tianji, noticing Zhang Yu's shocked expression, kindly explained, "Red Pagoda High School successfully stimulated the Black Dragon bloodline in their demon-kin students, resulting in a transformative change in their physique."

"If you look closely at their skin, the blackness is the texture reflected by dragon scales."

As Zhang Yu got closer, he could faintly discern a layer of fine black scales within the black sheen, which shimmered with an iridescent blackness.

At the same time, he noticed more black details that were hard to see from a distance.

For instance, the two small horns on Xiong Wenwu's forehead, the five sharp and slender claws on his hands, the small tail on his backside, and the long whiskers at the corners of his mouth… moreover, a heart-palpitating pressure continuously emanated from their bodies, as if predators were eyeing their prey.

Lian Tianji continued at his side, "It's said that among these demon-kin students from Red Pagoda, those who have awakened more of the Black Dragon bloodline exhibit more Black Dragon features, and their physique inherits more of the Black Dragon's traits, resulting in a more terrifying increase in body strength."

As he said this, a hint of excitement crept into Lian Tianji's tone. "In terms of body strength, these guys have a unique advantage. I'm really looking forward to competing against them."

Bai Zhenzhen urged from the side, "Are you done talking? If we don't eat now, I don't think there'll be anything left."

Indeed, within the buffet area, the students from Red Pagoda High were devouring all kinds of food like a storm sweeping away clouds. A single opening and closing of their mouths often meant an entire plate of food was swallowed into their bellies.

Zhang Yu quickly pulled Bai Zhenzhen and rushed in, grabbing a plate of food and pouring it into his mouth.

Bai Zhenzhen grabbed a handful of chicken legs, and after a few bites, tears welled up in her eyes.

For the past month, she and Zhang Yu had been eating synthetic food almost every day.

It was fine at first, but later on, she found the mush increasingly unappetizing. Her body's craving for real food had been suppressed to its absolute limit.

At this moment, actually eating a chicken leg, feeling the real chicken juices burst in her mouth, Bai Zhenzhen had only one thought: "Real roasted chicken legs are so delicious!"

After taking a sip of the beast protein milk from Red Pagoda Husbandry, the expression on Bai Zhenzhen's face became even more satisfied.

Lian Tianji walked over and sat down in front of the two, who were wolfing down their food, and said with a smile, "No need to rush. The buffet here is provided by both Oasis Group and Red Pagoda Husbandry. Even if there were ten times as many people, the supply is absolutely guaranteed."

After chatting casually with Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen for a bit, Lian Tianji finally asked a question he had been curious about for a long time.

"Zhang Yu, in these past two months, to what level has your body strength increased?"

Lian Tianji looked at Zhang Yu, who was currently stuffing steak into his mouth, and his mind seemed to flash back to the moment he was defeated by him on the martial arts stage two months ago.

He thought to himself, _Although I want to defeat you, if there's too great a gap in our body strength, then such a victory would be meaningless._

The thought that he might never be able to defeat the Zhang Yu from that time filled Lian Tianji's heart with a trace of regret.

Zhang Yu casually replied, "Level 4.95."

Lian Tianji was taken aback for a moment, then chuckled the next. "I'm not joking with you. I'm asking what your body strength is."

Zhang Yu gave Lian Tianji a strange look.

"It's level 4.95. Who's joking with you?"

After saying that, he stuffed a few more lamb chops into his mouth.

Lian Tianji's brow furrowed, and his first thought was disbelief.

_After undergoing Purple Cloud Supplements' super-metabolism modification, I've been injecting nearly ten kilograms of drugs daily._

_I've endured the constant pain of torn muscles and ruptured organs, been rushed to the emergency room several times, and even then, I've only managed to raise my body strength to level 4.56._

_How could Zhang Yu possibly be at 4.95?_

_Is he intentionally spouting nonsense, not wanting to reveal his true body strength? But what's the point? Once the competition starts, everyone's body strength will be tested and revealed._

_Could it be that he's not lying? But how is that possible?_

For a moment, Lian Tianji felt that Zhang Yu probably wasn't lying, but it was also highly unlikely that Zhang Yu wasn't lying.

Just as he was pondering this, a slender, cold, and beautiful figure silently entered the cafeteria, drawing everyone's attention.

The reason she drew attention was only partly due to her beauty; the main reason was that all the Purple Cloud students present stood up in unison and bowed to Le Mulan.

At this moment, Le Mulan had tied her long hair into a ponytail with a purple silk ribbon. She was wearing a purple tracksuit that revealed her snow-white arms and long, slender legs, exuding a rare athletic aura.

And what attracted the eyes of Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen the most was, naturally, the purple mark on her brow.

That mark was far more complex than Lian Tianji's simple dot; it looked like a purple vertical pupil imprinted on Le Mulan's forehead.

The aloof, top-ranked student nodded, her cold face devoid of expression as she said, "You may all go about your business."

Hearing her response, the bowing Purple Cloud students all returned to their previous states.

Then, Le Mulan walked straight to the table where Zhang Yu, Bai Zhenzhen, and Lian Tianji were and stopped.

Zhang Yu looked at Le Mulan, whose breathing was slightly heavy, and shrugged. "You want to eat with us? There's no seat for you though."

Le Mulan said flatly, "It's fine."

She glanced at Lian Tianji, who was occupying two seats due to his size, and said coolly, "I need a stool."

Immediately, several Purple Cloud students rushed over. The first girl to reach them dropped to the ground, positioning herself like a stool in front of Le Mulan.

_Holy crap!_ Zhang Yu thought to himself, _These Purple Cloud people… they seem even more deranged than two months ago._

The reason for Zhang Yu's curiosity was simple. It was because after Purple Cloud obtained its technological breakthrough and numerous first-year prodigies underwent the super-metabolism surgery, causing their body strengths to skyrocket… Le Mulan had defeated them all over again.

The first-year students of Purple Cloud discovered to their despair that even with the super-metabolism surgery, the gap between them and the wealthiest student in the grade, Le Mulan, had not narrowed but had instead grown even wider.

The role of wealth in cultivation and scores had once again been magnified.

And in the environment of Purple Cloud High School, this disparity had created an even more exaggerated worship of wealth and scores.

Zhang Yu sensed that Le Mulan had been occasionally glancing at him since she arrived, making him feel a bit awkward as he ate.

He thought to himself, _This woman couldn't possibly still be thinking of getting revenge on me, could she?_

Just then, Le Mulan's clear and cold voice rang out, "Can I touch you?"

Sensing the silence at the table, Le Mulan added, "I can pay."
