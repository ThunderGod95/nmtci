# Chapter 468: Breaking Through on the Spot

Zhang Yu couldn't muster even the slightest resistance. As the ethereal sensation washed over him, his consciousness gradually lost its ability to think, sinking into a half-dream state.

As his Magic Power surged, the essence of his vital energy also began to stir.

So weak, so weak, so weak! Jade Nectar Maiden Forty-Eight thought. This man is truly pathetic!

"First, I'll devour all your Magic Power."

"Come out, all of you!"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole had been observing the changes in Zhang Yu's body. When she noticed his Magic Power surging uncontrollably toward the Yin Artifact, even causing his vital energy to begin boiling, she prepared to suppress the artifact.

She knew that if this continued, once Zhang Yu's body completely lost control, the consequences would extend far beyond just Magic Power loss.

Further... his knowledge, lifespan, even memories and potential could all be devoured.

But in the very next moment, another sudden change occurred.

Zhang Yu, who had been intoxicated by the incomparably beautiful, perfect sensation, suddenly regained a sliver of clarity in his Sea of Consciousness the instant he sensed his body was about to completely lose control.

Countless hours of hard part-time work, the instinctive drive to earn every drop of sweat money day and night, the relentless struggle that sent Bai Zhenzhen to university — all of Zhang Yu's years of deep accumulation erupted in that moment.

That primal, purest of instincts roared within his heart: "Money!"

"Thirty Spirit Coins per session!"

"She hasn't paid me yet!"

Driven by this instinct, he fiercely resisted the allure of Jade Nectar Maiden Forty-Eight, refusing to let her consume everything within him.

Sensing his resistance, the maiden paid it no heed and slightly expanded her luminous mist, intending to completely suppress his defiance.

But as the mist spread, binding toward Zhang Yu's entire body, Jade Nectar Maiden Forty-Eight suddenly froze in shock.

The moment the mist touched the Azure Silk Flying Sword on Zhang Yu's index finger, lines of information flooded into her mind:

Seven Emotions Sword Dao... Triggered mutual non-interference list... Must immediately cease operation...

In an instant, the previously swirling mist froze.

The light mist began to operate in reverse, expelling all the magic power it had just absorbed.

The observation room erupted in commotion once more.

Yan Qianji exclaimed in surprise, "The magic power is flowing back! It's a two-way exchange — proper Dual Cultivation, not one-sided exploitation!"

Another teacher added in astonishment, "I thought Zhang Yu possessed some special aptitude that attracted the Yin Artifact to directly harvest his essence. But it's actually normal Dual Cultivation? Why would the Yin Artifact voluntarily assist Zhang Yu?"

Inside the laboratory, True Monarch Celestial Seal was equally perplexed. "That initial action... should have been draining Zhang Yu's magic power. Why did it suddenly stop and even reverse the flow? Is this truly normal Dual Cultivation?"

Under the collective gaze, filled with confusion, curiosity, surprise, and astonishment, Zhang Yu — previously half-awake, instinctively resisting all the while — suddenly snapped his eyes open.

ROAR!

With a thunderous roar, Zhang Yu's magic power erupted violently, unleashing the terrifying Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power in all directions.

Just as the surging force field unleashed waves of energy, Zhang Yu snapped to attention. He quickly suppressed his instinctive reaction, restraining the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power that had been rapidly escalating.

Yet even this brief, instinctive surge caught True Monarch Celestial Seal's attention. He scrutinized Zhang Yu's records, comparing them to the recent display of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power. In the research group chat, he remarked, "Zhang Yu's recent eruption of Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power reached a level 15 standard, far surpassing his previous performance."

True Monarch Celestial Seal: "Could this be the result of interacting with the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact?"

One teacher remarked, "But why would this enhance his cultivation of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power? Joyful Union University has no known expertise in this area."

Another teacher suggested, "Could Divine Monarch Jade Nectar be secretly deciphering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power?"

As the faculty and students continued their animated discussions, Yan Qianji suddenly interjected, "Everyone, have you heard the recent news from the Civil Engineering Department?"

The crowd froze, thinking, Who the hell would pay attention to Civil Engineering Department news?

Yan Qianji knew no one would normally follow such updates. If not for Feng Tingting occasionally sharing gossip with him, he wouldn't have known about it either.

Yan Qianji: "Recently, many students from the Civil Engineering Department were trading Jade Nectar Coins, and one student named Ping Han was the most aggressive in his trading."

Yan Qianji: "When the Jade Nectar Coin scheme collapsed, Ping Han happened to be attending the Fellow Cultivators' Assembly at Joyful Union University."

Yan Qianji: "Eventually, he became a Yin Artifact Soul Cultivator to pay off his debts."

Yan Qianji: "Ping Han was an upperclassman in the Civil Engineering Department, and he had cultivated the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering to their peak."

Yan Qianji: "As you know, the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering form the foundation of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power."

A teacher exclaimed in shock: "Are you suggesting... that the Yin Artifact artifact spirit in the laboratory is actually Ping Han? And that he just transferred his cultivation of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering to Zhang Yu through Dual Cultivation?"

Yan Qianji: "......"

Yan Qianji: "That's not what I mean. The timing doesn't add up. By the time Ping Han became a Soul Cultivator, these artifact spirits had already escaped."

Yan Qianji: "What I'm suggesting is that during the Fellow Cultivators' Assembly, Ping Han's cultivation may have been harvested."

Yan Qianji: "And it's possible... that this very Yin Artifact was used in the process."

Yan Qianji: "During the cultivation harvesting, Divine Monarch Jade Nectar likely took the most valuable parts, leaving the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering — considered impurities and residue — in this Yin Artifact."

Yan Qianji: During the recent Dual Cultivation process, it was transferred to Zhang Yu.

Yan Qianji: This led to a significant advancement in Zhang Yu's cultivation of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering, which in turn caused a surge in his cultivation of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power.

As the project team rapidly exchanged information among themselves, Zhang Yu stood awkwardly under everyone's gaze, his mind in chaos.

Damn it... I'll never participate in another experiment like this, he cursed inwardly.

Noticing the flickering gazes of True Monarch Celestial Seal and True Monarch Magnetic Pole as they clearly communicated through the Spirit Realm, Zhang Yu found himself at a loss for words.

True Monarch Celestial Seal: Should I explain, or will you?

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: I'm not familiar with the Civil Engineering Department students. You handle the conversation.

In the next moment, True Monarch Magnetic Pole vanished from the laboratory.

True Monarch Celestial Seal turned to Zhang Yu, his gaze intense. "Student," he asked, "can you sense a significant advancement in your cultivation of the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering? Has the level of your Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power also increased?"

Just as Zhang Yu hesitated, unsure how to respond, a message from Zhang Pianpian materialized before him.

Zhang Pianpian: I'm sending this message using the Supreme Clarity Realm, so no one else can see it.

Zhang Pianpian: But you must not reply. True Monarch Magnetic Pole is monitoring this place and can see it.

Zhang Pianpian: Your next answer should be "seems like."

Zhang Yu nodded and said, "Seems like."

"Don't just say 'seems like'," True Monarch Celestial Seal said sternly, staring at Zhang Yu. "Examine yourself thoroughly first, then come back and tell me."

Zhang Pianpian: Your Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power is now level 15.

Zhang Pianpian: Surprised?

Zhang Yu went through the motions of channeling energy, releasing bursts of Earthly Fiend Gravity that caused his body to hover upside down in the air.

Then, with a look of delight, he exclaimed, "My Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power seems to be level 15!"

True Monarch Celestial Seal smiled and nodded. "This is the benefit to your cultivation from dual cultivating with the latest Yin Artifact developed in our laboratory."

Zhang Yu internally rolled his eyes, but his expression remained joyful. "Such a fortunate opportunity!"

Hearing this exchange, Ying Xin, Gongshu Jin, and Yu Xinghan, standing nearby, all widened their eyes in equal parts shock and envy.

In that fleeting moment, Yu Xinghan glanced at the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact beside him, its crystalline, diamond-like form catching the light. A thought surged through his mind: If I can achieve such remarkable progress in just a short time, what's wrong with using a Yin Artifact?

Sensing the shift in his mindset, Yu Xinghan realized he had reached a new level of spiritual understanding in the Dual Cultivation Dao.

He inwardly sighed: Master was right all along. Spiritual growth truly comes from life's trials and accumulation, not just relentless, forced cultivation.

Beside him, True Monarch Celestial Seal spoke with a smile, "Excellent! This is a great development."

"Normally, in your situation, we would charge a fee."

Zhang Yu cursed inwardly: Damn it... I trained these Martial Arts myself, and you're charging me?

True Monarch Celestial Seal continued, "However, since you're a student at Myriad Laws University, we'll consider this free — this time."

"Of course, the condition is that you must continue participating in our future experiments."

Zhang Yu cursed again: More of this?

He forced a hesitant expression onto his face before shaking his head. "I'm sorry, Teacher. I don't want to participate in this experiment anymore."

True Monarch Celestial Seal looked surprised. "Why not? We're not charging you, and you can still advance your cultivation. Why refuse?"

Zhang Pianpian: "Just do as I taught you..."

A trace of lingering fear showed on Zhang Yu's face as he said, "Teacher, my body went out of control just now. I felt like I was about to die."

"This thing is too dangerous. Let's just give up on it."

Hearing the word "dangerous," True Monarch Celestial Seal realized that his lack of mastery over the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact had caused the uncontrollable incident.

A hint of embarrassment surfaced in True Monarch Celestial Seal's mind, but he maintained a righteous expression as he said, "Are you doubting the school's latest technology? Besides, with both True Monarch Magnetic Pole and me here, even if something unexpected happens, we should be able to handle it, right?"

Zhang Yu said, "But... one or two times is one thing, but asking me to work for free long-term..."

Seeing Zhang Yu's troubled expression, True Monarch Celestial Seal snorted coldly. "You want to charge us instead?"

Zhang Yu said, "Last year, I charged at least 25 Spirit Coins per session, and now it's at least 30."

True Monarch Celestial Seal was surprised. "25 Spirit Coins?"

Zhang Yu said, "True Monarch, if you don't believe me, you can ask Teacher Yin Jiurao from the Pharmacology Department. She was the one who bought it."
