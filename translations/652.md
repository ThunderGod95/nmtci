# Chapter 652: Why We Fight

As the Final Battle commenced, whether it was the Ten Great Universities, the Thirty-Six Upper Colleges, the Seventy-Two Lower Colleges, or countless Vocational Colleges and High Schools... all were either watching the live broadcast, awaiting news updates, or checking for information, using every means to follow the start of this decisive clash.

On the floating continent, overwhelming advertisements had filled every inch of space.

From the vast blue sky to the smallest blade of grass, every bamboo stalk, and every stone on the battlefield was plastered with dense layers of advertisements.

When Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing arrived at the battlefield, the live broadcast's popularity surged to a fever pitch. Countless Spirit Realm messages converged above the arena, forming visible waves of divine power that swept across the entire battlefield.

Kuang Tianqing: "Zhang Yu, let's fight. This world has waited too long for this battle."

Zhang Yu: "It has been too long. Then let's end it quickly."

Their gazes briefly locked. In the next instant... there was no further buildup, no superfluous dialogue, and no probing attacks.

From the moment the battle began, both sides unleashed their full power, determined to crush their opponent with overwhelming speed and force.

Their shared confidence stemmed from the belief that they were superior to their rival.

As Zhang Yu wielded the coiled longsword forged from Bai Zhenzhen's corpse, he felt an uncanny unity with the weapon.

The Feather Spirit Root within the sword resonated with the True Spirit Root in Zhang Yu's body. With each pulse, they exchanged spiritual energy and Magic Power, constantly stimulating, adapting, and... amplifying each other.

Simultaneously, Bai Zhenzhen's phantom appeared behind him, gently embracing him and whispering, "Yu Zi, let's defeat him together."

Pure white Extreme Emotion Sword Qi surged through his body, flowing from the sword into Zhang Yu's flesh, bringing with it a terrifying pressure.

Yet, drawing upon his dual Spiritual Roots, his body forged through countless trials, and the blessings of the Civil Engineering Holy Body, Zhang Yu withstood the backlash of the Extreme Emotion Sword Qi. He maintained a precarious balance between self-healing and self-destruction.

This meant that Zhang Yu, wielding his sword, could harness the power of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao for longer than Bai Zhenzhen, driving its destructive force to even greater extremes in battle.

"Kuang Tianqing!"

With a thunderous roar, a blinding light erupted from Zhang Yu's body as his Golden Core shattered. He unleashed a heaven-shaking sword qi, lunging fiercely at Kuang Tianqing.

*Wah!*

Amidst a piercing scream and the radiant glow of the shattering Golden Core, Kuang Tianqing spat out a pulsating mass of flesh and blood.

Simultaneously, the artifact spirits within Kuang Tianqing's body activated autonomously, pushing her Bionic to 120% capacity. Her entire being seemed to dissolve into a phantom, as if she had transcended the boundaries of this world.

"Four Schools' Academic Overachievers, emerge!"

The combined power of the academic overachievers from the four Heavenly Demon Schools surged from Kuang Tianqing's body. Fueled by the Shattered Core's energy, it was channeled into the Demonic Fetus.

The Demonic Fetus continuously disintegrated and regenerated, its life and death energies intertwining in an endless cycle. After nine cycles of this chaotic dance, nine consecutive explosions erupted, each hurtling toward Zhang Yu.

"Zhang Yu! You will be defeated!"

The moment the battle began, both sides unleashed their ultimate techniques.

Unrivaled speed within their realm. Unrivaled power within their realm.

Equally earth-shattering techniques clashed, equally devastating forces were unleashed, yet neither could deliver a decisive blow.

For at that moment, both combatants were equally formidable, equally terrifying, equally flawless, equally invincible within the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Thus, they could only continue to push their power, to wring every last drop of strength from their bodies, to force out every ounce of hidden potential.

Perishing Core Technique activated! Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body! Heavenly Demon Void! Netherworld Disintegration! Profound Abyss Void-Returning Art! Ten Thousand Bones Wither Marrow Curse! Great Harmony of Yin and Yang Celestial Melody! Cursed Heaven Myriad Demon Throne! Eight Gods' Peerless Techniques! Four Schools' Academic Overachievers!

Yu Zhen's dual Spiritual Roots! Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power! Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon! Heavenly Sun Radiance God! Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation! Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor! Monster Saint's Myriad Transformations Divine Scripture! Seven Absolutes Bionic! Perishing Core Technique! Immortal Dao Sun! Extreme Emotion Sword Dao!

In the blink of an eye, over a hundred exchanges had passed. The battlefield was now a wasteland of shattered mountains and cracked earth, the ground within dozens of miles resembling a landscape ravaged by relentless natural disasters. Yet this devastation was merely the collateral damage of their clash.

What about Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing, the primary targets of the attacks?

Still undefeated!

Still invincible!

Despite unleashing their strongest techniques in rapid succession, despite enduring scorching heatwaves that burned through their bodies, despite withstanding earth-shattering sword qi that tore at their flesh... it was all futile.

Standing at the pinnacle of their respective realms, having compensated for all their weaknesses, the two combatants remained unable to defeat each other, unable to completely suppress this opponent who blocked their ambitions and obstructed their path to the Immortal Dao.

Wen Wuya, witnessing this spectacle, was utterly stunned. "Strength, speed, defense, destructive power, physique, techniques, potential... every aspect is unprecedented, each pushed to an extravagant extreme. Is this truly the level achievable in the Foundation Establishment Realm?"

Nine Heavens Liu's eyes flickered with streams of data. "How many Spirit Coins would it cost to reach their level in the Foundation Establishment Realm?"

The answer proved incalculable. Both Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing possessed mysteries beyond Nine Heavens Liu's comprehension, representing an absolute information gap that even the top finance student from the ten universities couldn't bridge.

Ye Xingli had no mind to check the chat or see the fans' reactions. Her eyes were fixed on the live stream, her heart churning like a stormy sea. "Throughout history, it's unlikely we'll ever find a university student as formidable as this again."

Facing an opponent as invincible and unbeatable as herself, how could she possibly win?

"Zhang Yu..."

Kuang Tianqing let out a wild laugh, her body dissolving into a phantom as she passed through Zhang Yu's form. "You truly surprise me," she roared.

"Who could have imagined that the insignificant wretch I once publicly humiliated without resistance would now stand before me, evenly matched!"

Bai Zhenzhen whispered, "It's a psychological attack, Yu Zi. Be careful. She's trying to disrupt your mental state and undermine your performance."

Bai Zhenzhen understood perfectly that any shift in mental state — any fluctuation in fighting spirit or resolve — could subtly alter one's power output.

At the level of combat Zhang Yu and Kuang Tianqing had reached, even the slightest change in their power would manifest as a massive disparity in the material world, influencing the battle and determining victory or defeat.

"I understand, but we're not afraid of her psychological tactics."

Zhang Yu's coiled longsword slashed out again, its pure white sword qi tearing through the heavens and earth, splitting Kuang Tianqing's figure in two before it swiftly rejoined.

"Kuang Tianqing," Zhang Yu sneered, "have you forgotten? You were the one who fled from me, twice in a row. Finally decided to stand your ground this time?"

Kuang Tianqing replied calmly, "Escaping was to preserve my Immortal Dao Potential, to secure victory."

"My anger at your slander was also to minimize the loss of Immortal Dao Potential, and likewise, to secure victory."

"But now, at this Final Battle, none of that matters anymore. No matter what you say... you won't shake my resolve even slightly."

Boom! The two clashed violently, like a comet striking the earth. The searing shockwave caused the ground to crater and sink, leaving a meteorite-like crater on the battlefield.

Simultaneously, Kuang Tianqing continued, "Today's battle is for the survival of all living beings, for extending their lifespans. It's for giving everyone a few more years to live, to learn, to work."

"You can feel it, can't you, Zhang Yu? The momentum is on my side today. Everyone wants you to lose!"

Zhang Yu had to admit the truth in her words.

Ever since he defeated Tian Shengong last week to reach the finals against Kuang Tianqing, Zhang Yu had been bombarded daily with messages, private messages, and comments related to the Final Battle.

The overwhelming majority of them expressed the same sentiment: they wanted him to lose.

"Kuang Tianqing wants to extend everyone's lifespan. If she wins, we'll all live a few more years. Just give up already."

"What's wrong with wanting to live longer?"

"Surrender now and stop blocking our path to survival!"

Zhang Yu could sense that Kuang Tianqing now carried the hopes of all living beings, the expectations of countless schools, and the aspirations of countless teachers and students.

After all, who wouldn't want to live a few more years?

He, Zhang Yu, was the one no one wanted to win this battle.

At that moment, Kuang Tianqing's eyes flashed as she unleashed a series of Shattered Core explosions, forcing Zhang Yu back step by step. "Feel it, Zhang Yu? The entire world's expectations rest on me."

"Are you truly prepared?"

"Can you withstand the pressure of winning the championship?"

"Do you even know why you're fighting?"

Amidst the radiant glow of the Golden Core, Kuang Tianqing's arm continuously disintegrated, unleashing a relentless barrage against Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu slashed out with his sword, parrying the attack.

"Why I'm fighting..."

Zhang Yu certainly knew why he was fighting.

In high school, it had been to get into the Ten Great Universities. After entering university... it was, of course, to join a sect.

And joining a sect meant survival.

Survival — that was the primal motivation that had driven him to embark on the path of the Immortal Dao, pass countless exams, earn numerous certifications, and defeat countless opponents.

He simply wanted to survive.

Wasn't that reason enough?

Originally, Zhang Yu had believed it was.

"But why... why do I now feel that this reason is insufficient, utterly insufficient..."

"Is it because I don't know which Immortal Sect Technique to choose after winning the championship?"

"Is it because I don't know where this world should be headed?"

Amidst the soaring crimson light, Kuang Tianqing unleashed the Netherworld Disintegration, fueled by the Shattered Core technique and driven by a desperate determination, unwavering will, and resolute dao heart. Her relentless assault forced Zhang Yu into constant retreat, pressing him further and further back.

Yet in Zhang Yu's eyes, Kuang Tianqing's figure seemed to shift and transform, morphing into a series of familiar and unfamiliar faces:

Wang Yin: "If you want to rise above others like me, you must learn to devour them."

Nine Heavens Liu: "Are you content to toil on construction sites your entire life, or to slave away in the Artifact Refinement Department's laboratory? Or will you use your mind, become clever, and make money work for you, earning more Spirit Coins than you could ever dream of in the Artifact Refinement or Civil Engineering Departments?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: "People naturally strive for higher positions, just as water flows downhill. While the Civil Engineering Department has treated you well, our Artifact Refinement Department offers far greater horizons..."

Director Gao: "Zhang Yu, the Finance Department is moving in. Your Master is powerless to protect you..."

Dao Qiankun: "I want to change this world."

"The desire to change the world isn't limited to Immortals or Soul Transformation cultivators. Even Foundation Establishment, Qi Refining, or ordinary mortals can harbor such ambitions."

"In this world, weakness is scorned. Yet every person begins their journey as a weakling..."

Amidst thunderous explosions, Kuang Tianqing's entire body surged with blood like molten lava, her surging Magic Power erupting like a volcanic eruption, driving the force shattering her Golden Core and repeatedly driving Zhang Yu back! Back! And back again!

"Zhang Yu!" Kuang Tianqing roared. "Destiny favors me!"

"The entire world is counting on my victory! What can you possibly use to fight me?!"

The two combatants retreated as they fought, instantly covering thousands of meters, from the plains to a lake, which they instantly blasted into a massive crater, unleashing a torrential downpour.

In Zhang Yu's eyes, an increasingly intense emotion began to surface.

"I... don't just want to survive."
