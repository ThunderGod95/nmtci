# Chapter 677: Lunar War 2

Immediately after breaking through to the Soul Transformation stage, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole had rushed to the Moon, determined to reclaim it.

After all, the entire Moon — or rather, the magical artifact known as the Long Night Jade Palace — held immense significance. Refined by Myriad Laws University, it served as a super-artifact for communication across all layers of the Spirit Realm, making it invaluable in terms of worth, function, and strategic importance.

During her first attempt to reclaim the Moon, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole sensed the presence of another Soul Transformation cultivator and realized she couldn't defeat them in the short term. To protect the Sun Magical Artifact — Sun-Patrolling Golden Crow on the other side, she had no choice but to abandon the Moon.

It was during this encounter that she recognized a familiar aura emanating from the Soul Transformation cultivator on the Moon.

"The Finance Department..."

Now, gazing at Divine Monarch Chain Nexus standing proudly in the moonlight, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole said coldly, "You abandoned your family and wealth to serve an Evil God, only to become a mere gatekeeper here."

"Chain Nexus, is this what you truly sought? To remain here, clinging to a dying struggle?"

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus replied calmly, "Guarding this position on the Second Layer of the Moon was my own decision."

"Because I understand the crucial importance of this position. As long as the Moon remains in my grasp, the Second Layer will forever be trapped in economic crisis, unable to consolidate its resources and participate in the coming great war. Moreover, by remaining here, I can draw upon the Common People Qi Luck of the living beings from the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Layers, sustained by the resources of multiple layers. How could you possibly stand against me?"

At that moment, a figure composed of swirling, multicolored light materialized behind Divine Monarch Chain Nexus — the Evil God Auspicious God himself.

"Forced to break through your defenses and engage in battle before reaching your peak," Auspicious God declared, "this proves that the situation remains firmly under our control."

"You are the ones clinging to a dying struggle."

Divine Monarch Greenwood stepped forward, Earthly Fiend Gravity surging around him in layers of distorted light. "Enough talk. Let's fight, Magnetic Pole."

As he spoke, golden radiance erupted behind Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole — the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda descending directly to suppress all directions. Countless Soul Cultivators, empowered by the pagoda's blessing, swarmed forth from the Spirit Realm.

Observing the mobilization of these myriad Soul Cultivators, Auspicious God chuckled softly and summoned a treasure throne from the Dark Spirit Realm. Beneath the throne, countless Soul Cultivators knelt in devout supplication, ceaselessly offering prayers to him.

"Going all out right from the start?" the Auspicious God sneered. "Then let's fight to the death."

The two great powers clashed with absolute ferocity, their every strike obliterating countless consciousnesses in the Spirit Realm and Dark Spirit Realm.

As Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and the Auspicious God battled in the Spirit Realm, the communication environment on the Moon fluctuated violently, as if a storm were ravaging the entire celestial body.

To countless observers, the Moon in the sky shifted between blood-red and pristine white, its appearance constantly transforming.

Within the Spirit Realm and Dark Spirit Realm, countless storms raged. Viruses spread with each shift in the moonlight, and countless souls were overwhelmed by the deluge of spiritual information, their Bionics spiraling out of control, as if possessed by demons.

Boom!

Simultaneously, Divine Monarch Greenwood and Divine Monarch Chain Nexus collided with earth-shattering force.

A massive explosion erupted across the Long Night Jade Palace, a structure spanning over a thousand kilometers in diameter.

"Chain Nexus..." Divine Monarch Greenwood roared, "Even if you win, what then? The Heavenly Court will descend and settle all accounts. No matter how much you profit in these two years, you'll all die, lose everything, and be condemned to eternal damnation!"

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus sneered. "The will of the strong represents the future of the world. We merely follow the Immortal's guidance, striving for greater profits. Who in Kunxu, from top to bottom, doesn't do the same?"

As they spoke, the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power erupted, sending black hole-like blasts hurtling toward Chain Nexus.

Chain Nexus countered with the Primordial Qi Invisible Great Handprint, repeatedly striking down to block every attack from Divine Monarch Greenwood.

One wielded martial arts, the other daoist arts, but both had fused their techniques into every movement — fists, palms, legs, claws... Even the most basic exchanges carried terrifying power capable of destroying cities and nations, yet neither could gain the upper hand.

At that moment, Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole formed a Dao Seal, and a fiery dragon soared skyward. The thousand-zhang-tall Heavenly Sun Radiance God joined the fray, flanking Divine Monarch Greenwood to encircle Chain Nexus.

Watching this, Chain Nexus chuckled softly. "Finance is about selling the world to gain power. But what difference is there between you and me?"

"Magnetic Pole, Greenwood, if not for scourging the world and enslaving all living beings, how would you have attained your Immortal Dao cultivation? How would you possess the strength to challenge me now?"

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole spoke coldly, "The tides of progress sweep away obsolete sects, propelling Kunxu to its current state. This order has proven itself the most efficient, capable of cultivating the greatest martial power."

"You're turning back the clock, disrupting the world for your own selfish ends. How dare you compare yourselves to us?"

The flames surged at Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's command, engulfing the Moon as if to incinerate it, illuminating the Second Layer's sky.

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus replied slowly, "The world? The world... when has it ever truly mattered to us?"

"Magnetic Pole, Greenwood, whether you admit it or not, we are all tyrants, devouring the masses and exploiting the world for our own selfish desires, our own ambitions."

He roared, "The Righteous-Demonic War... it ended long ago!"

"Our current battle has nothing to do with morality or righteousness. It's purely a struggle for control over billions of lives, because we all see them as our resources."

"This battle will decide which of us devours everything!"

With Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's thunderous roar, the opposing forces clashed violently, sending tremors through the entire Moon.

By this point, all three Soul Transformation cultivators understood that words had been exhausted and principles had been debated to their limits.

After this intense struggle — a series of mutual probes, provocations, and ideological clashes — neither side had gained a decisive advantage, whether in martial arts, daoist arts, Bionic combat, or Spirit Realm collisions.

To secure victory and defeat their opponents, they needed to unleash even greater power, to unleash their ultimate techniques.

Thus, Divine Monarch Greenwood revealed his first trump card.

He clenched his right fist, and the surrounding light immediately distorted. The terrifying Earthly Fiend Gravity surged wildly, distorting the atmosphere, bending light, and warping space itself!

Ever since witnessing Dao Qiankun's demonstration of Immortal Sect Martial Arts and his mastery of Spatial Technology, Divine Monarch Greenwood had gained profound insights.

These insights deepened further when his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power broke through to the Soul Transformation realm, granting him an even deeper understanding of this martial art.

After Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole imparted her knowledge of spatial technology to him, Divine Monarch Greenwood further refined his understanding of how to influence space using the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

The entire Moon tilted violently as Divine Monarch Greenwood tore at it. Sensing the violent shifts in the surrounding spatial structure, Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's expression darkened before he chuckled, "Greenwood, I never imagined someone of your caliber would not only break through to Soul Transformation but also advance military-grade martial arts to such a level."

"Though you can't shatter the structure, you can subtly distort it. No wonder you two managed to squeeze in so quickly."

"Excellent. Without worthy opponents like you today, how would I prove my divine power? How would I display my divine might?"

"The stronger you are, the more meaningful my victory over you will be today."

As he spoke, countless users in the Dark Spirit Realm were already watching the live broadcast of the battle.

Intense Qi Luck began to converge upon Divine Monarch Chain Nexus.

From Myriad Laws University, Heavenly Demon University, pharmaceutical factories, classrooms, cemeteries, vocational colleges, wilderness areas...

It was an endless stream, flowing from every corner of Kunxu Second Layer, fueled by the hopes and desires of countless people.

"Defeat Myriad Laws University!"

"You must win, Righteous Qi Alliance!"

"Kill these old relics of the past! The future belongs to the new era of Myriad Laws, open-source everything!"

"As long as the Righteous Qi Alliance governs the world, we'll be free to learn any cultivation art or knowledge we desire!"

"We'll never again be bound by exams, certifications, rankings, or grades!"

Empowered by the surging Common People Qi Luck, Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's aura intensified dramatically. He smiled faintly. "Do you feel it, you two?"

"You claim to uphold the world's order?"

"But it seems the majority of the world's people stand with me."

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, observing the scene, showed no surprise. She merely recalled the recent battle, thinking, "I wonder when he started broadcasting this? Still, I didn't say anything I shouldn't have."

For seasoned veterans like Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood, who had witnessed the rise of news, media, and live streaming, treating every major event — whether cameras were present or not — as a live broadcast had become second nature.

Divine Monarch Greenwood remarked calmly, "Chain Nexus, we've barely warmed up. Why are you already delivering your victory speech?"

In the next instant, the two sides clashed again. The flames on the Moon burned ever brighter, their searing radiance radiating across the Earth like a second sun.

And so began the first day of the Lunar War.

---

While Zhang Yu devoted a fraction of his consciousness to observe the battle, the rest of his mind remained fully immersed in cultivation.

The Lunar War had placed immense pressure on him, driving him to seize every possible moment for cultivation.

In the graveyard, vast quantities of spiritual energy surged toward him.

Through constant absorption and refinement, this energy was drawn into his Dantian's Golden Core, transforming into surging streams of Magic Power that coursed through his entire body.

Over the past two months of cultivation, Zhang Yu's cultivation had advanced significantly. His thirteenth layer of Dao Foundation had reached perfection, and his physical body radiated an aura of flawless, indomitable strength. Every strand of flesh and every inch of bone had been tempered like a thousand-hammered steel, surpassing the durability of countless Golden Core Realm magical artifacts.

Even Zhang Yu himself could no longer harm his own body.

His defensive capabilities had reached an unprecedented peak.

Simultaneously, his Magic Power continued to surge, reaching 5,866 units.

After another night of relentless cultivation, a dramatic shift occurred on the Lunar battlefield.

---

The Moon remained locked in place by the warring factions.

As the Sun rose, the Sun Magical Artifact — Sun-Patrolling Golden Crow, radiating boundless light and heat, tore through the atmosphere and hurtled toward the lunar battlefield.

In that moment, the Sun and Moon shone together, their blinding radiance illuminating the entire Second Layer.

Divine Monarch Chain Nexus, witnessing this spectacle, shifted his expression. "Magnetic Pole, do you realize how many Spirit Coins those two magical artifacts are worth?"

"I don't care about Spirit Coins! If they can't be used for my purposes, I'll blow them all up!" Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole roared.

The flames engulfing the Heavenly Sun Radiance God surged through a series of transformations: from crimson to violet, violet to azure, azure to yellow, and finally yellow to white, unleashing a terrifying heat that threatened to melt the entire Moon.

"This is..." Divine Monarch Chain Nexus's heart sank as he observed the scene. "An Immortal Sect Technique."

"Correct!" Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole bellowed. "The Great Sun Glazed Pure Fire!"

"Immeasurable and Unspeakable Transformation!"

Blazing flames erupted from the Moon and Sun, growing increasingly blinding as the celestial bodies drew closer.

Within the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's body, the Soul Transformation bodies extracted from the Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations' 666th layer were ignited.

Fueled by this violent combustion, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, driven by Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's Immortal Sect Technique, began to amplify its power infinitely and without restraint.

Mid-stage Primordial Spirit... Peak-stage Primordial Spirit... The Heavenly Sun Radiance God's power surged relentlessly, shattering all limits!

"Chain Nexus, let us continue this battle."

"We will undoubtedly triumph in this conflict. If necessary, I will burn the Moon and Sun to ashes today and bury you with a million Spirit Coins!"

Countless observers were shaken to their core, feeling Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's will, like boundless light, radiating across the Kunxu's second, third, fourth, and fifth layers.

This marked the second day of the Lunar War.
