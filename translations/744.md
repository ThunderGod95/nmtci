# Chapter 744: Sect Examination Fever

Seeing Zhang Yu's silence, Yun Zhiguang shook her head, sensing he was still clinging to a sliver of hope.

So she decided to be more direct: "To be honest, the Heavenly Court single-handedly pushed for this Sect Staff Selection Examination to be extended to the lower layers. Their sole purpose is to plant their own people within the sects."

"Naturally, the sects themselves opposed this."

"In the end, the Heavenly Court and the upper echelons of the Ten Great Sects reached an agreement: if the lower-layer cultivators perform poorly in this Sect Staff Selection Examination, it will never be held at the lower layers again."

Zhang Yu's heart stirred at her words. "So... even though Immortals originate from the sects and established the Heavenly Court, the interests of the sects and the Heavenly Court are not entirely aligned. There are still conflicts and contradictions between them."

Yun Zhiguang continued, "Therefore, in this Sect Examination, no one from the Fifth Layer or below will pass."

"As for the Seventh to Tenth Layers, the successful candidates have already been chosen. Even my Myriad Laws Sect will only have five people pass."

"The only reason these five are allowed to pass is to prove that the Sect Staff Examination is passable, that its difficulty is reasonable, and that anyone who fails simply lacks the necessary ability. This prevents the Heavenly Court from finding fault."

Zhang Yu asked, "Since people from the Seventh to Tenth Layers can pass, then what about those below the Fifth Layer...?"

Yun Zhiguang raised a single finger and wagged it. "Who do you think those five cultivators from the Seventh to Tenth Layers are? I can tell you, every single one of them is a reincarnated soul from within the sect."

"Each of them spent twenty, even thirty years in their previous lives taking the Sect Examination."

"And don't think they're weak just because they failed to enter the sect after twenty or thirty years."

"In their past lives, they had already pushed their personal cultivation, Sect Staff Aptitude Test scores, moral standards, professional skills, and everything else to the absolute limit."

"They failed to get in not because they were weak, but because the competition for the Sect Examination is simply too fierce."

"The average time successful candidates from the upper layers spend taking the Sect Examination is about twenty-eight years."

"You should understand what this means. Cultivators born in the upper layers, whether in terms of their talent for the Immortal Dao or their cultivation conditions, are vastly superior to you. But even so... they must still endure twenty to thirty years of tempering before they even have a chance to successfully enter the sect."

"Now, those five reincarnated cultivators taking the examination in the lower layers... perhaps they couldn't compete with their rivals in the upper layers, but down here, with the experience from their past lives and the preparations from this one... they'll sweep the Examination Field."

"In contrast, you've only had a mere three months to prepare. When the time comes, you probably won't even meet the passing score for the Sect Staff Examination."

"Reincarnating to the lower layers just to take the exam? This isn't just 'Sect Examination immigration' — it's straight-up 'Reincarnation Sect Examination'!" Zhang Yu thought, his mind reeling with a thousand protests, yet he forced himself to remain calm and think rationally.

He mused inwardly, "Did these reincarnated guys get advance notice and find this alternative path, reincarnating to the lower layers to take the exam?"

"No... That might just be a secondary objective. The main reason, I'm afraid, is that someone within the sect has been plotting for a long time to counter the Heavenly Court's promotion of the Sect Examination."

"Doesn't that mean the Heavenly Court's plan to expand the Sect Examination downward was laid out long ago?"

"And this Great Reconstruction... even the University War... were they also planned far in advance?"

The thought sent a jolt through Zhang Yu's heart.

Yun Zhiguang, seeing Zhang Yu's silence, assumed he had finally grasped the difficulty of the situation. She nodded and said, "Alright, now that you understand, rest up. I still have many tasks for you..."

Just then, Zhang Yu looked at Yun Zhiguang with determination and said, "Senior Sister Yun, no matter what, I still want to try."

"Tsk..." Yun Zhiguang looked at Zhang Yu with impatience, her opinion of him dropping several notches in an instant.

"I really wasted my breath on you."

"Fine. If you want to bash your head against a wall, go ahead."

Yun Zhiguang's projection vanished, clearly unwilling to waste another word on Zhang Yu.

In her view, Zhang Yu would ultimately fail the examination even if he gave it his all, and would then obediently follow her arrangements.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu watched Yun Zhiguang's disappearing projection and continued to ponder the matter of choosing a position.

He compiled all the sect information he had gathered from Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole, Divine Monarch Greenwood, and True Monarch Starfire. After summarizing it all, he listed several potential options for himself.

"Either I become a researcher at the Heaven and Earth Pavilion, or I join the Heaven's Mandate Hall that True Monarch Starfire mentioned to participate in the Righteous-Demonic Conflict and produce various Immortal Dao elements."

"And A-Zhen..."

Bai Zhenzhen's image surfaced in Zhang Yu's mind. "Most of the intelligence I have now is related to the Myriad Laws Sect. If A-Zhen wants to apply for a position in the Heavenly Sword Sect, we'll need to find a way to get more information on them."

However, among the cultivators Zhang Yu knew, they were either cultivators who had never even entered the Heavenly Sword Sect or those who had only trained there many years ago.

He was severely lacking in the latest information and data on the Heavenly Sword Sect's current situation.

Not long after Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen began pondering and gathering information, Zhang Pianpian sent Zhang Yu another message: "Meet at the old place."

Within the Great Purity Realm, Zhang Yu looked at Zhang Pianpian's figure and said, "Sis."

Zhang Pianpian replied, "I'm leaving soon."

Zhang Yu was startled. "Leaving?"

"I'll be heading to the regions above the 11th Layer," Zhang Pianpian explained. "The specific location is still uncertain."

Looking at Zhang Yu, she continued, "Have you decided which position in the Myriad Laws Sect you're applying for?"

After Zhang Yu voiced his thoughts and hesitation, Zhang Pianpian said, "The Heaven and Earth Pavilion and the Heaven's Mandate Hall each have their pros and cons. It's normal for you to feel conflicted."

"As it happens, I've also gathered some information. I think there's a place that might be a good fit for you."

Zhang Yu's ears perked up immediately. He listened as Zhang Pianpian explained, "Within the Myriad Laws Sect, every new Immortal Dao Technology developed each year needs to have its copyright established."

"This process naturally requires someone to conduct approvals, judging each of these Immortal Dao Technologies on aspects like practicality, novelty, and creativity."

"And the place that oversees this work is called the Edict Pavilion."

"The Edict Pavilion?" Zhang Yu's eyes lit up instantly. "Doesn't that mean the people who approve Immortal Dao Technologies there get direct access to all the most cutting-edge techniques?"

Zhang Pianpian replied, "Not necessarily. You have to understand that whether in the sect, the university, or private companies, the pressure to develop Immortal Dao Technologies is immense. A massive number of new techniques are developed every year, and older versions are constantly updated."

"The levels of these newly created and updated techniques vary greatly. Let's just take cultivation arts as an example."

"The vast majority of newly created and updated techniques are inevitably basic-grade, intermediate-grade, and expert-grade. Military-grade cultivation techniques are extremely rare, and the proportion of Immortal Sect-level techniques is even smaller."

"Most of the review work within the Edict Pavilion is definitely focused on the basic, intermediate, and expert grades. The personnel responsible for approving military-grade, let alone Immortal Sect-level techniques, are certainly not positions just anyone can hold."

Zhang Yu nodded slightly, instantly understanding. Even if he got into the Edict Pavilion, he would still have to climb the ranks continuously to access the most cutting-edge Immortal Dao knowledge.

He then asked another question that concerned him: "What about the Edict Pavilion's reviewers? For example, during the process of approving a cultivation art, what happens if they learn the technique?"

Zhang Pianpian replied, "That's the greatest benefit of the Edict Pavilion. For every Immortal Dao Technology they approve, they gain the right to use it, though they cannot commercialize it or teach it to others."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's eyes couldn't help but light up.

Zhang Pianpian smiled faintly. She had chosen the Edict Pavilion as a target precisely because she sensed her younger brother learned everything exceptionally quickly.

She continued, "But because of this, the Edict Pavilion has extremely high recruitment standards for the Sect Staff Selection Examination, and the exam is incredibly difficult. It's always a highly sought-after position, and the competition in every Sect Examination is fierce."

Zhang Yu nodded. The exam's difficulty was a given, but as for the fierce competition... this Sect Examination was only for cultivators from the 1st to 10th Layers. The intensity of the competition surely couldn't compare to the higher levels.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "This time... perhaps this is actually my greatest opportunity to secure such a popular position."

Zhang Pianpian continued, "And because the annual technology review workload is both heavy and voluminous, the Edict Pavilion's internal staff is large and complex, and the competition is exceptionally fierce."

"But any cultivator who manages to climb to the upper echelons of the Edict Pavilion is, without exception, a formidable expert — erudite, with a profound foundation, and proficient in various Immortal Dao Technologies."

"Afterward, whether they choose to pursue research and development or advance in management, their potential for growth is extremely high."

Zhang Yu understood immediately. The Edict Pavilion was clearly a gathering place for the Myriad Laws Sect's most competitive cultivators. The intense competition meant promotion was difficult, but those who emerged victorious were undeniably powerful and had boundless prospects.

Zhang Pianpian then added a reminder, "Therefore, the Edict Pavilion is filled with sect disciples from powerful backgrounds. These are individuals with extreme confidence in their talent and financial resources, all aiming to soar to the top. The intensity of competition there far surpasses that of other peaks."

Watching the change in Zhang Yu's expression, Zhang Pianpian said, "It seems you've already made up your mind."

Zhang Yu nodded. "The Edict Pavilion is indeed a good fit for me. I want to give it a try."

After finishing their discussion about the Edict Pavilion, Zhang Yu asked about the Heavenly Sword Sect.

Zhang Pianpian understood that Zhang Yu was inquiring on behalf of Bai Zhenzhen.

"Before I leave, I'll do my best to gather relevant information and send it to you all at once."

Next, Zhang Yu asked about the differing attitudes of the Heavenly Court and the sects toward the Sect Staff Selection Examination.

Zhang Pianpian explained, "The sects have always resisted the Heavenly Court's interference."

"That's why the Heavenly Court has been cultivating new factions within the sects. By arranging this Sect Examination, they aim to establish a long-term precedent — a publicly accessible and continuous channel for cultivators from Levels 1-10 to join the sects. This would reduce information asymmetry, which the Ten Great Sects naturally oppose."

"However, the conflict between the two sides will be kept within a certain intensity. Although the examination content is arranged by the sects, the process is supervised by the Heavenly Court. As long as you can pass the Sect Examination with genuine skill, the sects won't forcibly stop you."

Zhang Pianpian then dropped another piece of news. "Before long, the Heavenly Court should provide you with some support."

Several days passed in the blink of an eye.

Within the Spirit Realm, under the 10x Spirit Realm Acceleration, True Monarch Starfire was instructing the three on the Sect Examination. "From what I know," he began, "the Sect Examination is divided into a preliminary examination, a re-examination, and an interview."

"The preliminary examination is a unified test that assesses a candidate's personal cultivation, moral standards, and comprehensive aptitude for sect affairs. The total score is 200 points, and you must achieve a passing score of 150 or higher to advance to the re-examination."

"Moral standards are judged according to sect regulations. Aptitude for sect affairs considers your comprehension, judgment, and organizational skills when facing various situations..."

"All of this is tested within an Illusionary Realm, examining each person's most authentic and direct reactions."

"Back when I was still in the sect, I heard that a single preliminary examination typically takes about three hours. During that time, a Nascent Soul Cultivator must endure over 1,000 Illusionary Realms and answer more than 10,000 questions. That means making a judgment on a complex problem almost every 0.25 seconds. The entire process is designed to test a candidate's innermost reactions under extreme pressure, pushing them far beyond their limits."

"Although the difficulty for the Golden Core group is one tier lower, it's still extremely challenging for Cultivators at the Golden Core Realm."

"Therefore, to score high in this process, you must be familiar with the various situations within the sect. More importantly, you need to engrain all sorts of habits, reactions, and knowledge into your very bones."

"But much of what is considered common sense within the sect is completely unknown to you. You have no understanding of it. That's why knowledge of the Myriad Laws Sect's customs, legal statutes, cultural history, Dharma Realm common sense, and so on is crucial. The more you master, the higher your 'Sect Literacy' will be. This content is vast and all-encompassing... With only three months left, you must study diligently."

Just as Zhang Yu was studying diligently, a moan echoed from within his mind.

"So satisfying!"

He heard Lady Fortune let out a great shout, laughing heartily. "I've finally recovered to the rank of a 3rd-tier Evil God!"

Zhang Yu's gaze shifted, and he thought, "You're finally awake. Hurry up and enhance my potential."

Lady Fortune giggled, and Zhang Yu felt a surge of sinister power rush into his Sea of Consciousness. A sharp sting followed in his palm as a transparent symbol materialized there.

Seeing the transparent symbol, a wave of anticipation washed over Zhang Yu.

Just like the initial activation of the Feather Book and its two subsequent upgrades, he would have to wait for this symbol to be completely filled with black.

"It shouldn't take more than a few days to complete."

Meanwhile, Lady Fortune began asking about what had happened while she was asleep and the current situation.

"Triple salary! You spent over ten billion Spirit Coins?!"

"You're in debt for over ten billion?! Aaaahhh!"

"The Heavenly Court has descended?!"

"The Sect Staff Examination?!"

Listening to Zhang Yu's explanation, Lady Fortune felt as if she were being repeatedly tossed into the sky only to plummet back to earth. Pain, surprise, anger, shock — a torrent of emotions erupted within her in an instant, leaving her utterly speechless.

But when she finally heard about the Sect Staff Examination, even the news of the ten-billion-Spirit-Coin debt was immediately overshadowed.

"If he passes the Sect Examination and successfully joins a sect, the wish path set by the Evil God Ritual will be more than halfway complete."

As Lady Fortune considered this, she couldn't decide whether this was a good thing or a bad thing.

Two days later, when the rune on Zhang Yu's palm was nearly half-filled, the official announcement for the Sect Staff Selection Examination was released. The job positions and application requirements for each of the Ten Great Sects were published simultaneously.

Righteous Gods even began selling review materials for the Sect Examination, and sales skyrocketed in an instant.

For a time, the Ten Great Universities and the world beyond were in an uproar. It seemed everyone was discussing the Sect Examination. Many wealthy individuals even quit their jobs, planning to dedicate the next three months entirely to preparing for the exam.

At the same time, Deng Bingding contacted Zhang Yu through the Spirit Realm, her projection appearing before True Monarch Starfire and the others.

After greeting everyone, Deng Bingding explained the purpose of her visit.

"True Monarch Starfire, the Heavenly Court hopes that in addition to Zhang Yu and his two companions, you can arrange for other students to join the tutoring sessions. They are all elites selected from the Ten Great Universities."

Before True Monarch Starfire could refuse, Deng Bingding continued, "I know this will require extra effort from you, so the Heavenly Court is willing to provide support."

The assistance offered by the Heavenly Court was simple yet crucial: free access to an Illusionary Realm that simulated a sect environment, mock Sect Examinations, and a 20x Spirit Realm Acceleration function, also free of charge.

Hearing this, True Monarch Starfire was immediately tempted.

After all, Kunxu was developing at an astonishing pace. Immortal Dao Technology, moral standards, and cultural trends were constantly changing.

True Monarch Starfire wasn't sure what changes had occurred within the sect during his absence. Even with the review materials purchased from Righteous Gods, he couldn't feel completely at ease.

The 20x Spirit Realm Acceleration was even more compelling. Standard Spirit Realm Acceleration maxed out at 10x; a 20x boost would double their efficiency.

True Monarch Starfire immediately asked, "Is it generated using the latest data?"

Deng Bingding smiled faintly. "Rest assured, True Monarch. Everything is the most up-to-date version."

She then added, "Regarding the copyright and sale of the course recordings..."

True Monarch Starfire's eyes glinted, and he said solemnly, "Everything is negotiable."

After a brief negotiation, True Monarch Starfire and Deng Bingding quickly reached an agreement.

Soon after, a new Spirit Realm classroom was provided to True Monarch Starfire, Zhang Yu, and the other three. The classroom was equipped with all the new functions Deng Bingding had promised.

Deng Bingding also reminded them, "If you want to invite anyone else to this tutoring class, just let me know."

"We're willing to support more participants to increase the chances of admission."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu's heart stirred. The figures of several people flashed through his mind. He turned to True Monarch Starfire and said, "Teacher, I'd like to recommend a few friends to join. Is that alright?"

True Monarch Starfire replied casually, "Auditing is fine."

In the following moments, cultivators began to cross the Spirit Realm and arrive at the classroom. The first to appear were those arranged by the Ten Great Universities and the Heavenly Court.

Tian Shengong of Immortal Armaments University's eyes flashed as he spotted True Monarch Starfire on the stage and Zhang Yu and the others below.

"So, Zhang Yu is also participating in this Sect Examination?"

With another glint in his eyes, Tian Shengong strode purposefully toward Zhang Yu.

"The path to victory in this Sect Examination has already appeared before me. I must..."

Tian Shengong's figure flickered, and he moved along the shortest path toward Zhang Yu.

Since the seats to Zhang Yu's left and right were already occupied by Yu Xinghan and Bai Zhenzhen, Tian Shengong's target was now the spot directly behind him.

"I must sit in the seat closest to Zhang Yu!"

But in the next instant, a dragon shadow abruptly materialized in front of Tian Shengong.

Tian Shengong's gaze narrowed as he stared at the figure. "Ying Mingchi of Celestial Monsters University? Has this guy seen the same path to success as I have?"

Ying Mingchi also noticed Tian Shengong vying for the same position and thought to himself, "As expected of the Sect Examination. The class hasn't even started, yet the competition has already begun? But Zhang Yu is a Human-Monster who has awakened his Monsterfolk Bloodline. The seat closest to him is mine!"

However, in the next moment, both of them froze. Zhang Yu waved his hand, and a projection materialized beside him.

"Myriad Laws University... Le Mulan?" Tian Shengong said resentfully. "What's her background? How did she manage to get a seat so close to Zhang Yu?"

Following her, more figures materialized around Zhang Yu one by one: Shi Huaiyu, Ying Xin, Shi Yunxiang, and others.

Then came Ye Xingli, Bei Wufeng, Jin Jun, and Yan Qianji.

Watching the seats around Zhang Yu fill up in an instant, Tian Shengong and Ying Mingchi could only find spots nearby.

Meanwhile, a message from Divine Monarch Nether Spring appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye: "True Monarch Blazing Light, my son Wang Yin is also attending this cram school. If you still harbor resentment over our past grievances, you can make any demand of me, his mother."

Zhang Yu: "Any demand?"

At the same time, Kuang Tianqing of Heavenly Demon University had taken a seat in the back row. Watching the elites of the Ten Universities appear one after another, he thought to himself, "These people were once rivals..."

Images of the Ten Greats League and the University War flashed through Kuang Tianqing's mind — scenes of the Ten Universities fiercely competing and undermining each other.

"And now, they've become allies."

Kuang Tianqing sighed inwardly. "Is it all because of the sects' oppression? Forcing cultivators from the same ecosystem to band together."

"They want to charge the sects together, to smash through the Sect Examination and force their way inside."
