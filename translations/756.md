# Chapter 756: Hymn of Heaven and Earth

"Synchronized with the latest sect curriculum, covering the preliminary, re-examination, and interview stages of the Sect Examination!"

"Personalized study plans, tailored for each student to overcome their weaknesses."

"And the most realistic simulated Sect Examinations, allowing you to experience the Examination Field atmosphere and adapt to the exam pace in advance. When you truly face the Examiners, you'll be calm and composed, staying ahead of your rivals."

In the livestream, Feng Tingting, who had accepted an advertising fee, was playing a commercial for the Starfire Sect Examination prep course. Responding to the flood of questions in the chat, she said, "I've attended True Monarch Starfire's lectures, and they're genuinely excellent."

"But the competition is too fierce this year, so I've decided to spend a year consolidating my skills and wait for next year's opportunity."

"It's also thanks to True Monarch Blazing Light and the others passing the interview that they secured future Sect Examination opportunities for us."

As she spoke, the image of her first meeting with Zhang Yu flashed through Feng Tingting's mind.

When Ye Xingli had introduced Zhang Yu to her back then, Feng Tingting had assumed he was a new Soul Cultivator Ye Xingli had purchased. She had even wondered why he was bought while still alive.

In the livestream, she continued, "I remember the first time I met True Monarch Blazing Light, I noticed he had no Bionics other than his Bionic Eyes."

"Even back then, I knew he was no ordinary person. Looking back now, his choice seems even more profound... It was likely a way to temper his physical body, forgoing the convenience of Bionics to constantly hone every inch of his flesh and refine his body refinement techniques."

"It must be this relentless dedication to physical cultivation, never slackening for a moment, that gave True Monarch Blazing Light such a huge advantage in the final body refinement test."

In the Songyang Hometown Group chat, despite being busy with studies, overtime, or part-time jobs, everyone had managed to spare a sliver of their consciousness to gather in the same Spirit Realm Space and watch the interview livestream together.

Song Hailong, once the top academic overachiever at Bailong High School, felt a surge of excitement as he watched Yu Xinghan pass the final interview. "Excellent! Truly worthy of the man who once defeated me to become Bailong's number one."

Lian Tianji watched the five who ultimately passed and thought to herself, "Zhang Yu didn't lie to me... They really passed. In the future, we can all take the Sect Examination."

Qian Shen, who had been classmates with Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, couldn't help but sigh as he looked at their avatars. "In the future, the Sect Examination score will become the ultimate evaluation system for Cultivators from the 1st to 10th Layers. Even students like Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen, who transcend conventional evaluation systems, can still be included within it."

Zhou Chechen and Lan Ling, former student council officers from Songyang High School, had also gathered for this rare occasion.

Lan Ling sent a private message: "Do you think they'd offer a higher price now if they asked us for dirt to report Zhang Yu?"

Zhou Chechen punched him lightly on the chest. "Even though we had some grudges with Zhang Yu back in high school..."

He looked at the final list of accepted candidates and sighed softly. "This is our chance... and everyone's chance in the future... to climb to the Apex of the Immortal Dao. How could we destroy it?"

Memories of their high school conflicts flashed through their minds — the anger, the humiliation of being repeatedly insulted... Now, all of it seemed so insignificant, even tinged with a strange sense of nostalgia.

Lan Ling said, "I was just saying. The Sect Examination... who wouldn't want to give it a try? Even if they offered me a mountain of gold, I wouldn't give up this chance. Heh, speaking of which, we played a small part in making the Sect Examination a regular thing, didn't we? Too bad no one knows."

Zhou Chechen replied, "It wasn't just this Sect Examination. We also contributed during the Heaven Collapse, the Ten Billion Heaven Mending, and the 'Wealth Pierces the Firmament!' event..."

Lan Ling suddenly laughed. "Didn't you say you never bought Yu Bonds or snatched Red Packets? So you did it secretly after all?"

Zhou Chechen froze for a moment, looking slightly uncomfortable. "Lan Ling... when I first started university, I still harbored a tiny, just a tiny, desire for revenge."

"But now..." He sighed. "I'm truly and utterly convinced."

"With all the earth-shattering deeds he's accomplished — holding back the Heaven Collapse for us, giving us a glimpse of the Apex of the Immortal Dao... even if I had to go back to high school and lose to him ten, even a hundred more times, I'd do it willingly."

In a low-pixel space within the Spirit Realm.

Ji Yuanshu, who had once been classmates with Zhang Yu and Yu Xinghan in the Civil Engineering Department, was also looking at the interview list.

He had heard that Sect Examination advertisements were everywhere now, but Ji Yuanshu couldn't see a single one.

He understood this was because he had become a Soul Cultivator, so all Sect Examination advertisements bypassed him, like wind passing without a trace, leaving no mark in his presence.

Looking at Zhang Yu's name on the list, Ji Yuanshu couldn't help but sigh softly. "To be born in the same era as you is a blessing. But for me... it is also a tragedy."

"If only I had been born a year later."

If he could go back in time, Ji Yuanshu would tell his past self: "Avoid his brilliance!"

And if he could add one more piece of advice, it would be: "Don't trade crypto, especially Jade Nectar Coin."

On the construction site, watching the screen showing Yu Xinghan's successful interview, Ping Han vibrated with excitement, only calming down after Fu Xinyao soothed him for a while.

Ping Han sighed, "Zhang Yu and the others have smashed open the Heavenly Gate. A pity I'll never have that chance in this lifetime."

"Xinyao, you're still young. You don't have to waste your life here like me. Work hard in the future, try to get out of the Overtime Institute early, and return to Joyful Union University. You might still have a chance to enter a sect."

Ping Han thought to himself that if Fu Xinyao managed to enter a sect in the future, he might have a chance to follow her and see what it is like.

Fu Xinyao, however, stared intently at Yu Xinghan's profile picture and suddenly said, "Doesn't this person look a bit familiar? I think he was one of our former clients."

For Ping Han, he couldn't recognize most of their clients. As he put it, back when he was working, it wasn't their faces he was interacting with.

But Yu Xinghan... he remembered him clearly. After all, he was Zhang Yu's friend, and Ping Han had known him back in the Civil Engineering Department.

Ping Han said, "We did interact with him."

---

On the Netherworld University campus, watching Yu Xinghan's final victory, Wang Yin shouted "Good!" three times.

Wang Yin: "Next year! That's when I'll enter a sect!"

Wang Yin understood that the competition for the Sect Examination would only grow fiercer each year, so he resolved to throw everything he had into next year's exam.

"A pity that old woman went up for training. It's not even convenient to transfer money anymore."

Thinking this, Wang Yin decided to see if he could ask Zhang Yu to help him contact Nether Spring up there. That way, he could squeeze some gold out of the old woman and further increase his chances of passing the Sect Examination.

---

Meanwhile, at Heavenly Sword University, Wen Wuya was looking at Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's names on the list. He thought to himself, "Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu, I will definitely catch up to you."

"I want to stand with you."

"Even better, to stand between you, connected to you both."

As the interview results were announced, Wen Wuya could feel the harsh criticisms that had plagued him for quitting his job to prepare for the exam suddenly fade away.

Clearly, Zhang Yu and the others breaking through the Heavenly Gate had garnered more support for all students planning to take the Sect Examination.

Within Wen Wuya's sect, some even suggested he find Bai Zhenzhen and follow her to the Heavenly Sword Sect, where he could work and prepare for the exam simultaneously.

Wen Wuya hesitated. "Should I stay down here and prepare full-time, or try to go up with A-Zhen..."

While countless people on Layers 1 through 10 were affected by the results of this Sect Examination...

The Flying Boat carrying Zhang Yu and the others had already soared through the clouds and was about to return to the Kunxu Fifth Layer.

Aboard the Flying Boat, Bai Zhenzhen and Le Mulan had once again suppressed the Sect Examination Clones within them with Zhang Yu's help, returning to normal.

Looking at Zhang Yu, Le Mulan told him about the outsourcing invitation she had received from the sect.

"They're inviting you up?" Zhang Yu's gaze flickered. His first thought was the possibility that Le Mulan's Longevity Extension ability had been discovered.

After a moment of thought, he asked, "What are your thoughts?"

Le Mulan replied, "I... I'm a little worried."

Zhang Yu nodded. "It's normal to be worried. To be honest... I don't recommend you accept this invitation either."

"You're not a sect disciple, after all. Outsourced workers have a low status up there. Once you become one of their contractors, they'll hold all the power, and we won't be able to help you."

Hearing this, Le Mulan looked at Zhang Yu with hopeful eyes. "Then... can I ascend to the sect with you?"

Le Mulan knew that if she could go up with Zhang Yu and the others, she would be their outsourced employee, under their protection.

Even without the interference of the Sect Examination Memories, Le Mulan still felt a deep sense of unwillingness about her failure.

She wanted to enter the sect, to glimpse the Apex of the Immortal Dao, to keep up with Zhang Yu.

If she could prepare for the exam within the sect, her chances of success when she returned to the lower layers for next year's Sect Examination would skyrocket.

Moreover, Zhang Yu had always aided her cultivation. In Le Mulan's eyes, even the several changes in her own physique were directly related to the constant stimulation from Zhang Yu.

But seeing Le Mulan's longing gaze, Zhang Yu said, "I'm sorry, Mulan. I've already promised Senior Sister Ye Xingli to take her into the sect."

Hearing these words, waves of bitterness washed over Le Mulan's heart. She thought to herself, "Is it because my performance was too poor this time?"

"Is my score so low that Zhang Yu doesn't want to take me with him?"

"Is my score no longer worthy of being Zhang Yu's companion?"

Le Mulan never imagined that one day... she would be rejected by Zhang Yu for having too low a score.

But on second thought, she found it perfectly normal. What right did someone of her level have to be friends with a Sect Scion?

Intense shame and anxiety flooded her, making her want to turn and flee immediately to avoid further humiliation and disappointment.

Yet, the desire for the Apex of the Immortal Dao burned like a fire in her heart, urging her to open her mouth and plead with Zhang Yu one more time.

"I... I can give you all my Spirit Coins. I can even repay the seed fees I owe you..." Le Mulan's lips parted, about to voice these words.

But before she could agonize further, Zhang Yu continued, "Don't worry, though. Given our relationship, I would never leave you behind in the lower layers."

He smiled at Le Mulan and said, "I've already arranged it with Yu Xinghan. When the time comes, he'll take you into the Myriad Laws Sect to find outsourcing work."

Hearing this, Le Mulan's eyes welled up slightly. Biting her lip, she looked at Zhang Yu and said, "Zhang Yu... I just thought you all looked down on me."

"How could we?" Zhang Yu replied. "Have you forgotten, Mulan? We're life-and-death companions. We've been together since we started university."

"I've said it before: if we die, we die together. If we go bankrupt, we go bankrupt together. I won't hoard future glory for myself."

Le Mulan nodded fiercely. "Next year, trust me, next year... I will definitely get into a sect!"

Zhang Yu said, "Of course I trust you."

Zhang Yu knew Le Mulan had the potential and talent. With a year of dedicated preparation, she would have a very good chance of joining a sect next year.

"Then Le Mulan can bring others up to the sect to prepare for the exams."

"And I can bring up another companion."

Hearing Zhang Yu's inner thoughts, Lady Fortune mused to herself, "This kid... he hasn't even truly entered the sect yet, and he's already planning to bring in his own people to cultivate his future power base. Unconsciously, by following me, he's learned quite a lot."

After exchanging a few words about entering the sect, Le Mulan asked another question: "Isn't Yu Xinghan planning to take anyone else up?"

"You mean Li Xuelian, right?" Zhang Yu said. "True Monarch Starfire will take her. They're father and daughter, after all. I think they're going up to see their family from before."

Just then, a message from Bai Zhenzhen appeared in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

Bai Zhenzhen: "Yu Zi, come look! So many people have come to the Fifth Layer to greet us!"

Zhang Yu's heart stirred. He realized this must be another promotional event arranged by the Heavenly Court to further amplify the impact of this Sect Examination.

A moment later, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen were walking hand-in-hand toward the bow of the Flying Boat, gazing at the crowd below in the Fifth Layer Sky.

At the same time, True Monarch Starfire, Yu Xinghan, and Kuang Tianqing stood beside them, also facing the crowd in the sky.

Le Mulan stood in the shadows behind them, watching Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen's backs. She yearned for the day she could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them.

"Next time... next time, I absolutely won't fail the exam again."

In Zhang Yu's eyes, the Fifth Layer Sky was already filled with a massive crowd. Above each person's head floated a series of projections, resembling a great fire burning across the heavens.

Some read "[Fist] Blazing Light [Fire]," others "[Fist] Starfire [Fire]," and still others included Bai Zhenzhen's Dao Title, "White Radiance."

Yu Xinghan and Kuang Tianqing's Dao Titles weren't well-known, so their names appeared directly.

Seeing this scene, Zhang Yu couldn't help but feel a jolt in his heart. The memory of him scattering Red Packets and leading the crowd to break through the firmament resurfaced in his mind.

But back then, he had been making a desperate gamble in a hopeless situation, chasing a sliver of hope amid despair.

Now, he was triumphant. Not only had he entered the Myriad Laws Sect and achieved a feat that set him above all others, but he had also infused a trace of his own will into Kunxu's first ten layers.

When Zhang Yu and the other four appeared, the crowd erupted in a series of cheers. Divine light and immortal music descended from the sky, while countless heavenly flowers and auspicious clouds spread out from the Spirit Realm.

The heavens and earth seemed to sing praises for these five examinees, and the Spirit Realm appeared to pay them homage.

Bathed in countless rays of light, Zhang Yu and the other four looked like immortals and gods descending to the mortal realm.

Deng Bingding descended from the sky and said to the five of them, "You five, thank you for setting an example for all living beings and for your contributions to normalizing the Sect Staff Selection Examination for Layers 1 to 10..."

Following her words, five beams of divine light descended from the firmament, enveloping Zhang Yu and the others.

Above the heads of Bai Zhenzhen and the other three, a projection appeared: "Outstanding Examinee of the First Sect Staff Selection Examination for Layers 1-10."

The text of the projection above Zhang Yu's head was even more magnificent and dazzling: "First Place Overall in the First Sect Staff Selection Examination for Layers 1-10."

This title became a commendation bestowed by the Heavenly Court. Zhang Yu could now freely display this projection anytime, anywhere, as long as he was connected to the Spirit Realm.

Watching this scene, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter sighed, "I doubt any future generation of Sect Staff will ever enjoy such glory as this one has today."

Beside him, True Monarch Miraculous Hand looked at the projection above Zhang Yu's head and remarked with some surprise, "In ancient times, wouldn't this be the equivalent of a Imperial Palace Examination Top Scorer?"
[TL note: Historically, the person who ranked first overall in the Imperial Palace Examination (the highest level of the civil service exams in ancient China) received this title. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangyuan]

After the Heavenly Court's commendation, Deng Bingding invited Zhang Yu to the sky to give a speech.

Looking at the crowd below and feeling the countless gazes from across the Spirit Realm, Zhang Yu paused for a moment... then finally spoke: "Everyone... go take the Sect Examinations!"

As Zhang Yu channeled his cultivation, his voice boomed like rolling thunder, sweeping across the land and echoing between heaven and earth, carrying far and wide.

"Go join the sects!"

"Go pass the examinations for the Myriad Laws Sect! The Heavenly Sword Sect! The Heavenly Demon Sect! The Vajra Sect! The Netherworld Palace! The Immortal Armaments Bureau..."

"Charge up to the Eleventh Layer, the Twelfth Layer, and even higher into Kunxu!"

"I'll be waiting for you there."

In that moment, Zhang Yu's voice seemed to drown out all other sounds in the world. After he finished speaking, the entire world fell silent for a brief instant.

But then... a tsunami of cheers erupted from all directions.

In that moment, Zhang Yu had ignited the burning desire in countless cultivators to charge toward the apex of the Immortal Dao.

Across Layers 1 to 10 of Kunxu, an untold number of cultivators resolved to pass the sect examinations in the future.

Deng Bingding watched the scene unfold silently, already envisioning the Sect Staff Selection Examinations becoming more brutal with each passing year.

But Deng Bingding knew... this was the only hope left for the lower layers. For those who wished to climb higher... it was a desperate measure, the only way.

"Twenty years? Thirty? Or forty? It won't be long before those from the upper levels reincarnate down here and grow strong enough to participate in the Sect Examinations of Layers 1 to 10."

Deng Bingding thought to herself, "These few short decades... this is the final window of opportunity. Once the Reincarnated Beings start taking the Sect Examinations here, they'll seize a massive number of spots and rapidly escalate the competition's intensity."

"The best chance for candidates from the lower layers to enter a sect... is to go all out and pass the examinations within these next twenty to forty years."

"And in the process, as they continuously raise the competitive intensity of the lower layers, they'll have a better chance of securing more spots when they eventually face the Reincarnated Beings."

"True Monarch Blazing Light, you must be thinking the same thing, right?"

Zhang Yu's thoughts at this moment were simple. To sum them up: "Silly children! Hurry up and take the exams! The Water Drop is coming!"

Meanwhile, Lady Fortune listened to Zhang Yu's speech and nodded repeatedly in her heart.

"Excellent, excellent. It's exactly right to encourage the cultivators of Layers 1 to 10 to seize this opportunity and pass the examinations."

"Regardless of their previous relationship with or opinion of Zhang Yu, once these cultivators from Layers 1 to 10 enter a sect, they will naturally stand on the same side as him, even in the same faction."

"In the future, as the Ten Great Sects recruit from the lower layers year after year, these people will become Zhang Yu's natural allies, perhaps even forming his core team."

"The more of these people there are in the sects, the better."

At the same time, True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter looked toward Zhang Yu and sighed, "Only by entering a sect can one have a chance at immortality. What Zhang Yu and the others broke through today wasn't just the opportunity to enter a sect, but a sliver of a chance at immortality itself."

True Monarch Miraculous Hand nodded and said, "Indeed. In the future, staying at the universities or joining giant corporations will no longer be the top choice for Ten Universities students. Perhaps freshmen will start preparing for the Sect Examinations as soon as they enroll."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter suddenly said, "I'm almost tempted to kill myself, reincarnate, and take the exams."

True Monarch Miraculous Hand initially thought he was joking, but when he turned and saw the solemn look in Heavenly Slaughter's eyes, he exclaimed in shock, "You can't be serious, can you? We don't have the methods of those Heavenly Chosen from the sects. If you reincarnate, you won't even remember who you are."

True Monarch Heavenly Slaughter remained silent, seemingly lost in hesitation.

Elsewhere, Tu Lishan looked at the promotion notice and thought to himself, "Head of the Civil Engineering Department?"

He understood that, thanks to his achievement of co-mentoring Zhang Yu and Yu Xinghan, two disciples now in the sects, with Divine Monarch Greenwood, the position of Department Head was inevitably his.

But after some thought, Tu Lishan decided to focus all his energy on the Sect Examinations instead.

"Besides... I'm already a Civil Engineering undergraduate, a Civil Engineering Master's student, a Civil Engineering Ph.D., and a Civil Engineering teacher. If I add 'Civil Engineering Department Head' to that list... I'm afraid I'll never be able to transport myself into a sect."

On a construction site, Xiang Shan's heart pounded as he replayed the final moments of Zhang Yu's victory. He thought to himself, "Monsterfolk martial arts... were the final key to passing the Sect Examinations?"

At Celestial Monsters University, Ying Mingchi watched the five figures standing at the bow of the ship. He knew that among these five new recruits, one had Monster Blood flowing through their veins. He thought to himself, "So, 20% of the lower layers' recruits are monsterfolk, and the exams included many monsterfolk-related questions. The Monsterfolk Sect Examination... it seems to have strong support from above. This might actually be a viable path."

Xiong Wenwu scanned the list of available positions, his gaze unconsciously drifting toward the Mounts category.

Ying Xin's consciousness connected to a cryo-chamber in the Spirit Realm, where she looked at her grandfather, frozen in a black-and-white stasis.

Through countless overtime sessions, her grandfather had unknowingly reached his Soul Cultivator's Lifespan Limit and entered a prolonged slumber.

Ying Xin left him a message: "Grandpa, thanks to the efforts of True Monarch Blazing Light and the others, the Sect Staff Selection Examination has become a regular event."

Ying Xin: "I'll be taking the Sect Examinations in the future too. The Ying Family might even produce a Sect Staff member one day."

While the storm of the Sect Examinations swept through Layers 1 to 10, somewhere on the Eleventh Layer of Kunxu...

Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole gazed at the light screen before her, which displayed the list of the Myriad Laws Sect's new recruits.

Her gaze swept over all the names, and True Monarch Magnetic Pole quickly locked onto Zhang Yu's name, followed by the names of Yu Xinghan and the others.

"Old Gao!" she exclaimed, grabbing Divine Monarch Greenwood beside her. "It's Zhang Yu! He got into the Edict Pavilion! Three people from the Myriad Laws Sect made it in this time!"

Divine Monarch Greenwood stared at Zhang Yu's name on the screen and remarked with emotion, "He really made it into the Myriad Laws Sect?"

Watching True Monarch Magnetic Pole's flickering figure, Greenwood asked, "Where are you going?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied, "The results are out. I'm going to ask Sinful Lotus and Nether Spring how their students did. We're old friends, after all. It's only right to show some concern."

Divine Monarch Greenwood thought to himself, "Are you really concerned about their results? You're just afraid they won't find out that Zhang Yu and the others got into the sect."
