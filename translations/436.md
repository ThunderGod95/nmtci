# Chapter 436: Team Withdrawal

Hearing Director Gao's words, Zhang Yu's heart stirred. He knew that the Civil Engineering Department's internal competition was a selection tournament organized by Myriad Laws University itself. The so-called "first place" representing the department in the Inter-University League was a rule established by the department to resolve factional disputes between the War Faction and the Peace Faction.

Theoretically, the team's roster could be adjusted to some extent.

However, this carried a hint of backroom deals and favoritism.

But Zhang Yu thought to himself that by then he would have already obtained his Military Certificate. Even if such adjustments were made, no one would likely gossip!

"It feels so good to use my own strength to get special treatment!"

Director Gao continued, "Alright, focus on recovering from your injuries now."

"If you have any problems and don't want to go to the hospital, try Xiao Qingxuan's treatments."

"But remember, Ancient Medical Techniques aren't fully aligned with the Immortal Dao. Many of their principles haven't been fully understood yet. Use your judgment!"

Zhang Yu asked, puzzled, "Use my judgment?"

Director Gao replied, "If it works, trust it. If it doesn't, stop!"

After completing the contract, Zhang Yu now had a monthly reimbursement allowance of 30 Spirit Coins!

On his way back to the dormitory, he was already planning how to spend the money.

"I definitely need Spirit Realm Services!"

"And I should also consider Potion and Daoist Arts services!"

"Sigh, artifact crafting materials aren't reimbursable... I'll have to cover other expenses and try to stretch these 30 Spirit Coins as far as possible!"

"I'll save any remaining Spirit Coins to further my artifact crafting skills!"

With a hint of resignation, Zhang Yu returned to his dormitory and immediately entered the Supreme Clarity Realm to resume his artifact crafting lessons. He thought to himself, "Once I get the Military Certificate, I'll need to focus on mastering the Seven Absolutes of Civil Engineering. I probably won't have much time for online courses then!"

Although he was likely to obtain the Military Certificate this time, Zhang Yu didn't let it go to his head.

After all, his ultimate goal was to compete in the Ten Great Leagues and gain admission to one of the Ten Great Sects!

To achieve that, he still felt like time was slipping through his fingers.

Especially after witnessing the battle between Mo Shangjin and Xuan Liangtian last year, he understood the immense gap between himself and the senior students who had mastered military-grade martial arts.

Mo Shangjin had also failed to defeat Celestial Monsters University and win first place in the Inter-University Civil Engineering League.

Above Mo Shangjin were even more elite students from top universities, majoring in their flagship programs and mastering military-grade Daoist Arts, military-grade bionics, military-grade magical artifacts... and even possessing Divine Spiritual Roots!

Zhang Yu sighed inwardly, "I'm still at least three or four levels below the true top tier of university students."

"If I want to successfully transfer to the Artifact Refinement Department during my university years, time is even tighter..."

With this thought, Zhang Yu's body tensed again. He seized the opportunity during his recovery period to study online courses in the Supreme Clarity Realm.

While Zhang Yu was diligently studying in secret, on a training field, a senior Civil Engineering student smiled at Ping Han and said, "Brother Han, you've got the Military Certificate locked down this time, right?"

Ping Han waved his hand. "The results haven't been announced yet."

The senior student insisted, "We all heard from the examinees — your performance was the best in the entire competition. If you don't get the Military Certificate, who else would?"

Ping Han cut him off. "Don't spread rumors. Let's wait for the official announcement."

Just then, another student asked, "Brother Han, what's your take on the future of the Jade Nectar Coin?"

Ping Han smiled confidently. "Divine Monarch Jade Nectar is a seasoned Soul Transformation expert backed by Joyful Union University. Dual Cultivation is an indispensable part of Immortal Dao technology, a fundamental need for countless cultivators..."

"Especially with Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's lottery starting tomorrow. With such bullish news, the coin's price will skyrocket again!"

"The Thousand Fellow Cultivators Assembly for the prize redemption will even be livestreamed — a thunderous announcement that marks a new chapter for the Dual Cultivation industry. It's creating a powerful siphon effect. Now is the window to strike gold!"

"If you want my advice, buy!"

"It's never too late to buy Jade Nectar Coins!"

The surrounding students nodded eagerly, listening with rapt attention, more focused than they ever were in class.

Mo Shangjin arrived to find the crowd gathered around Ping Han, listening intently as he discussed the Jade Nectar Coin.

Mo Shangjin frowned slightly at the scene. He cleared his throat and announced, "Time for training!"

After several reminders, he watched the competition team members reluctantly disperse. His frown deepened unconsciously.

Ping Han approached Mo Shangjin with a grin. "Old Mo, did you read the information I sent you?"

Mo Shangjin replied indifferently, "The Jade Nectar Coin's volatility is too high. I'm not playing that game."

Ping Han chuckled. "I know you're loyal to Myriad Laws University. You only buy our university's coins!"

"But you really should try drawing from Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's lottery and then participating in the Thousand Fellow Cultivators Assembly. The Jade Nectar Coin's value is guaranteed to skyrocket during that period — it's practically free money!"

Mo Shangjin waved him off. "Enough. Don't mention it again. And during training, stop talking about coin speculation with the others. It'll distract them."

In the following days, as rumors of Ping Han's Military Certificate spread through the Civil Engineering Department and the Jade Nectar Coin's value continued to rise, Mo Shangjin noticed a growing unease within the team.

During training, Mo Shangjin's teammates were constantly distracted, clearly keeping an eye on the fluctuating price of Jade Nectar Coin.

Some would stand there in a daze, while others would pester Ping Han with questions about cryptocurrency trading whenever they had a spare moment.

Several even asked Mo Shangjin for loans to increase their holdings of Jade Nectar Coin.

Even Ping Han... Mo Shangjin could sense his focus on training slipping. He was either chatting with people in the coaching group or posting online propaganda for Jade Nectar Coin.

Finally, one day, Mo Shangjin confronted him.

Ping Han retorted defiantly, "We've already secured first place in the Civil Engineering Competition. Why rush training?"

"We'd be better off borrowing more money and buying more Jade Nectar Coin!"

"The tangible gains from smart trading are far more reliable than your flimsy training exercises!"

After repeated failed attempts at reasoning, a heated argument erupted.

Ultimately, with a resounding thud, Ping Han was sent flying by a single palm strike from Mo Shangjin.

Mo Shangjin said coldly, "If you continue to disrupt the team's morale by obsessing over Jade Nectar Coins all day, then leave!"

Ping Han silently stood up, gave Mo Shangjin a deep look, and said slowly, "Mo Shangjin, what's wrong with me trying to help us all make money?"

"You missed your own chance. Do you want us to earn less too?"

"Get out!" Mo Shangjin roared.

An invisible force slammed Ping Han away with a deafening bang, sending him flying like a meteor for hundreds of meters before he crashed heavily to the ground.

Mo Shangjin glared at the remaining teammates. "Anyone else share his views? Leave now!"

"No? Then focus on training!"

Meanwhile, Ping Han slowly rose to his feet, his heart boiling with fury. "Mo Shangjin, you may be stronger now that you've mastered a military-grade martial art, but kicking me out won't matter!"

"Once I get my Military Certificate and master the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, I'll wait for you to beg me to return!"

Inside the dormitory, Zhang Yu moved through martial forms, gauging his physical condition.

"My injuries are about seventy to eighty percent healed," he thought. "Looks like I'll be able to return to the construction site tomorrow."

Just then, True Monarch Magnetic Pole sent him a message:

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: From now on, you'll receive 30 Spirit Coins per month for cultivation expenses. You can commission magical artifacts from Ye Xingli.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Ye Xingli will assign orders to you. You'll craft the artifacts yourself.

Zhang Yu's eyes flickered as he read the message. If this was how it worked, wouldn't both the artifacts and the funds to purchase them... belong entirely to him?

"At most, I'd just have to cover the material costs!" he mused. "This way, I can use the 30 Spirit Coins each month for artifact crafting!"

In the following days, Zhang Yu resumed his daily routine of shuttling between classrooms, the construction site, the Spirit Realm, and the Supreme Clarity Realm.

Classes, work, studying Civil Engineering knowledge, learning artifact crafting courses, and honing his artifact crafting skills... these activities consumed nearly every moment of his life.

With more abundant financial support, Zhang Yu felt his artifact crafting skills advancing by leaps and bounds. A bold idea began to take root in his mind.

Zhang Yu gazed at the Chain Formation Diagrams in the Treasure Appraisal Manual, a set of cultivation techniques for artifact refinement prodigies. He thought to himself, "Once I have more funds, I should definitely find time to try practicing an Artifact Refinement Technique!"

As Director Gao had predicted, the Civil Engineering Competition was indeed held earlier than usual.

Zhang Yu and Shi Huaiyu remained on the same team and participated in the first round of the qualifying competition.

The qualifying round was identical to the previous year: a high-speed sprint through a Chaotic Force Field, with the top twenty teams advancing.

The elimination matches for the top twenty teams were scheduled for several days later.

The match pairings had already been announced, and Zhang Yu was mildly surprised to see his opponent.

"Ma Xuan again?" Zhang Yu recalled their grueling battle from the previous year and reflected on his progress over the past year. "This time should be much easier," he thought.

Meanwhile, in Ma Xuan's competition group chat:

Ma Xuan: "Can you believe we're facing Zhang Yu again?"

Su Yanyang: "This time, I'll carry us to victory!"

Su Yanyang: "I've seen Zhang Yu's skills. His progress this year probably doesn't even compare to mine!"

Ma Xuan: "Haha! With our combined Minor Threefold Combination, we'll crush him and Shi Huaiyu!"

Ji Yuanshu watched the group chat, his heart stirring with excitement. "With Su Yanyang joining our team, we're sure to beat Zhang Yu's group. My overall score will catch up, and maybe even surpass his!"

Ma Xuan: "Let's discuss our specific tactics!"

Su Yanyang: "Ever since our last defeat, I've been meticulously studying Zhang Yu's fighting style. I've already devised a foolproof strategy!"

Su Yanyang: "His tactics are disgusting, but they have glaring weaknesses. Once we neutralize him, the rest of his team will be no match for us!"

Su Yanyang: "Besides, our cryptocurrency trading has significantly boosted our strength lately!"

Ma Xuan, Ji Yuanshu, and the other team members listened intently as Su Yanyang spoke with unwavering confidence. His analysis was razor-sharp, and his strategies were meticulously prepared. With each word, their confidence soared, and their spirits lifted!

But suddenly, Su Yanyang stopped sending messages!

Ma Xuan waited a while, then pinged him in the group chat, but there was no response.

He sent a direct message: "Old Su?"

Ma Xuan: "Where are you?"

After a long silence, Su Yanyang finally replied:

Su Yanyang: ...

Ma Xuan: "Speak clearly! Stop sending emojis! What's wrong?"

Su Yanyang: "The results of my Military Certificate are out."
