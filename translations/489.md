# Chapter 489: Soul Transformation Descent

Zhang Yu wondered inwardly, "What exactly is Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Yin Artifact trying to do?"

After deciding to use the Yin Artifact project to launder his cultivation and even orchestrate a scam, Zhang Yu had several conversations with Zhang Pianpian, learning many of the project's inner workings. He discovered that this Yin Artifact wasn't developed independently by Myriad Laws University but originated from Divine Monarch Jade Nectar herself.

A question had lingered in his mind: why had Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Yin Artifact chosen him?

Just then, Zhang Pianpian sent another message: she seemed to have heard the calls of other High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts and was searching for them.

After a pause, Zhang Pianpian replied again: she also said your aptitude is excellent, which is why you were chosen.

Seeing Zhang Pianpian's message, Zhang Yu's mind jolted, and he exclaimed inwardly, "I knew it!"

"I always knew I had a talent for this."

"If I had enrolled in Joyful Union University back then, my achievements probably wouldn't be any worse than they are now. I might even have become a Joyful Union Heavenly Chosen, discussing Dao with the Joyful Union Principal and conversing about profound mysteries with Divine Monarch Jade Nectar."

Hearing Zhang Yu's inner musings, Lady Fortune thought, "You're thinking about discussing profound mysteries? I'm almost embarrassed to call you out on it."

But when Zhang Yu recalled Joyful Union University's Yang Extremity Class and Yin Extremity Class, he shook his head, thinking, "Although my talent is exceptional, Joyful Union University's talent cultivation model still has some flaws. It's not quite right for me."

Zhang Yu still had questions for the Soul Transformation artifact spirit, but under True Monarch Magnetic Pole's surveillance, he couldn't send messages to Zhang Pianpian.

Suddenly, Zhang Yu had an idea. He touched the diamond-shaped crystal on his forehead and asked, "Would you like to cultivate with me again?"

Zhang Yu remembered that his contract specified that if he engaged in Dual Cultivation with a Yin Artifact, the price would be calculated separately, with a minimum of 15 Spirit Coins per session.

If he could operate it himself, he felt he could cultivate until the project team went bankrupt.

Unfortunately, this Soul Transformation Yin Artifact had never cooperated with him again, merely exchanging Magic Power before stopping completely each time.

Zhang Pianpian replied: She said no.

Zhang Pianpian: Because it would violate the non-interference agreement.

Hearing Zhang Pianpian's explanation, Zhang Yu's heart stirred. "There's such a thing? A non-interference agreement between Divine Monarch Seven Emotions and Divine Monarch Jade Nectar?"

"But is it because of the Azure Silk Flying Sword on me? Even removing it won't help — the artifact spirit has already recorded it?"

"This artifact spirit is too rigid!"

"But it's also because the artifact spirit is essentially offline now, right?"

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "According to standard procedure, triggering the non-interference agreement should prompt a report to Divine Monarch Jade Nectar, awaiting the Divine Monarch's decision."

"But since the artifact spirit can't report it, it's stuck on the first step."

Just as Zhang Yu was leaving the laboratory with the Yin Artifact artifact spirit, Fu Xinyao from Joyful Union University, reported by Yu Xinghan, was directly taken into custody by the patrol team and sent to the detention chamber.

She cursed inwardly, "I was offering the lowest prices! How could those Civil Engineering students report me? These students here know nothing of Dual Cultivation etiquette."

Ping Han sighed helplessly.

A patrol team member glanced at Fu Xinyao, snorted, and said, "Azure River Arts Vocational College? Junior College student?"

This was Fu Xinyao's false identity for this mission. Thanks to the fake identity arranged by Divine Monarch Jade Nectar and the concealment seals placed on the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact, they wouldn't be exposed as long as they didn't cause too much trouble.

But when the patrol team member ordered them to perform compulsory overtime service, Fu Xinyao refused. She had come to Myriad Laws University for a crucial mission and couldn't afford to be detained for extra work.

However, refusing meant paying a fine.

Unwilling to pay the fine herself, Fu Xinyao contacted her superiors to request funds for the penalty.

Just then, Ping Han suddenly said, "I sense the artifact spirit's call."

Fu Xinyao's eyes flickered. She knew that the so-called "artifact spirit's call" was actually Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Yin Artifact transmitting messages on a specific Spirit Realm frequency.

Such messages could only be received by artifact spirits using the same frequency, those also belonging to Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Yin Artifacts.

Fu Xinyao asked, "Did you all sense it too?"

Apart from Ping Han, the other Soul Cultivators within the artifact spirit unanimously confirmed.

Fu Xinyao said, "Then report it to the Divine Monarch."

As Zhang Yu walked, he followed the Jade Nectar Maiden's directions while simultaneously reading a textbook titled "Magic Artifact Testing Technology" through his Bionic Eye.

This was a fourth-year textbook from the Artifact Refinement Department, which Zhang Yu had recently begun studying in his spare time.

Moments like this, during brief breaks, were perfect opportunities for him to learn.

On one hand, he could use every spare moment to study and become stronger. On the other hand, he could prevent the ritual from becoming unstable due to his lack of focus on learning or cultivation, which might cause unnecessary trouble.

By the time Zhang Yu had rapidly read through nearly half the book, he had reached the fifth underground level of Myriad Laws University City, following behind a Yellow Turban Warrior transporting goods.

The Jade Nectar Maiden remarked, "Some of the calls are coming from inside that thing."

"But... why is it working?" she continued. "They escaped to avoid work, so why are they still working after getting out?"

"And why is everyone we've seen so far working?"

Zhang Pianpian replied, "What's wrong with that?"

The Jade Nectar Maiden countered, "We originally thought humans created artifact spirits to avoid work themselves, to have the spirits do the work for them."

Jade Nectar Maiden: So, whether you're an artifact spirit or a human, you still have to work?

Zhang Pianpian replied: All living beings in this world must work to survive. It's the natural order.

Zhang Pianpian: To transcend this order, one must attain enlightenment and become an Immortal, escaping the cycle of birth, death, and reincarnation. Only then can one be free from labor and free from flaws.

Zhang Pianpian: Only when you reach that stage — when you've achieved financial freedom and cultivation freedom — will you no longer need to work.

Jade Nectar Maiden: No... that's not right.

Jade Nectar Maiden: I don't remember... but what you're saying is wrong!

Sensing Jade Nectar Maiden's rising agitation, Zhang Pianpian immediately reassured her: Don't get upset. What I'm saying might not be entirely correct.

Meanwhile, as Zhang Yu followed the Yellow Turban Warrior through the underground factory, Jade Nectar Maiden felt the calls of more artifact spirits.

At the same time, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's voice echoed in Zhang Yu's ear:

Zhang Yu, stop. Don't go any further.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole, who had been monitoring Zhang Yu's movements, had secretly inspected the entire factory's equipment and personnel as soon as Zhang Yu entered the factory area.

At that moment, as information from the Spirit Realm surged, Zhang Yu felt a thunderous roar erupt within his Bionic Eye.

The illusory projection of the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda descended from the sky, sealing off the entire factory area.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole laughed heartily. "I never imagined a group of artifact spirits would dare to sneak in here."

"Since you've come, you'll all stay."

With a wave of her right hand, chains rained down from the heavens, ensnaring everyone within the factory. In an instant, managers, assembly line workers, Junior College Students, and Soul Cultivators alike were bound tightly.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole singled out several individuals.

"Hmm?" Her gaze narrowed slightly. "Low-Intelligence Artifact Spirits?"

Under her relentless interrogation, she discovered they were followers of the Dual Rest Cult.

Their reason for joining the cult was simple: the Dual Rest Cult promised them ten minutes of rest each month in exchange for their membership. During those ten minutes, the cult would provide replacements to cover their work.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole believed that the entities working for them must be High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts.

However, before she could seal off the area, these High-Intelligence Spirit Artifacts had already departed, leaving behind only a group of artifact spirits with rudimentary intelligence to continue summoning the Jade Nectar Maiden.

"The Dual Rest Cult..." True Monarch Magnetic Pole murmured inwardly. "So the escaped artifact spirits have indeed joined forces with them. Are they using those ten minutes of monthly rest time to bewitch people and lure them into the cult?"

"But why summon the artifact spirits?"

Magnetic Pole wondered, "What's the purpose of deliberately drawing me here?"

Just then, the Spirit Realm trembled violently.

Amidst a cascade of radiant light descending from the heavens, a woman descended from the Spirit Realm. Her features and form were indistinct, yet she radiated an immeasurable allure.

The moment Zhang Yu saw her, a searing pain shot through his Bionic Eye. The overwhelming light and torrent of information pushed the Bionic Eye's processing capacity beyond its limits.

The Jade Nectar Maiden cried out in terror, "It's her... she's here!"

Zhang Pianpian sent an urgent message: "Soul Transformation! Run!"

Zhang Yu groaned and immediately removed his right Bionic Eye, finally relieving the pain from the overwhelming information overload.

But the next moment, he watched as the factory before him was rocked by intermittent explosions, as if invisible hands were sweeping through, tearing the Physical World into chaos.

Lady Fortune warned, "A Soul Transformation being has descended, interfering with the Material Realm through the Spirit Realm. Cutting off the network is useless — it only leaves us blind!"

Zhang Yu's heart jolted. He felt utterly blind.

Though violent changes were unfolding right before his eyes, he could see nothing, hear nothing.

"Lady Fortune is right," Zhang Yu thought. "Without connecting to the Spirit Realm, we won't even know what's happening. We might be wiped out by a stray wave of divine power from the Soul Transformation being."

Reattaching the Bionic Eye and reconnecting to the Spirit Realm, Zhang Yu heard a soft chuckle.

"Little one, this Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda of yours is quite impressive. It actually blocked my Primordial Spirit power earlier?"

At the same moment, Zhang Yu saw in the Spirit Realm vision that he was completely enveloped by the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda.

Outside the Nine Heavens Primordial Yang Pagoda, a violent storm raged. Countless souls were being extracted and swirled endlessly above the factory.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole said coldly, "Divine Monarch Jade Nectar, are you attacking Myriad Laws University?"

Divine Monarch Jade Nectar chuckled softly. "I've come to retrieve my Yin Artifact and capture the little thief who stole it."

In the next moment, Zhang Yu saw an unknown Yin Artifact rise from the void ahead, emitting a terrifying suction force.
