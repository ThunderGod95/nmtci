# Chapter 556: How Will People Know I Have an Artifact Refinement Military Certificate If I Don't Tell Them?

Although the classmates in the Songyang Hometown Group were enthusiastic, their average spending power remained relatively low.

Seeing the lukewarm response in the group, Zhang Yu posted again: The company may be expanding soon and needs to recruit many Soul Cultivators. If anyone is interested, please contact me.

This message immediately set the group abuzz, with many members sending Zhang Yu their resumes.

After all, the Songyang Hometown Group already had a significant number of Soul Cultivator students, and their ranks had swelled further following the recent economic crisis.

Now that Zhang Yu was offering job opportunities, waves of applicants immediately began competing for the positions.

After leaving the Hometown Group, Zhang Yu decided he should target wealthier individuals to promote his artifact refinement services.

After posting a screenshot of his Military Certificate on his social media, Zhang Yu first contacted President Wang.

Zhang Yu: President Wang, did you see my post?

Zhang Yu: I got my Artifact Refinement Department Military Certificate. If you need any artifact refinement services, feel free to contact me.

Wang Yin: I'm currently on Kunxu Level 3. Message relaying takes time, so I can't respond immediately.

Zhang Yu paused, slightly surprised. Kunxu Level 3? Has President Wang already started his graduate studies?

Soon after, on the third level of Kunxu, within the graduate student campus of Netherworld University, Wang Yin's gaze sharpened as he saw the message relayed from the second level of the Spirit Realm.

He activated the company's cross-level communication channel, temporarily connecting to the Spirit Realm on Kunxu's second level. Then, he opened Zhang Yu's social media profile and saw the Artifact Refinement Department's Military Certificate, causing him to jolt.

Next, he noticed Zhang Yu was selling a used Bionic Eye.

"My Time-Worn Demonic Eye? What the hell... this kid's only selling it now after using it all this time?"

Wang Yin's expression turned complex as he watched this unfold.

"Excellent, Zhang Yu. Seeing your cultivation progress and relentless advancement has reignited my determination."

His dao heart surged fiercely, feeling layers of inspiration. Finally, he made a firm resolution: "Within the next year, I will obtain my Golden Core Certificate!"

"After this year's Ten Greats League, the conflicts between universities will inevitably escalate further. I fear that every school except the Ten Great Universities will erupt into a cataclysmic war. That will be my moment to shine."

He then sent Zhang Yu a message: "Zhang Yu, you're at Myriad Laws, I'm at Netherworld."

Wang Yin: "Our battle is inevitable."

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu had already sent a message to Wen Wuya.

Wen Wuya: Can you refine Yin Artifacts?

Wen Wuya wondered if Zhang Yu had learned the intricacies of the Soul Transformation Bionic during his participation in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's experiments.

Zhang Yu, observing this exchange, fell into deep contemplation.

"Is the demand for Yin Artifacts really this high? And I still have the reputation from participating in the Soul Transformation Bionic experiments..."

"Should I consider learning this skill in the future?"

In addition to the wealthy Wang Yin and Wen Wuya, Zhang Yu also sent messages to the Heavenly Chosen he had met from various universities during the Civil Engineering Competition.

Vajra University - Chan Rong: Thank you for your concern, but I still believe my body, forged through countless trials, is more reliable.

Chan Rong: President Zhang, if you need materials for artifact refinement, feel free to buy them from me. I'll give you a 20% discount.

In the eyes of this Vajra University student, Zhang Yu had already become a figure of immense wealth.

Immortal Armaments University - Wan Gouxuan: I only use Extreme Tiger.

Wan Gouxuan: President Zhang, would you be willing to have Myriad Laws represent Extreme Tiger?

Heavenly Sword University - Yue Guanqiong: You're already at the top of the Artifact Refinement Department, so money shouldn't be an issue, right? Could you repair the flying sword you damaged last time?

Zhang Yu immediately blocked Yue Guanqiong.

Just then, Zhang Pianpian sent a message, resuming their discussion about Zhang Yu obtaining his Military Certificate.

Zhang Yu's heart stirred as he asked the question that had been on his mind since he first saw her in the top 50 group chat:

Zhang Yu: Senior Sister, will you be participating in the next Ten Greats League?

Zhang Pianpian: No.

Zhang Pianpian: I'm likely going to be recommended for graduate studies soon.

Zhang Yu's heart skipped a beat: Skipping a grade?

Zhang Pianpian: Yes. I'll probably spend some time on the third layer first.

Zhang Pianpian: After completing the foundational studies, I'll be able to travel between the third and second layers through project connections.

Zhang Pianpian thought to herself, "The next Ten Greats League is too dangerous. If someone of my status gets involved, the consequences would be even more unpredictable."

In her view, participating in the next Ten Greats League... the risks far outweighed the potential rewards.

Especially given the complex situation, which involved not only the Ten Great Universities and the Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs, but also the looming shadows of sects, Evil Gods, and the Demonic Sect.

"It's too chaotic, too unpredictable, and too uncontrollable."

Zhang Pianpian had considered warning Zhang Yu, but remembering that while her younger brother possessed extraordinary innate talent, reaching the competition level within half a year would likely be beyond his capabilities, she decided against it.

At the same time, Zhang Yu received a communication request from Bai Zhenzhen.

The two met in the Spirit Realm. Bai Zhenzhen excitedly hugged Zhang Yu, celebrating his success in obtaining his second Military Certificate.

After they parted, Bai Zhenzhen watched Zhang Yu's figure fade away and said proudly, "See? Zhang Yu is amazing, right? He's improving faster and faster."

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions replied calmly, "He is quite fast."

"But there's only half a year left. Even if Divine Monarch Jade Nectar drags him off to repair things every day, he'll never catch up to you."

"Let alone achieve anything in the Ten Greats League."

"It's even questionable whether he'll be able to participate at all."

After ending the call with Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu remembered he hadn't messaged his Master yet.

Although True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Director Gao likely already knew about his Military Certificate, he still sent them separate messages to report personally.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: Good. Keep up the good work.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole: [1 Spirit Coin]

Seeing the 1 Spirit Coin, Zhang Yu's heart filled with joy. He knew that his Master rarely gave out Spirit Coins unprompted, which meant she was genuinely pleased with his achievement, despite her typically aloof demeanor.

Director Gao: Good

Director Gao: Come visit the construction site more often when you have time.

Director Gao: There are many projects here now. I've been keeping an eye out for several good ones for you.

Zhang Yu: Thank you, Teacher. I'll come as soon as I finish my current tasks.

After ending his calls, Zhang Yu sent a message to Zi Yunzhen:

Zhang Yu: Xiao Zi, still playing at the construction site? Come back to work.

In the following days, Zhang Yu devoted himself entirely to refining the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

He aimed to quickly advance it to Level 20 and unlock its military-grade capabilities, allowing him to swiftly monetize his Military Certificate.

While Zhang Yu was diligently refining the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, the Nine Nether Demon Eye crafted by Ye Xingli arrived three days later.

After removing the Time-Worn Demonic Eye and installing the Nine Nether Demon Eye for Zhang Yu, Ye Xingli asked, "How does it feel?"

Zhang Yu blinked, immediately noticing the world appearing much clearer. As his pupils contracted and dilated, he could discern the incredibly fine textures on Ye Xingli's skin.

"No... not textures, but micro-etched Magic Power Circuits."

"The Nine Nether Demon Eye's vision is far superior to the Time-Worn Demonic Eye."

"Technology is advancing so rapidly."

Next, Zhang Yu activated the Nine Nether Demon Eye's crucial function: the Soul Body Induction module.

In the next moment, Zhang Yu's vision blurred, and multiple shadowy figures materialized around Ye Xingli.

These were swirling, mist-like entities that radiated a bone-chilling cold and contorted into grotesque expressions.

"So this is what Soul Cultivators look like through the Nine Nether Demon Eye's Soul Body Induction?"

"These Soul Cultivators must be assisting Senior Sister in operating her Bionics."

Zhang Yu recalled that Mo Shangjin's Seven Absolutes Bionic had also used numerous Soul Cultivators to assist with various functions, allowing the cultivator to simultaneously perform multiple Bionic operations.

As Zhang Yu observed the several twisted souls clinging to Ye Xingli's Bionics, he discovered that whenever his gaze lingered on a particular Soul Cultivator, he could instantly activate the Nine Nether Demon Eye's Water of Forgetfulness system, attempting to freeze the entity's consciousness.

"But Senior Sister's Bionics likely have strong Spirit Realm defenses. My Nine Nether Demon Eye probably can't break through."

Zhang Yu understood that while the Nine Nether Demon Eye could target Soul Cultivators within others' Bionics, its primary purpose was to protect his own magical artifacts and Bionics by freezing Soul Cultivators attacking from the Spirit Realm.

As Zhang Yu's gaze lingered, the companies to which these Soul Cultivators belonged also materialized, prompting him to nod slightly.

Zhang Yu knew that by activating the Nine Nether Demon Eye's soul cleansing function and filing complaints and reports with the companies employing the Soul Cultivators, he could force them to recall the Soul Cultivators to the Spirit Realm.

Of course, his complaints and reports had to be substantiated with evidence.

"The more we understand about these Soul Cultivators and the more evidence we gather — especially concrete proof of their violations — the more effective the soul cleansing will be."

Ye Xingli asked, "What do you think? Should we take a walk around the city and test your compatibility?"

Zhang Yu nodded slightly. "Alright."

"Xiao Zi, keep washing the materials while I'm gone," Zhang Yu instructed Zi Yunzhen before heading out with Ye Xingli into the streets of University City.

The city now appeared different to Zhang Yu.

He noticed that teachers and students alike were each accompanied by one or more Soul Cultivators.

Simultaneously, he spotted Soul Cultivators flashing through the air like lightning bolts, streaking toward distant destinations.

Others flickered within the Primordial Magnetic Channels, assisting with channel sensing.

Some lurked behind advertisements, responsible for intelligent targeting.

Still others paced in front of shops, transmitting promotional information to the Bionic Eyes of passersby.

"This University City is truly..."

As Zhang Yu gazed at the dense swarm of Soul Cultivators working tirelessly from top to bottom, inside and out, a sense of awe washed over him.

He felt that whenever he thought he had grasped the essence of University City, his own progress and evolution would peel back another layer of its facade, revealing a more authentic glimpse of the city's true nature.

"Even now, I doubt I've seen more than a fraction of University City's true face," he mused.

Ye Xingli, standing beside him, asked, "How is it? No lag even with so many Soul Cultivators on screen, right?"

"Other universities might struggle, but Myriad Laws has such high density and a particularly large number of Soul Cultivators on screen that I've optimized the performance specifically for this. Even many high-end Bionic Eyes can't match it."

Zhang Yu nodded in satisfaction. "No issues."

With that, he deactivated the Soul Body Induction function. After all, keeping it active constantly drained Magic Power, and the more Soul Cultivators it detected, the faster the drain.

Back in the laboratory, Zhang Yu resumed refining the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

A week later, as mid-February approached, Zhang Yu finally upgraded the Heavenly Sun Radiance God to Level 20 and unlocked all its military-grade capabilities.
