# Chapter 494: Why Is Extreme Tiger, So Talented, Being Looked Down Upon?

As the fiend energy spread, Zhang Yu's palm seals shifted, unleashing torrents of earth-shattering Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

"I can't defend against fiend energy," he declared. "But I can reshape heaven and earth!"

With a thunderous roar, the central arena floor erupted in massive fissures under the influence of the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, splitting the battlefield in two like a deep canyon.

"Rise!" Zhang Yu roared, and the ground on Myriad Laws University's side trembled violently. The tremors intensified, and with Zhang Yu's channeled energy, the entire section of earth slowly began to rise.

"Lift the mountain!"

In the blink of an eye, Zhang Yu had raised a vast section of earth, creating layered walls that blocked the fiend energy's advance.

Wan Gouxuan's gaze sharpened. "Level 20 Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power."

"And... executed flawlessly. It's as if he's studied this Cultivation Art for years, practicing it countless times."

"Is this entirely due to Joyful Union University's Immortal Dao Technology? Or is Zhang Yu's Martial Dao talent truly extraordinary?"

In the Spirit Realm's spectator stands, Director Gao nodded in satisfaction. "Zhang Yu has unleashed the true power of his Level 20 Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power. It's hard to believe he only recently mastered it."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole smiled faintly. "You've taught him well."

Director Gao replied, "My teaching alone couldn't have brought him this far. Your experiments gave him the final push, allowing him to soar to new heights in his third year."

Just as Zhang Yu was altering the terrain to contain the fiend energy, a massive figure over ten meters tall slowly emerged from the Immortal Armaments University's formation. It was the Earth Surge God, the Civil Engineering Department's Giant Military-Grade Puppet.

With each step the Earth Surge God took, the surrounding terrain violently transformed. Valleys became hills, and high ground turned into deep pits. The earth seemed to rise and fall with the giant puppet's breath, its form warping with every tremor within the Earth Surge God's core.

Wan Gouxuan, piloting the Earth Surge God from within, couldn't help but take a deep breath, marveling inwardly, "How long... has it been since I operated this from inside?"

He recalled his past construction and combat missions, where he had always simultaneously controlled the Earth Surge God while protecting it from external damage. Since acquiring this Giant Military-Grade Puppet, Wan Gouxuan had never dared to run it at full power.

"Today... I can finally unleash its full potential and go all out, regardless of the cost."

At the same time, his mind flashed back to his deep-seated grudge against Mo Shangjin and the humiliating mockery he had endured last year from the Civil Engineering students of Myriad Laws University.

"I just don't understand! Extreme Tiger is such a superior brand — so many people around me use it! Why do you look down on it?!"

As he spoke, the Earth Surge God had already begun to sprint. With each stride, the ground beneath its feet vibrated in sync with the Earth Vein Vibration Joints, transforming the terrain into surging waves that propelled the Earth Surge God forward with relentless momentum.

With a thunderous boom, the Earth Surge God, towering over ten meters tall, instantly shattered the sound barrier. A shockwave of air rippled across the arena, whipping up sand and debris as the colossal machine charged toward the Myriad Laws University team with savage ferocity.

*Boom!*

The Earth Surge God's strike shattered the earth Zhang Yu had raised.

Zhang Yu retaliated, summoning massive slabs of rock that crashed down like mountain peaks.

*Bang!*

An invisible force field seemed to emanate from the Earth Surge God, pulverizing the approaching rock formations into dust.

If Zhang Yu's attacks were like uprooting mountains and shifting the earth, the Earth Surge God, under Wan Gouxuan's control, was akin to shattering mountains and splitting the earth.

The moment they clashed, a terrifying battle erupted, transforming the center of the arena into a scene of utter chaos in mere moments.

Under the influence of the Earth Surge God, the rampaging fiend energy surged relentlessly toward Myriad Laws University's territory, only to be repeatedly blocked by the towering earthworks Zhang Yu raised.

As the fierce combat drew the two combatants closer, Wan Gouxuan abruptly activated the Mountain Vein Manifestation of the Earth Surge God.

Over ten thousand units of Magic Power erupted from his Power Dantian, transforming into a surging wave of Gang Qi that spread outward, merging with the spiritual energy in the atmosphere to form a Dharma Aspect over a hundred meters tall.

Suddenly, a colossal giant seemed to materialize in the arena, its roaring presence filling the air as it brought its fist crashing down on the nearby Zhang Yu.

Wan Gouxuan roared inwardly, "Overpowering the Earth Surge God like this will cost at least a hundred Spirit Coins in repairs after this match."

"Can you withstand this?"

Amidst the thunderous roar,

From the fist of the Mountain Vein Manifestation, a hundred-meter-high plume of dust erupted, spreading across the arena in a sweeping shockwave.

Simultaneously, the earth trembled violently from the impact, causing the entire arena to shudder. The distant, echoing crash reverberated deep into the underground depths of Immortal Armaments University.

But in the next instant, golden flames erupted skyward as Zhang Yu's Gang Qi surged explosively. He transformed into a five-meter-tall Mountain-Moving Warrior, his massive form dominating the arena.

It was in this Mountain-Moving Warrior state, supported by the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, that he had withstood the Earth Surge God's attack. The Triple Protective Qi had mitigated the force, while the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force's techniques and his own formidable physical defenses had allowed him to endure the blow.

His body, enhanced by the Martial Dao Holy Body, could now unleash a variety of Martial Dao powers. Moreover, thanks to the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo, his physique possessed aspects of the University Holy Body, Civil Engineering Holy Body, and Qi Meridian Everflow.

Wan Gouxuan watched in astonishment, his heart pounding. "This guy... he actually took the Mountain Vein Manifestation's full-power strike head-on?"

Wan Gouxuan knew that under normal circumstances, a Giant Military-Grade Puppet, with its overwhelming size, would always dominate individuals of the same cultivation realm in terms of power, strength, and mass, much like an elephant crushing a mouse.

Especially since his opponent possessed only one military-grade martial art, Wan Gouxuan was confident that his Earth Surge God, operating at full power, would easily overwhelm it.

Meanwhile, on the other side, Zhang Yu exhaled slowly, gazing at the Military-Grade Puppet looming before him. He smiled faintly. "Funny, I was just thinking I wanted to get closer and fight you."

In the next instant, the Mountain-Moving Warrior roared wildly and charged toward the Earth Surge God.

The Mountain Vein Manifestation stomped forward, its mountain-like foot crashing down with tremendous force.

*Bang!*

With a deafening crash, the Mountain-Moving Warrior raised its massive palms skyward, bracing against the Mountain Vein Manifestation's crushing strike.

Zhang Yu took a deep breath, and the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force within the Mountain-Moving Warrior surged violently.

Since mastering the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, Zhang Yu had primarily relied on this military-grade cultivation technique for both construction and combat.

The Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force, which he had painstakingly cultivated for years, had rarely seen use.

It wasn't that Zhang Yu didn't want to use the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force, but the Earthly Fiend Gravity, activated by the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, was far too powerful, exceeding the capacity of his Gang Qi and physical body.

Rather than using the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force, it was more effective to directly unleash the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

But now... as his physical body adapted to the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo, it gradually gained more enhancements from the Chain Method Diagram Set, becoming increasingly resilient.

His Gang Qi, repeatedly amplified and refined by the Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill, had also achieved a carrying capacity far surpassing its previous limits.

Thus, when Zhang Yu activated the Mountain-Moving Warrior and golden flames roared to life, the Gang Qi of the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force surged violently, violently repelling the Mountain Vein Manifestation's just-unleashed strike.

With a deafening, earth-shattering roar, Zhang Yu's counterattack slammed into the Mountain Vein Manifestation's leg.

The Mountain Vein Manifestation's temporary body, composed of Gang Qi and spiritual energy, had never been known for its durability. The impact shattered it instantly, exploding into a swirling vortex of chaotic energy.

But this was only the first strike!

As the Mountain Vein Manifestation's leg disintegrated, Zhang Yu charged forward, closing the distance to within ten meters of the Earth Surge God.

At the same time, amidst the howling wind, the Mountain Vein Manifestation's colossal palm slammed down toward him.

Even with his rapidly advancing strength, Zhang Yu could only deflect one strike from the Mountain Vein Manifestation at a time, due to the Manifestation's sheer immensity.

This was the second strike he had just stored.

The Mountain-Moving Warrior unleashed a punch, its golden body surging violently as if unable to withstand the consecutive impacts. With a thunderous explosion, it shattered into a shower of golden light, shrinking by approximately 18%.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu's physical body, both internally and externally, erupted in a network of wounds, which then struggled to close under the regenerative effects of his activated flesh.

Clearly, even with his current power, he couldn't deflect the Mountain Vein Manifestation's force without significant strain, and his counterattacks were severely limited.

Yet simultaneously, the Manifestation's descending palm shattered with a deafening roar, unleashing another violent gust of wind.

With two consecutive strikes that shattered the Mountain Vein Manifestation's defenses, Zhang Yu closed within three meters of the Earth Surge God.

Inside the Mountain-Moving Warrior's body, the Void Apertures specifically designed to store power within the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force suddenly surged to life.

Throughout the recent battle, Zhang Yu had also accumulated a significant amount of explosive force from the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

In that instant, the Mountain-Moving Warrior unleashed both palms simultaneously.

On one side, the power of the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force, amplified by the Ten Phases of Suppressing Stars technique, erupted like a white comet from Zhang Yu's palm, its surging energy sweeping through the atmosphere.

On the other side, fueled by the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power and also employing the Ten Phases of Suppressing Stars, a terrifying Earthly Fiend Gravity vortex threatened to devour all in its path. Accompanied by billowing dust clouds, it coalesced into a pitch-black domain.

Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power — Comet Strike X Star Dust Bind!

The two opposing forces, one white and one black, surged like celestial bodies as the Mountain-Moving Warrior hurled them fiercely toward the Earth Surge God.

Wan Gouxuan barely had time to fully activate the Earth Surge God's Earth Vein Vibration Joints, raising layer upon layer of rock to shield himself, before channeling all his power into his Power Dantian.

In the next instant, two stars — one black, one white — smashed through the rock layers as if shattering the heavens, completely pulverizing the Earth Surge God's defenses.

Bang!

As the Earth Surge God's seismic force field erupted, its massive hand collided violently with the two stars.

Wan Gouxuan's Bionic Eye vision instantly flooded with red warnings and repair alerts.

His heart clenched for a moment, then relaxed. Only one thought remained in his mind: "Good thing... good thing the repair costs are covered."

In the next instant, a towering cloud of dust engulfed both figures.

In the audience stands, Director Gao's eyes gleamed with astonishment. "Zhang Yu... when did he learn to unleash the combined power of the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force and the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Shifting Divine Power?"

"His Martial Dao talent is even more astonishing than I initially predicted."
