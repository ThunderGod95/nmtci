# Chapter 566: True Monarch Magnetic Pole Treasures Her Disciple Too Much

True Monarch Magnetic Pole repeatedly scanned Zhang Yu's design, but found that even with her profound foundation, cultivation, and years of experience in artifact refinement, she couldn't immediately suggest any improvements.

At most, she could offer minor adjustments to certain details, but this might stem from her unfamiliarity with Junior College students and the design principles of this market.

Worse still, the design resonated with her deeply, every ingenious detail aligning perfectly with her own sensibilities.

"Technically speaking, these boots have achieved the pinnacle of performance-to-cost balance within the Qi Refining Realm."

"Any boots with superior performance would inevitably be more expensive."

"Conversely, cheaper boots would inevitably compromise on performance."

"If I were to create a similar magical artifact, I would likely design it exactly this way."

A question couldn't help but form in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's mind: "Did Zhang Yu truly design this himself?"

"Did he hire someone else?"

Yet, upon closer examination of the design, she realized that creating such a sophisticated design would require more than just hiring a random person.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole then inquired about Zhang Yu's design philosophy and discussed specific details with him.

As Zhang Yu explained his design process and sent additional blueprints, True Monarch Magnetic Pole was struck with astonishment.

Examining the blueprints, she immediately realized that Zhang Yu had likely created them all himself.

Even if he had hired someone, it was impossible for them to produce so many detailed designs.

Moreover, despite their seemingly wild and unconventional nature, the designs shared a consistent underlying style.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole could even discern a clear progression: as the designer gained a deeper understanding of Junior College Students and mastered the art of incorporating "Junior College Content," their design style matured significantly.

"Could Zhang Yu truly be a genius in artifact refinement?"

"If he continues at this pace, winning a few more awards and having several patents acquired by major companies, he'll likely become an expert in the Junior College artifact refinement field within a few years."

True Monarch Magnetic Pole's gaze was filled with complex emotions as she thought to herself, "I never imagined that the student I practically paid to take on would turn out to be the most talented artifact refiner I've ever encountered."

"Excellent. In two years, I'll have Zhang Yu graduate early, recommend him for graduate studies, and help him obtain his Golden Core Certificate quickly. Then he can join my laboratory and start generating revenue for me."

After receiving True Monarch Magnetic Pole's affirmation, Zhang Yu's confidence surged.

However, True Monarch Magnetic Pole cautioned, "Your product design is excellent."

"But it's almost too good," she added. "The old judges at the Design Competition might mistakenly believe you had someone else design it for you."

"They might even think I helped you with it."

Zhang Yu's heart skipped a beat. "Teacher, what should I do?" he asked urgently.

"It's not a major problem," True Monarch Magnetic Pole replied.

"Your work will undoubtedly be selected among the top ten from all the participating schools, earning you an invitation to the live awards ceremony."

"At the ceremony, they'll inevitably test the contestants' design skills to determine the final rankings for the top ten."

"Prepare thoroughly and aim for a top-three finish."

Seeing True Monarch Magnetic Pole's response, Zhang Yu breathed a sigh of relief, feeling more confident about his chances in the Design Competition.

After submitting his design as his entry, Zhang Yu refocused his attention on refining the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword.

Time flew by, and it was early May in the blink of an eye.

Inside the laboratory, accompanied by the swirling sword light, the Level 20 Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword slashed at the secret steel before it.

With a crisp sound, the entire block of secret steel was sliced smoothly in two.

The Level 20 Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword's cutting ability was merely its most basic function. Only with the Great Sun Moral Sword Intent imbued within did it finally achieve military-grade power.

However, the Sword Intent alone wasn't enough to convince Zhang Yu to choose this military-grade magical artifact.

Only when all twelve Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords were completed, forming the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation and establishing the Great Sun Minor Spirit Realm, would the true power of this military-grade magical artifact be revealed.

For now, Zhang Yu was simply testing the Level 20 Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword's performance and the effectiveness of its Sword Intent.

Through these tests, Zhang Yu gradually gained a deeper understanding of the Sword Intent he had condensed.

"Theoretically, while morality is a human-defined concept, it's inevitably influenced by society as a whole. Living within society, people subconsciously construct their moral standards based on the prevailing societal norms."

"Although I've been influenced by Kunxu, I ultimately come from Earth and have lived there longer."

"Perhaps the future version of me will be completely changed?"

Zhang Yu wasn't sure, but at least for now, he stood with the eight billion people of Earth behind him, his mind still guided by the moral standards of his home world.

In Zhang Yu's heart... there were no truly good people in all of Kunxu, and the higher one climbed in its hierarchy, the fewer good people remained.

Through his tests, he discovered that the Great Sun Moral Sword Intent he had refined was far more potent against people than against objects.

Zhang Yu speculated, "Could it be particularly effective against Kunxu natives? The higher their status, the more the Sword Intent's power is amplified?"

Whenever this thought crossed his mind, the Four-Headed White Bull in his consciousness would roar, as if calling out to something.

Shaking his head, Zhang Yu temporarily ended his flying sword tests and turned to Zi Yunzhen and Su Yunni beside him. "Not done yet?"

With the completion of the Level 20 Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword, Zhang Yu's mastery of the design had long since reached Level 20 as well.

He now needed to refine just eleven more Level 20 Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Swords to complete the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation.

However, just as his skills were advancing rapidly, his assistant's progress couldn't keep up, and they began to slow down the project's timeline.

"Looks like I need to recruit some more experienced assistants."

Time was of the essence for Zhang Yu this year. He was willing to spend more Spirit Coins if it meant accelerating the project's progress.

Thanks to intelligence gathered from Feng Tingting and Ye Xingli, Zhang Yu had already identified several potential recruits.

Opening his friends list, Zhang Yu sent greetings to his targets and waited for their replies.

Just then, he noticed a video sent by the Junior College Student.

Zhang Yu thought, "Seriously? Didn't I say I'd stopped accepting videos?"

But seeing the urgent-sounding title, he glanced at the still-unreplied recruitment messages and decided to watch the video at double speed.

The video was recorded by Shui Haiyu from Mountain and Sea Vocational College. Zhang Yu remembered that Shui Haiyu had quit the Dual Cultivation Society because he suspected they were secretly promoting the Dual Rest ideology.

In subsequent videos, Shui Haiyu repeatedly urged his classmates to withdraw from the Dual Cultivation Society. When persuasion failed, he tried to prevent them from taking leave, pressuring them to attend work or school.

He soon discovered the society's hidden corruption: various methods of exploitation, including drugging, deception, and forced intoxication, were used to coerce members into taking leave and engaging in dual cultivation.

In one video, Shui Haiyu angrily rebuked, "Going on a dual rest with them is no different from walking to your death! You'll ruin your life!"

The argument ended bitterly, with both sides parting in anger.

The final scene showed Shui Haiyu facing a mirror, his face grim.

"I feel like they've been tracking me lately," he said, his voice heavy with dread. "My reports have been useless; they've already bribed the school authorities."

"They might abduct me next and force me into dual rest."

"I'll do my best to gather evidence. If anyone receives this evidence after I'm gone, please report it to the Righteous Gods..."

As Zhang Yu watched the video end, his eyes filled with contemplation. Just then, another message arrived.

This was precisely one of Zhang Yu's target recruits: Liu Xiangqiao, a senior student in the Artifact Refinement Department.

Liu Xiangqiao: Do you need something, Junior Brother?

Zhang Yu: I'm refining the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation. Would you be interested in joining?

Liu Xiangqiao: No thanks. I'm quite satisfied with my current work and not planning to switch jobs anytime soon.

Zhang Yu: Senior Sister, is Senior Brother Wufeng really fulfilling your potential?

Zhang Yu's current target was an assistant in the laboratory of Bei Wufeng, the second-ranked student in the Artifact Refinement Department.

As the department's foremost expert in flying sword refinement, Bei Wufeng had long since completed the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation and updated it multiple times.

Having participated in these projects, Liu Xiangqiao possessed extensive experience in this area — precisely the kind of assistant experience Zhang Yu desperately needed.

Zhang Yu: Don't you feel empty doing menial tasks in that project every day, Senior Sister?

Zhang Yu: Come work for me, and I'll pay you 1.2 times your current salary.

Zhang Yu: You'll manage all the assistants.

Zhang Yu: I guarantee you'll have an experience you could never get with Senior Brother Wufeng.

Reading Zhang Yu's message, Liu Xiangqiao felt a flicker of temptation.

After all, Bei Wufeng's laboratory had been established for several years and boasted a large team of talented individuals. Many assistants had already secured their own independent projects, shedding their assistant status. How could Liu Xiangqiao, still stuck doing menial tasks, not harbor ambitions of her own?

A move to another laboratory, with a promotion to a managerial role, was exactly what she desired.

However, Zhang Yu's qualifications were too meager. He was too young, lacked his own independent laboratory, and had limited funding.

Even if Zhang Yu truly possessed extraordinary talent and had True Monarch Magnetic Pole as his Master, potentially reaching the level of Bei Wufeng or even Yan Qianji in the future, Liu Xiangqiao was already a senior. Graduation was just a few years away, and she couldn't afford to wait.

In Liu Xiangqiao's eyes, Zhang Yu wasn't a promising boss.

On the contrary, Bei Wufeng's laboratory was poised for further expansion after his recent participation in the Ten Greats League, which had significantly boosted his reputation.

As for salary, Liu Xiangqiao didn't consider it the most crucial factor. If Yan Qianji were to recruit her today, she would gladly accept even a pay cut.

After being rejected again, Zhang Yu sighed in resignation.

Just as Zhang Yu was scrambling to recruit talent, eager to accelerate his project's progress, the judges of the Design Competition had begun organizing the contestants' design blueprints.

Given the demanding schedules of Nascent Soul True Monarchs, it was impossible for them to review every submission personally. Instead, staff members would pre-screen the blueprints before passing them on to the judges.

At that moment, True Monarch String Tone was reviewing a series of contestants' design blueprints that floated before him. As he silently examined them, a message from another judge popped up in his Bionic Eye.

True Monarch Tian Zhi: String Tone, take a look at Zhang Yu's design [smirking emoji]

"Zhang Yu?"

String Tone's gaze shifted. He opened the blueprint, scanned it, and couldn't help but shake his head in exasperation. "Magnetic Pole... is she spoiling this disciple too much? Did she personally do all the work herself?"
