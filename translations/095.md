# Chapter 95: Preparation, Dropping the Class

Upon hearing Bai Zhenzhen agree, Zhang Yu said, "I asked around, and there's still a shortage of teachers for basic high school cultivation techniques. I've been watching you train recently. Your level in those techniques shouldn't be low, right?"

More than two months ago, all of Bai Zhenzhen's basic high school cultivation techniques had already reached level 4 or 5.

And during this time, for the first time in her life, Bai Zhenzhen had gradually released the restraints on her spiritual root, using it to cultivate with wild abandon.

This brought her an unprecedented experience. As the spiritual root worked on her body twenty-four hours a day, it became more and more attuned to her, its effects growing ever greater.

Now, her basic high school cultivation techniques had almost all reached level 9 or 10.

Such astonishing progress was enough to attract the attention of countless experts, and even the companies.

So... should she tell Zhang Yu?

But then she thought about how Zhang Yu had been honest with her about something as perilous as the dark world of tutoring. As partners who had sworn to get into the Ten Greats together, wouldn't it be disloyal of her to keep hiding this?

_Zhang Pianpian already knows anyway._

_Besides, I've been trying to see if I can lend it to Yu-boy to play with recently, so he'll find out sooner or later..._

Thinking this, Bai Zhenzhen immediately leaned close to Zhang Yu and whispered into his ear, "I've basically trained all the basic cultivation techniques from the first year of high school to level 9 or 10."

Although he had long known Zhen was using a cheat, Zhang Yu was still slightly stunned when he heard these words.

He then recalled what the doll had said about the spiritual root during lunch and thought to himself, _Could this be related to the spiritual root in Zhen's stomach?_

And when the doll heard what Bai Zhenzhen said, it was also shaken. _Heavens! Where did this monster come from? Could it be that someone unlocked her potential too?_

Seeing Zhang Yu in a daze, Bai Zhenzhen first smiled smugly, then, with a desire to show off, she leaned in and whispered in his ear again, "Do you want to know how I did it?"

Zhang Yu rubbed his slightly itchy ear and said, "You can tell me whenever you want. It's fine if you don't want to, either."

_It's just a cheat, right? As if I don't have one._

Zhang Yu then continued speaking about the dark world of tutoring, "I'll go ask again tonight which high school basic courses are the most popular and which are most in need of teachers. You should prepare well these next few days, and I'll take you for a trial lesson then."

Bai Zhenzhen looked at Zhang Yu in surprise, thinking, _Isn't Yu-boy the least bit curious how I managed to raise all my basic cultivation techniques to level 9 and 10 so quickly?_

She had been planning to tell him, but seeing Zhang Yu's nonchalant expression was like a child wanting to show off a treasured toy, only to find the adult completely uninterested, instantly draining all her enthusiasm for showing off.

_Hmph, just wait until my spiritual root can be taken out for you to use. Let's see if you beg me then._

With this thought, Bai Zhenzhen held her breath and went to the side to engage in ascetic training.

For the next few days, aside from preparing for the tutoring lessons with Bai Zhenzhen, Zhang Yu spent most of his time wholeheartedly cultivating the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

On this day, Zhang Yu was cultivating with Bai Zhenzhen on the rooftop, a low hum emanating from his muscles and sinews.

He continuously tempered his muscles, internal organs, and even his bones and marrow, feeling his physical strength increase bit by bit under the nourishment of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill's medicinal power.

Zhang Yu could feel that this kind of cultivation was not just improving his physical strength; the foundation of his physical body, his natural talent... also seemed to be growing more profound under the infusion of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill.

_Although on the first layer of Kunxu, the Ten Great Sects stipulate that no one can truly begin cultivating until high school—otherwise it's illegal cultivation punishable by death._

_But those rich people aren't like the original Zhang Yu, who lived in poverty until his first year of high school._

Zhang Yu now knew that the wealthy in Songyang City began training from a young age; although they didn't truly start cultivating, they underwent modification surgeries, took medicinal supplements, used dietary supplements, and various other methods to enhance their potential and foundation before high school.

Even someone like Zhao Tianxing, whose family was far less wealthy, Zhang Yu had heard him say that his parents had been feeding him various supplements since elementary school.

It could be said that the vast majority of students at Songyang High School were not like the original Zhang Yu, who went into high school cultivation with a completely natural and untouched body.

Zhang Yu guessed inwardly, _Perhaps it's precisely this gap that led to the original's insufficient drug resistance, which is why taking the enhancers caused problems with his internal organs._

And now, after cultivating the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi during this period, especially after taking the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill for training, Zhang Yu felt that his entire body of flesh and blood, from his internal organs to his marrow and bones, was gradually beginning to possess a fundamental strength.

It was no longer just about getting stronger through attrition, like when he practiced the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms in the past.

Instead, under the scouring of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi combined with the medicinal power of the pill, he felt his internal qi and blood becoming more vigorous, his digestive ability growing stronger, his metabolism increasing, and even the hidden waste and toxins within his organs being gradually expelled.

_If I continue to strengthen my foundation like this, my body's potential will be greater, and it will be easier to increase my physical strength in the future._

_Especially with my internal organs feeling more and more comfortable... if this continues, I should be able to take more body tempering enhancers for cultivation in the future, right?_

Just then, his phone rang. Zhang Yu answered and saw it was a call from Song Hailong.

Song Hailong said, "Zhang Yu, I'm calling to inform you and Bai Zhenzhen that the future training sessions are canceled."

"Huh?" Zhang Yu said, surprised. "Are you sure?"

Song Hailong said, "Thank you for your hard work during this time. You've helped me improve a lot in ground-based combat."

"But you should have felt it too. My physical strength is improving faster and faster. You won't be able to keep up."

Zhang Yu thought to himself that he could now take Crimson Marrow Primordial Pills continuously and that his physical strength would definitely be able to keep up with Song Hailong's in the future. He was just about to persuade the other party to continue paying for lessons.

But then he heard Song Hailong continue, "You are excellent, but I've found an even more excellent combat practice partner. And my time is very limited, so I can only terminate our collaboration."

Zhang Yu asked curiously, "Who is it?"

He wanted to see who was stealing his business.

Song Hailong gritted his teeth and said, "Yu Xinghan."

Listening to Song Hailong's voice, Zhang Yu could almost picture the other's ferocious expression, veins bulging on his forehead.

Song Hailong continued, "He was first in the first-year class in the recent monthly exam."

"Heh," Song Hailong laughed sarcastically. "He needed to find a sparring partner and thought I was the most suitable in White Dragon's first year, so he hired me as his combat sparring partner for ten thousand an hour."

"I don't care about the money, but challenging this guy every day and surpassing him step by step—that really suits me."

"Alright, that's all. You should cultivate hard too. Don't let me not even see you at the sports competition..."

Hearing Song Hailong's words, Zhang Yu could only suppress his original intention to persuade him.

What else could he say?

Good grief, his own client had now become someone else's employee. Someone stronger than him was paying to fight Song Hailong; how could he possibly compete with that?

Zhang Yu could only hang up the phone silently and relay the tragic news to Bai Zhenzhen.

Bai Zhenzhen sighed upon hearing it. "Damn, our income has dropped again. It seems tutoring for the Dark Learning Gang is unavoidable now. I'll prepare a bit more, and we'll go in two days."

Bai Zhenzhen thought about how she and Zhang Yu were doing gang business, fighting for a tutoring fee of a few thousand an hour.

Meanwhile, Song Hailong could earn 10,000 an hour while challenging a strong opponent and training in combat.

Bai Zhenzhen couldn't help but lament, "Damn it, how do these rich people make money so easily?"

...

Another two days passed.

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen met at the agreed-upon subway station.

Under the circulation of his Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi, Zhang Yu had once again transformed into the image of Teacher Ma.

And as he looked at the girl before him—who, after taking off her mask, had a face, arms, and neck covered in tattoos and a head of long golden hair—he had to check his phone to confirm that it was Bai Zhenzhen.

_What the hell? How did Zhen become a rune warrior? Some kind of punk?_

Seeing Zhang Yu's surprised look, Bai Zhenzhen said with a face full of disdain, "Didn't you say we needed a disguise? You have your Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi to change your shape, so I can only use some tattoo stickers, a wig, and padding to change my appearance. I'll wash it off when I get home."

"With a mask on like this, no one should be able to recognize me, right?"

"And I don't look like a high school student now, do I? Otherwise, how would I get through the interview?"

Only then did Zhang Yu's gaze shift from the tattoos on Bai Zhenzhen's body to her chest, butt, and shoes.

He thought to himself, _So she's wearing padding? No wonder her figure looks a size bigger. Paired with the tattoos and wig, she really doesn't look like a high school student at all._

But thinking about the interview for the tutoring position today, Zhang Yu subconsciously said, "With so many tattoos, will there be a problem with the interview for a tutoring position?"

Bai Zhenzhen, however, retorted, "What kind of damn gang interview would disqualify someone for tattoos!"

"Besides, I think this style is exactly what the Dark Learning Gang is looking for. Look at the words I've stuck on; don't they show my determination to be an illegal tutor?"

Zhang Yu looked at the phrases 'The Sea of Classes is Boundless' and 'Attend Class Every Day' on her face, along with tattoos of desks, chairs, classrooms, and blackboards, and suddenly felt that this was indeed the style he had seen at the Dark Learning Gang.

The doll commented, "With my many years of experience in the underworld, her tattoos are definitely a plus for the interview. At least from the outside, she looks more like a member of the Dark Learning Gang than you do, giving off the vibe of a high school teacher who fell into massive debt and was forced to sell lessons."

"Alright then," Zhang Yu nodded, leading the re-masked Bai Zhenzhen towards the Dark Learning Gang's campus.

However, because he was with Bai Zhenzhen this time, Zhang Yu first took the subway.

After getting off the subway and thinking about the considerable distance remaining, Zhang Yu said, "There's still a long way to go. I can carry you."
