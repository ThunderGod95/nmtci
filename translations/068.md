# Chapter 68: Grouping

For this martial arts competition, each school could send a maximum of ten participants.

After arriving at the venue, Zhang Yu discovered that there were only just over forty contestants in total, thirty of whom belonged to the three great high schools.

The remaining dozen or so contestants were all from other regular and key high schools.

They might not have understood the state of the martial arts competition, perhaps they lacked channels for information, or maybe they came with a sliver of hope, wanting to see the world or try their luck.

But as the powerhouses from the three great high schools took the stage one by one to display their strength, the students from the other high schools gradually began to have second thoughts and started to withdraw from the competition.

Of course, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen did not back down.

Zhang Yu recalled the rules, knowing that the contestants would be sorted into different tiers based on their scores.

Then, after a random draw, contestants of the same tier would be assigned to eight different groups for the group stage elimination rounds.

This was to ensure as much as possible that each group contained contestants from all tiers, from high to low, and to prevent multiple high-tier contestants from being eliminated prematurely in the same group.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _If I don't want to be grouped with that batch of most formidable students, then I have to get as high a score as possible._

_Only then can I avoid facing tough opponents in the group stage and better secure a spot in the top eight._

Looking at the Yellow Turban Strongman on the stage, a battle plan gradually formed in Zhang Yu's mind.

A short while later, it was finally Zhang Yu's turn.

...

In the audience.

Zhao Tianxing, Qian Shen, and He Dayou were sitting together.

Aside from He Dayou, who had a look of utter disgust on his face, Qian Shen was watching the ring intently.

Zhao Tianxing, however, kept feeling that the students from the three great high schools not far away were looking at him, and felt a bit awkward that a Songyang student like himself was here watching the competition with them.

He also felt that the Songyang High School uniform he was wearing... seemed so rare and out of place here in the hallowed halls of White Dragon High, and he felt that the people around him had strange expressions when they saw the Songyang uniform on him.

Of course, Zhao Tianxing was actually overthinking it. To the vast majority of students from the three great schools...

Songyang High School? Do the students there even understand cultivation? What's there to see? We're here to watch the competition.

But just then, a student wearing a White Dragon High uniform walked over, looked at He Dayou, and said, "Dayou, you really came to watch my match?"

He Dayou looked at him, wondering why his sunglasses and mask were so useless.

"Yeah," He Dayou nodded and said, "I came to see what the overall level of the three great schools is like this year."

Chu Qiuhe from White Dragon High chuckled and said, "I saw that your Songyang High School actually sent people to compete. What were you thinking? Aren't you afraid of being beaten into bankruptcy?"

Although he knew there was indeed a gap between Songyang and the three great schools, as the Son of the School Director, He Dayou still felt a primal discomfort hearing this.

_To insult Songyang in front of the Son of the School Director, you've already found your path to death._

But he also understood that there was indeed a tiny bit of a gap between Songyang and White Dragon.

And even though he and Chu Qiuhe had been middle school classmates, their friendship had gradually soured after he was admitted to Songyang and the other to White Dragon High.

In front of the other boy, He Dayou always felt a sense of inferiority.

Even now, Chu Qiuhe was only looking at his middle school classmate, He Dayou, treating Qian Shen and Zhao Tianxing beside him as if they were thin air.

After all, Songyang High School... Heh.

At this moment, He Dayou said lightly, "Who knows. Anyway, that guy got fourth in the last Mana Competition, so maybe he wanted to try his luck again this time."

Hearing the title of fourth in the Mana Competition, Chu Qiuhe was momentarily choked up and gave an awkward laugh.

"Martial arts combat is different from the Mana Competition. Martial combat is about comprehensive strength; the gap between White Dragon, Purple Cloud, Red Pagoda, and the other high schools will be stretched very wide."

As he spoke, he looked toward the ring and said, "Perfect timing, someone from your school is up. Let me help you see what his level is like..."

Meanwhile, seeing that it was a student from Songyang High School who was taking the stage, many in the audience also expected a tough fight.

But then they saw Zhang Yu clash with the Yellow Turban Strongman, and with a bang... the Yellow Turban Strongman was thrown out of bounds.

Zhang Yu, 300 points.

The entire arena was suddenly in an uproar, as no one had expected that a student from Songyang High School could achieve this.

Chu Qiuhe was also stunned. Seeing the Yellow Turban Strongman thrown out by Zhang Yu before he had even finished his sentence, he asked in astonishment, "300 points? Your Songyang can produce a student like this?"

That tone... it was as if he had just seen a flower bloom on a pile of cow dung.

Although he hated Zhang Yu, He Dayou had to admit that at this moment, seeing Chu Qiuhe's astonished expression, he felt a slight sense of satisfaction. He nodded reservedly, "Our year is quite formidable."

Qian Shen, beside him, also said, "Zhang Yu does have a score of 653, after all. He's very strong."

Zhao Tianxing, seeing the uproar in the arena, subconsciously puffed out his chest, feeling that the Songyang uniform on his body didn't seem so humble anymore.

...

When Chu Qiuhe returned to Song Hailong's side, he saw the competition coach reviewing the slow-motion replay with a few others.

The coach analyzed, "This Zhang Yu positioned himself at the edge of the ring right from the start."

"This was to make the Yellow Turban Strongman take the initiative to come to the edge of the ring after it attacked."

"Then, he used an ordinary straight punch, and this is where it gets interesting."

In the footage, Zhang Yu, as if he had predicted it, intercepted the Yellow Turban Strongman's move in advance.

The competition coach continued his analysis, "In that instant, he determined the Yellow Turban Strongman's attack, then interrupted it early, and then used the Limitless Cloud Hand to redirect the Strongman's power, ultimately throwing it several steps away."

"And because of his positioning, several steps away was right outside the boundary."

"From start to finish, every move was calculated to perfection..."

After hearing this analysis, Song Hailong's initially intrigued gaze instantly faded, and he turned his head away with a bored expression.

"I thought this kid was a dark horse like he was in the Mana Competition and would have some real strength."

"Turns out he just likes to use these clever little tricks. How boring."

The competition coach didn't refute Song Hailong's words, because he was both the dominant number one student of the year and undeniably wealthy, so as long as he didn't insult the teacher, he could say whatever he wanted.

Besides, the coach also knew that this ace son truly didn't need to consider a contestant of Zhang Yu's level.

But the competition coach still looked at the other students and reminded them, "Don't underestimate him. Although there's an element of trickery, to be able to make that judgment in that instant means either his reaction time and concentration are exceptionally strong, and his understanding of martial arts is very deep..."

"Or he observed the Yellow Turban Strongman for a long time beforehand and figured out some of its attack patterns."

"Although his various stats are likely not as high as yours, this kind of opponent is very capable of defeating a stronger foe with a weaker force. If you encounter him, you must not be careless."

"Anyone who loses to an opponent from outside the three great schools today will be fined ten thousand credits and will have to kneel through class for the rest of the month."

The students immediately responded with a loud "Yes, sir."

Listening to the coach's analysis, Chu Qiuhe thought to himself, _So that's how it was._

When he first saw Zhang Yu instantly defeat the Yellow Turban Strongman, he thought the guy was a powerhouse on the same level as Song Hailong.

But now, after hearing the explanation, he felt that with some preparation, it seemed like something he could do as well.

...

On the other side, in the Purple Cloud High School preparation area.

Lian Tianji laughed. "Zhang Yu is really impressive."

Le Mulan, who was next to him, glanced over and said indifferently, "He can't even afford to rent the most basic combat spiritual root. Poor people are truly pathetic."

"But even though he's already so poor, he still insists on risking bankruptcy to participate. I really can't understand it."

Le Mulan turned her head to look at Lian Tianji, asking with a curious and uncomprehending expression, "You're so much poorer than me. Can you understand what they're thinking?"

Lian Tianji gave an awkward laugh, at a loss for words for a moment. He could only comfort himself in his heart, _The divine number one is just being blunt, she's not intentionally looking down on me. I shouldn't take it to heart._

...

And not long after Zhang Yu left the stage, it was finally Bai Zhenzhen's turn.

In the audience, Qian Shen and Zhao Tianxing were originally looking forward to Bai Zhenzhen's performance.

Who would have known that moments later, they would find Bai Zhenzhen fighting a difficult battle on the ring, desperately dodging the Yellow Turban Strongman while barely finding openings to touch the sensor patches on its body.

"Bai Zhenzhen is struggling this much?"

He Dayou watched the spirited Bai Zhenzhen who had beaten him up now being pushed into a corner by the Yellow Turban Strongman's attacks. He suddenly found that he felt no pleasure in his heart, but rather a kind of bitterness.

And this bitterness was less because of Bai Zhenzhen and more because of the version of himself who had once been beaten by her.

Qian Shen, at his side, frowned. "Bai Zhenzhen's fighting style doesn't seem well-suited for dealing with the Yellow Turban Strongman."

Zhao Tianxing said worriedly, "At this rate, isn't she going to be placed in a group with a high-scoring contestant? It's very likely she'll be eliminated in the group stage."

...

As Bai Zhenzhen's difficult fight on the ring dragged on, the audience and other contestants quickly lost interest.

Song Hailong had long since closed his eyes in boredom, seemingly feeling that watching such a fight for even another second was a waste of time.

On the other side, Lian Tianji also felt a sense of surprise.

_That girl who came to compete with Zhang Yu... it seems she was with Zhang Yu at the last Mana Competition too._

_She's clearly so weak, why does she insist on accompanying Zhang Yu to compete? Could it be... she's Zhang Yu's slave at Songyang High? Has Songyang started playing that game too?_

Lei Jun, watching this scene, said thoughtfully, "It seems Bai Zhenzhen realized her fighting style is not suited for fighting the Yellow Turban Strongman and decided to hide her strength."

As the teacher who had tutored Bai Zhenzhen for two weeks, Lei Jun knew that her true strength was far beyond what she was displaying on the stage at this moment.

Zhang Yu folded his arms across his chest, watching the figure on the ring, and gradually understood her plan as well.

Although the Yellow Turban Strongman was only outputting at a physical fortitude of 1.98, its own material composition was unchanged; it was still an indestructible object for students.

And Bai Zhenzhen's fighting style had always been to attack the enemy's weak points. Facing an opponent like the Yellow Turban Strongman that was impervious to blades and spears and required a head-on clash, it was obvious that she would easily be at a disadvantage.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, _My goal is to avoid strong opponents in the group stage as much as possible, to guarantee a spot in the top eight._

_It looks like Zhen knows she can't get a high score, so she's simply hiding her strength, planning to give her opponent a surprise when she encounters a powerhouse in the group stage?_

In the end, Bai Zhenzhen scored 89 points.
