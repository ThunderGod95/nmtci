# Chapter 491: The Value of Longevity

"Free?" Ji Yuanshu eyed the speaker warily.

Though currently experiencing unprecedented poverty, the worst financial straits of his life, Ji Yuanshu's vigilance had been honed to its sharpest edge by recent trials.

"What good could come from something free? Another scammer? They won't fool me this time."

With these thoughts racing through his mind, Ji Yuanshu retreated several steps, his expression guarded, before quickly leaving the scene.

Fu Xinyao frowned as she watched him go. "Those Civil Engineering Department students at Myriad Laws University... they're such a nuisance."

"Well, I'll just take things slow."

Fu Xinyao knew that Divine Monarch Jade Nectar had left her here not only to gather intelligence but also as a pawn planted within Myriad Laws University.

Through the Soul Transformation Yin Artifact, Divine Monarch Jade Nectar could descend at any moment and exert vast influence over the material world through the Spirit Realm.

"Myriad Laws University stole Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's Bionics. They'll never stop researching them."

"And the Divine Monarch won't give up either."

Fu Xinyao thought to herself, "This skirmish is just an appetizer. The real battle is yet to come."

Time flowed relentlessly, marked by the successive announcements from Myriad Laws University and Joyful Union University.

Compared to their immediate studies and work, even the clash between two Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs gradually faded from public attention.

Especially as late February approached and final exams began, students across University City grew increasingly hurried.

One day after class, Le Mulan darted through the Primordial Magnetic Channel at top speed, racing toward her dormitory.

She wanted to deliver a newly refined potion to Zhang Yu.

Le Mulan hadn't contacted him beforehand, not wanting to waste his time.

She knew Zhang Yu was incredibly busy these days, every minute and second of his time far more valuable than hers. Often, he would disappear for days on end.

Le Mulan had considered giving Zhang Yu something else.

But like most students at Myriad Laws University, her finances were tight, with most of her income going toward her cultivation.

The most valuable thing she could offer was the fruit of her cultivation efforts: the potions she refined herself.

"But... would Zhang Yu even appreciate the potions I'm making now?"

"To him... is this just something better than nothing?"

But Le Mulan knew that these were the best gifts she could offer Zhang Yu.

Just then, a fierce gust of wind swept through the street, and Zhang Yu's figure flashed into the air and vanished.

Le Mulan tried to catch up, but no matter how she accelerated, Zhang Yu's figure grew smaller and smaller, until he stepped into the Anti-Gravity Passage.

The Anti-Gravity Passage was a route Le Mulan wasn't authorized to use.

She watched Zhang Yu soar skyward and disappear into the passage. Lowering her head, she slowly walked back toward her dormitory.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu arrived at the Examination Field and began his final exams for the semester.

With his current strength, the final exams were effortless. He consistently finished first in every test, completing each one early and leaving the field as the top scorer.

Before long, it was time for the final Engineering exam.

Tu Lishan reminded the students, "Everyone, double-check your Bionics. Are they fully charged with Magic Power? Has your membership expired? Do you have enough Spirit Realm data credits? Every year, Myriad Laws University students run into these problems during exams. I hope our Civil Engineering Department can avoid that this year..."

As the examination began, the entire Examination Field shook with a thunderous roar.

The students turned their gazes toward Zhang Yu's position and witnessed a scene as if heaven and earth were collapsing. Construction materials scattered across the field seemed to come alive, leaping, transforming, and assembling themselves under the influence of Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power.

The towering structure required for the examination materialized before their eyes at an astonishing speed.

After completing the examination first, Zhang Yu left the field under the envious gazes of the other students.

He thought to himself, "Was that Le Mulan I saw on the way here?"

Zhang Yu sent Le Mulan a message: "Are you in the dorm?"

Zhang Yu: "Wait for me, I'm coming."

As he hurried back to the dorm, Zhang Yu mused, "Le Mulan's Profound Cold Meridian should reach Level 2 today."

With Zhang Yu's periodic infusions of Magic Power, especially after he acquired the Blazing Sun Meridian to complement Le Mulan's Profound Cold Meridian, her progress in both Magic Power and Magic Power Quality, while not as astonishing as Zhang Yu's, had already surpassed most Foundation Establishment Students of her level.

Now, with the end of the first semester of her third year, Le Mulan's Magic Power level had long since reached 1,000 units, and her Magic Power Quality was steadily approaching 200%.

After some calculations, Zhang Yu estimated that today would be the day Le Mulan's Magic Power Quality finally reached 200%.

Zhang Yu was eagerly anticipating the effects of Le Mulan's upgraded Dao Seed.

As soon as they entered their dormitory, Zhang Yu impatiently began channeling his Magic Power into Le Mulan.

As Le Mulan's Magic Power Quality reached 200%, a sudden chill rose from within her body, followed by a surge of heat that coursed through her meridians, continuously flowing back into Zhang Yu's body.

Le Mulan said in surprise, "The Magic Power within me... it seems to have changed again?"

Zhang Yu, glancing at the Dao Seed Register where the Profound Cold Meridian had already reached Level 2, nodded. "It has indeed changed."

After some testing, Zhang Yu gradually understood the effects of the Level 2 Profound Cold Meridian.

If the Level 1 Profound Cold Meridian had imbued Magic Power with a cold attribute, capable of freezing Gang Qi and vital energy, sterilizing wounds, and even unleashing cold poison within opponents, along with a slight life-extending effect,

the Level 2 Profound Cold Meridian took this cold attribute even further.

"With continuous circulation of Magic Power, the body can maintain a constant low-temperature state. Even during a full-power physical burst, the temperature can be kept below 60 degrees Celsius."

Zhang Yu knew this was an astonishing feat. During a cultivator's physical burst, the body's heat output could increase by tens or even hundreds of times its normal level.

The longer the burst lasted, the higher the internal heat became, placing an increasing strain on the body and eventually reducing the efficiency of Magic Power circulation.

"The Level 2 Profound Cold Meridian not only suppresses internal temperature but also conducts excess heat out of the body through Magic Power."

Zhang Yu thought, "So it's like lowering internal temperature while simultaneously raising external temperature."

While impressive, these capabilities weren't particularly remarkable to Zhang Yu. After all, Kunxu had no shortage of Cultivation Arts, Bionics, magical artifacts, and Daoist Arts that could achieve similar effects.

"The true value lies in its life-extending properties."

"With prolonged use of the Level 2 Profound Cold Meridian, its life-extending effects on the physical body become even more pronounced."

"If this continues, extending lifespan by 10-20% should be easily achievable."

"And lifespan... that's just another form of currency."

Just then, Feng Tingting sent a message: Zhang Yu, have you heard? The Old Director of the Civil Engineering Department is retiring! His body can no longer sustain life extension.

Feng Tingting: Director Gao will be temporarily taking over his duties.

Feng Tingting: If Director Gao performs well over the next year, he'll likely be promoted to full director.

Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Even with a Civil Engineering degree, Feng Tingting is still as gossipy as ever."

"Though... she seems to be talking less about artifact crafting gossip lately and more about Civil Engineering gossip."

Zhang Yu quickly sent a congratulatory message to Director Gao.

Reflecting on the news of the Old Director's retirement, Zhang Yu couldn't help but sigh, "Lifespan... something countless people would bankrupt themselves trying to extend."

Feeling the Profound Cold Meridian within him, he turned his gaze to Le Mulan beside him, his eyes burning with intensity. He thought, "Even if the lifespan extension effect is halved, what price would cultivators who have exhausted every other method and whose life extension costs are skyrocketing pay for it?"

"With Le Mulan around, my future lifespan will be long and prosperous, giving me more time to strive and work overtime, allowing me to advance further on the Immortal Dao."

"Besides, this is only the second level of the Profound Cold Meridian. If I continue to upgrade it, the life-extending effects will likely become even more pronounced."

Thinking this, Zhang Yu's eyes flashed with shrewdness as he looked at Le Mulan, feeling she was becoming increasingly valuable.

At the same time, he understood that her situation was becoming increasingly precarious.

"Once those old fogeys nearing the end of their lifespans discover this, they'll likely try to seize control of Le Mulan immediately."

"But such control comes with both risks and rewards."

Meanwhile, Le Mulan also sensed the life-extending effects of her Profound Cold Meridian, her heart filled with shock.

Seeing Le Mulan's dazed expression, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "The crucial question is... what does Le Mulan think? Would she be willing to sell her ability in exchange for more cultivation resources?"

With this thought, Zhang Yu gazed intently at Le Mulan until she snapped out of her trance.

Le Mulan: "Zhang Yu, my Magic Power..."

Zhang Yu nodded. "I sensed it too. Your Magic Power can extend lifespan."

Le Mulan's cheeks flushed slightly, her voice a mix of excitement and nervousness. "What should I do?"

Zhang Yu said solemnly, "I advise you to keep this a secret for now."

"Le Mulan, if you trust me, I can protect you when I have enough money in the future, allowing you to profit safely from this ability."

From Zhang Yu's perspective, Le Mulan's Profound Cold Meridian, though originating from her own Dao Seed, had been significantly enhanced through his Dao Seed Register. The two had mutually benefited each other.

If Le Mulan continued to cooperate with him, while short-term gains might be modest, the long-term prospects were far safer, and the potential would grow exponentially as the Profound Cold Meridian continued to improve.

However, he also knew that from Le Mulan's perspective... things might look very different.

Le Mulan knew nothing of his Feather Book, nor did she know about his Dao Seed Register. He couldn't possibly reveal such confidential information to her.

With a sigh, he realized that if Le Mulan insisted on immediately manifesting the power of the Profound Cold Meridian, he wouldn't be able to stop her.

Hearing Zhang Yu's words, Le Mulan's mind flashed back through the past few years: the scenes of Zhang Yu battling Wang Yin, the times he had repeatedly infused her with Magic Power, and the images of Zhao Tianxing and the others now working at his company...

Slowly, Le Mulan said, "I trust you."

"You might be the most trustworthy person I've ever met," she thought to herself.

Zhang Yu glanced at the Dao Seed on her chest, nodded, and said earnestly, "Rest assured, you'll never regret this choice."

Advancing the Profound Cold Meridian to the third level required 5,000 Magic Power and 250% Magic Power Quality.

Zhang Yu understood that this level of Magic Power Quality was only attainable by cultivators in the Golden Core Stage.
