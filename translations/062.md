# Chapter 62: Annihilation, and a Friend

Inside the abandoned building, Zhou Tianyi, after a bitter wait of over two hours, believed he had finally found an opportunity to ambush Zhang Yu.

But his lightning-fast strike was unexpectedly thwarted by a surge of astral qi erupting from Zhang Yu's back.

Having thrown the kick, Zhou Tianyi was left standing on only one leg.

The sudden rebound from the Formless Cloud-Astral Qi threw him off balance, sending him flying backward.

"What!"

_Zhang Yu has been learning the Limitless Cloud Hand for less than a month! How can he already emit astral qi from his back?_

Shock flooded Zhou Tianyi's mind as he felt the immense power contained within that surge of astral qi.

But before one shock could subside, another took its place; just as he tumbled to the ground and snapped his head up.

A figure radiating a murderous aura had already closed the distance, appearing directly before his eyes.

Before, when watching Zhang Yu train from a distance, Zhou Tianyi had only thought he looked imposing.

Now, face-to-face, he truly understood what that aura was.

It was a berserk killing intent, an endless will to fight. Watching Zhang Yu charge him like a vengeful demon under the influence of the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art, he felt an overwhelming impulse to turn and flee.

But just as Zhou Tianyi took an instinctive step back, Zhang Yu unleashed his full power.

Facing the masked man who had tried to ambush him, Zhang Yu, under the influence of his Martial Ascension Will, had entered a complete combat state.

_Fight! Fight! Fight! I will grind any and all enemies to dust!_

He unleashed his level 10 Limitless Cloud Hand with everything he had.

Zhang Yu thrust out a palm, and mana surged wildly from his dantian, oscillating seven times in a single instant before transforming into a torrent of Formless Cloud-Astral Qi that poured forth.

As the Formless Cloud-Astral Qi rushed at him, Zhou Tianyi knew this was a matter of life and death; with a roar, he stomped his foot and kicked out with all his might.

Boom!

The moment the two forces collided, Zhou Tianyi felt his mana give way; the Formless Cloud-Astral Qi struck him like a freight truck, sending him flying into a concrete wall not far behind.

The impact punched a hole straight through the wall.

Zhou Tianyi collapsed to the ground amidst a pile of shattered concrete and brick.

He tried to struggle to his feet, but a wave of excruciating pain shot through him, and he had no idea how many bones and muscles were broken as he collapsed to the ground once more.

Zhang Yu slowly approached him, still immersed in the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art and radiating a vicious aura. He stared coldly at the masked Zhou Tianyi and asked, "Who are you? Why did you attack me?"

Zhou Tianyi did not answer, instead assessing his injuries as despair washed over him.

With injuries this severe, he had no idea how much money it would take to recover; it would be a catastrophic setback to his Immortal Dao cultivation, and might even destroy his path completely.

While he was lost in his thoughts, Zhang Yu grabbed his mask and tore it away.

A flicker of astonishment crossed his face when he saw who was beneath it.

"Zhou Tianyi?"

Zhou Tianyi's mind raced, and he looked at Zhang Yu, saying, "Zhang Yu, do you know why you were admitted to Songyang High School?"

Seeing Zhang Yu was listening, Zhou Tianyi continued, "It's because your physical body is highly compatible with certain wealthy individuals, so they selected you to be cultivated at the high school."

"Just like many of the other poor students at Songyang High, physical compatibility has always been a hidden criterion, right alongside academic performance."

Zhang Yu frowned, not immediately believing Zhou Tianyi, and asked, "Then why recruit them into Songyang High School? Couldn't they be trained somewhere else?"

Zhou Tianyi sneered. "What do you think Songyang High School is? It has a dark and complex side that is far beyond your imagination."

"At Songyang High, the poor can be their dogs, or they can be a bank of spare parts. Of course, they need to be trained uniformly, to undergo the same cultivation as their masters."

Zhang Yu suddenly recalled the Heavenly Demon Parasitic Art.

_Could it be that a student at Songyang High is really practicing that cultivation technique?_

Zhang Yu stared at Zhou Tianyi. "So, you were sent by the student council?"

"Like I said, Songyang is complicated..." Zhou Tianyi shook his head, then suddenly coughed up a large mouthful of blood.

Under the influence of the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art, Zhang Yu had shown his attacker almost no mercy, striking with lethal force.

Zhou Tianyi could feel how severe his injuries were. He knew if he didn't get treatment soon, not only would his Immortal Dao cultivation suffer, but his very life would be at risk.

A flicker of desperation appeared in his eyes, and Zhou Tianyi began speaking faster. 

"Zhang Yu! An evil god awakened your potential and granted you some kind of power, didn't it?"

Zhang Yu’s gaze sharpened, but he remained silent; he could never reveal anything about himself or the evil god ritual.

Zhou Tianyi said, "You don't have to deny it. You..."

A sickly flush crossed his face, and a spasm of pain from his internal injuries left him momentarily speechless.

"Zhang Yu... we're... on the same side..."

"Take... take me to a clinic nearby."

Seeing Zhang Yu still motionless, feeling his life slipping away, Zhou Tianyi grew more frantic and finally blurted out, "I... I also serve an evil god, and that entity... is very interested in you..."

Just then, his body temperature began to rise, and pinpricks of light, like sparks, appeared on his cheeks.

A flicker of terror crossed Zhou Tianyi's eyes, and he roared, "I didn't mean to say it, I didn't really say it! Wait, I was just using him..."

As the light showed no sign of stopping, Zhou Tianyi finally couldn't help but scream, "Idiot!"

"That idiot!"

The next moment, crimson flames erupted all over his body.

Zhang Yu's brow furrowed deeply as he watched Zhou Tianyi turn to ash in the blink of an eye.

_Zhou Tianyi was working for an evil god?_

But when he thought about how the Eight Ministries of Righteous Gods demanded your money, while the evil gods only demanded your life, Zhang Yu suddenly realized that the evil gods... weren't without their advantages.

After all, Kunxu was full of poor people who had nothing but their lives to give.

_Come to think of it... maybe followers of evil gods aren't that rare in Kunxu._

Watching the ashes on the ground gradually disperse, he wondered, _Was that a backlash from some kind of ritual power?_

_Definitely feels like the work of some idiotic ritual._

Thinking back on what just happened, Zhang Yu wondered, _Have I been making too much noise lately, enough to attract the attention of an evil god? No, Zhou Tianyi knew me long before this. Could I have been targeted a long time ago?_

His heart sank, knowing this was something he couldn't discuss with anyone.

The three great academies, the student council, the evil gods... recalling the opponents he would have to face, Zhang Yu sighed to himself.

_Ultimately, I just have to get stronger._

He especially thought about his fight with Zhou Tianyi; if he hadn't been strong enough, he would have been the one defeated.

He thought back on the day's events: advancing and retreating during the illusionary landscape assessment, receiving Zhang Pianpian's open protection, and defeating Zhou Tianyi with his own martial strength...

At that moment, a realization seemed to dawn on Zhang Yu, and he suddenly broke into a smile.

Before, whenever he switched between the Desolate Ox Soul-Suppressing Mantra and the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art, he had felt a kind of mental conflict.

But now he suddenly thought, _Fight when you should fight, retreat when you should retreat. Face different situations with different mindsets. Why was I ever conflicted over such a simple truth?_

In that instant, Zhang Yu felt his Martial Ascension Will operate more harmoniously and smoothly, and switching to the Desolate Ox Soul-Suppressing Mantra became effortless, without the slightest hint of sluggishness.

_Time to keep training._

Whether it was enemies in the shadows or rivals from Songyang High and the three great academies, Zhang Yu needed to grow even stronger.

The night passed in a flash, and Zhang Yu's Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art reached level 6 (41/60).

Meanwhile, nside an office at Songyang High School.

Su Haifeng listened to the voice on the other end of the line, his own voice laced with surprise.

"He died from the backlash? Did he betray us?"

Listening to the response, Su Haifeng nodded repeatedly. "I will cooperate with you to process Zhou Tianyi's withdrawal."

"Rest assured, no one at the school should notice anything unusual."

"But what's the plan for Zhang Yu?"

"Honestly, between the school board, the student council, and the patrol teams... I think he's already attracting too much attention. Since our hidden asset Zhou has failed, it's too risky for any of our remaining people to make a move and risk exposure. Maybe we should leave Zhang Yu alone for now and look at the other candidates."

"After all, that Zhang Pianpian can only protect him for half a year at most..."

...

Songyang High School.

A calm, scholarly atmosphere still permeated the school grounds.

Zhang Yu took in the peaceful scene, watching the students focus on their textbooks and cultivation, and it felt as though the violent conflict on the training grounds yesterday had never even happened.

Even Zhou Tianyi's disappearance today went largely unnoticed by the class. They only heard that someone had processed his withdrawal, just like Liang Qin before him, causing almost no ripples. After all, students withdrawing was hardly a rare occurrence at Songyang High School.

It wasn't like someone jumping off a building, which might at least give the students something to talk about over a meal.

But Zhang Yu could still sense a few subtle differences.

For instance... no one was willing to come near him anymore.

The classmates who used to greet him, ask him questions, or seek his advice on cultivation... had all vanished.

It was as if an invisible wall now surrounded him, keeping everyone else away.

Of course, he knew why.

_Are they so afraid of being associated with the student council's trouble that they don't even dare to speak to me?_

Clatter!

Bai Zhenzhen casually set her tray down and sat opposite Zhang Yu.

Looking at Zhen, Zhang Yu sighed. At least he still had a good friend like her.

Bai Zhenzhen scarfed down her food while looking at Zhang Yu.

"Yu-boy, let me borrow the Talisman Tome for a few days."

Zhang Yu retracted his previous thought. _I don't have friends who ask to borrow something worth a hundred thousand the moment they sit down._

Clank.

Qian Shen also placed his tray on the table, sitting down beside Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu smiled. Old Qian might have a lower score than him, be a bit prejudiced, and look down on lower-scoring students, but it seemed he was a reliable friend nonetheless.

Qian Shen shoveled a few mouthfuls of food into his mouth, then suddenly asked, "Um... that Zhang Pianpian who scored a 699 yesterday, do you know her well?"

"Could you introduce me? I want to add her as a friend..."

Zhang Yu shot Qian Shen a glare.

He retracted his previous thought.

_This guy!_

_I treat you like a brother, and you're trying to make a move on my sister?_

_Doesn't he see there's no room for him on that golden thigh?_

But then Zhang Yu had another thought. He remembered that Qian Shen was also without any backing, and saw the look of pure adoration in his eyes.

Zhang Yu understood. _So he's just a superfan who wants to be on her friends list?_

Zhang Yu said, "Adding her as a friend shouldn't be a problem."

"But a spot on her friends list costs 3,000. You can just pay me."
