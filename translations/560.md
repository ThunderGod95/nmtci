# Chapter 560: Is This Really Junior College Life?

In Ye Xingli's laboratory, Zhang Yu remained despite now being eligible to rent his own independent laboratory from the Artifact Refinement Department. He preferred to stay here to save money.

Zhang Yu casually twisted open a medicine bottle and swallowed over a dozen pills in quick succession. These pills replenished his Magic Power, physical stamina, mental energy, and the various nutrients his body required, while also reducing his need for sleep.

As for cement, Zhang Yu had stopped consuming it back in his freshman year. By then, he had already mastered control over his digestive system, suppressing its excessive digestive power to prevent damage to his body. He no longer needed cement to feel full.

Just as Zhang Yu finished his meal and casually took his medicine, the aroma of roasting meat wafted from nearby.

Glancing over, Zhang Yu saw Zi Yunzhen devouring large chunks of meat.

In the past, meat had been as rare and luxurious as rice in Myriad Laws University's University City.

Although medicine could provide most of the body's essential nutrients, the vital energy and nourishment offered by Heavenly Essence Rice, Earth Qi Wheat, and various Demon Beast meats — which fortified the body's foundation — remained unmatched by any pharmaceutical alternative.

Zhang Yu still vividly remembered the satisfaction of freeloading at Ye Xingli's buffet banquet.

Watching Zi Yunzhen devour meat with gusto, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "Is this imported meat from Celestial Monsters University?"

The aroma of the meat made Zhang Yu uneasy. He couldn't help but wonder what creature it had been carved from.

Having visited numerous monsterfolk schools for projects and even competed at Celestial Monsters University, Zhang Yu knew all too well that these monsters considered even sentient monsterfolk as a source of meat.

Turning away, Zhang Yu muttered inwardly, "Those Finance Department guys really know how to stir things up."

"Imported meat... now countless students can afford to eat meat."

"Imported Living Stakes and materials... driving down costs and boosting profits for countless companies."

"With just these two points, countless people will support the Finance Department's alliance with the Celestial Monsters."

"Even if the construction workers protest, it won't matter."

Zhang Yu remembered Yu Xinghan mentioning earlier that with the massive infrastructure and restoration projects underway in University City, even lazy civil engineering workers could earn substantial income. To attract workers, construction sites had even raised wages.

However, with the introduction of Celestial Monster workers, the previously increased wages were quickly suppressed.

Although the workers protested, too many people in University City were profiting from their collaboration with Celestial Monsters. Even the top executives of civil engineering companies were earning considerable sums by cutting costs. What did the workers' objections matter?

Zhang Yu's gaze swept across the messages in the Top 50 group chat.

Nine Heavens Liu: The school allocated massive amounts of Spirit Coins for University City's construction, not to let the truly wealthy profit from it. They should be using those funds to research more advanced Immortal Dao technologies and enhance the university's overall competitiveness... Why waste Spirit Coins on workers? Just so they can afford more medicine, better food, and live a few extra years? What a waste!

Although civil engineering wages within University City had been suppressed, the number of civil engineering projects outside the city continued to grow.

Many students and teachers in the Civil Engineering Department could clearly sense that the University War was still raging, and even expanding.

Zhang Yu sighed inwardly, "The truce only applies to the Ten Greats."

"With the conflicts among the Ten Greats forcibly suppressed, the situation for Upper Colleges, Junior Colleges, Vocational Colleges, and lower levels hasn't eased at all. In fact, the clashes have intensified."

"The construction of University City marks the beginning of a golden age for Civil Engineering. Business in this field will only get better from here on out."

"This is good news for my upcoming cultivation plans."

As he pondered, Zhang Yu's gaze returned to the document floating within his Bionic Eye.

Defeat Bei Wufeng in five months! Compete in the Ten Greats League in seven months! Obtain an Immortal Sect Technique!

To achieve these goals, Zhang Yu still had much to accomplish, all of which he meticulously listed in his plan.

"Win the Design Competition in three months to obtain the Military Artifact Refining Engineering Certificate (Class B). Begin cultivating the military-grade Artifact Refinement Department technique, Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon."

Zhang Yu chose this technique over the Grand Void Divine Artifact Strategy because the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon focuses on enhancing the power of magical artifacts, making it more suitable for achieving results in the Ten Greats League.

What does the Design Competition evaluate?

"Commercial value, of course," Zhang Yu thought to himself. "Cost, practicality, market appeal... these are the keys to success in the Design Competition."

"With the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology and the combined knowledge of my Master and me, designing a winning product shouldn't be too difficult."

"Recently, my senior sister and I have been gathering information to design a product suitable for Junior College students, fulfilling the requirements of the Replication Dao Seed."

"Then... I can use that information, combined with the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology, to optimize the design and create another product — one specifically tailored for the Design Competition. That should be enough to win. Plus, a completely original design will avoid any copyright disputes with Ye Xingli."

Through True Monarch Magnetic Pole and Ye Xingli, Zhang Yu had come to understand that the Design Competition prioritized commercial value above all else. As long as the refined artifact had strong market potential, its performance and Blueprint Level were secondary considerations.

This was also why True Monarch Magnetic Pole had advised him to enter the Design Competition first.

The thought that he could rapidly modify blueprints using the power of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology filled Zhang Yu with secret gratitude for having obtained True Monarch Magnetic Pole's Dao Seed.

The Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology had saved him an immense amount of time, allowing him to quickly produce the necessary blueprints simply by gathering sufficient information.

While collecting information, Zhang Yu naturally didn't want to waste any time. He decided to simultaneously begin refining his second military-grade magical artifact.

Having already passed the Military Artifact Refining Engineering Certificate (Class A), Zhang Yu only needed departmental approval to study the blueprints for other military-grade magical artifacts.

With True Monarch Magnetic Pole as his Master and his current achievements, obtaining approval would be a mere formality.

"Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation..."

Zhang Yu gazed at the design blueprint before him. This was the second military-grade magical artifact he had chosen after careful consideration of various factors.

"Refine the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation while gathering information, complete the blueprints, and finally enter the Design Competition."

"Before challenging Bei Wufeng, I must complete the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation and cultivate the Heaven and Earth Cataclysmic Formless Heart Weapon."

"With these two military-grade powers mastered, my next goal is the Azure Water Golden Crystal Armor..."

Zhang Yu glanced at the timeline in his plan and nodded slightly, then checked his bank balance: 150 Spirit Coins.

Spirit Coins clearly had a significant impact on his cultivation speed.

However, thanks to Zhang Yu's arrangements, the Heavenly Sun Radiance God had smoothly integrated into the company team and was steadily earning Spirit Coins for him at the construction site.

Even as Zhang Yu wrote his plan, he split off a strand of consciousness to remotely control the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

After all, relying solely on Soul Cultivators was insufficient to fully control such a military-grade magical artifact.

Zhang Yu mentally calculated, "With the laboratory's 40 Spirit Coin subsidy, Director Gao and True Monarch Magnetic Pole's 30 Spirit Coin reimbursement, my sister's repayments, and the Heavenly Sun Radiance God's earnings... I should be able to spend roughly 100 to 110 Spirit Coins per month on artifact refinement."

"That should be enough."

He then subtly sensed the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo within his body.

As the Divine Spiritual Root continued to adapt to his Chain Method Diagram Set, the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo's enhancement of the University Holy Body had nearly reached 20%, while its boost to the Civil Engineering Holy Body approached 21%. The Qi Meridian Everflow received approximately a 10% increase, and the Martial Dao Holy Body gained around 23%.

Although Zhang Yu had obtained the Artifact Refinement Prodigy talent later, its enhancement from the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo had already approached 10% after half a year of continuous use.

Sensing the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo's vibrant vitality, Zhang Yu smiled faintly. He understood that this silent, gradual strengthening by the Divine Spiritual Root was a crucial trump card for his upcoming challenge in the Ten Greats League.

Just then, Su Yunni and another student from the Artifact Refinement Department entered the laboratory, looking somewhat reserved as they glanced at Zhang Yu.

After a brief interview, Zhang Yu assigned both students to Zi Yunzhen.

"Xiao Zi," Zhang Yu said to Zi Yunzhen, "familiarize them with our laboratory's rules and teach them the necessary knowledge for refining the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation."

Su Yunni's face lit up with surprise. "We're refining the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation next?"

Zi Yunzhen raised an eyebrow, wondering if Zhang Yu was rushing things too quickly.

Zhang Yu waved his hand dismissively, offering no explanation. He entrusted the task of training the new recruits to Zi Yunzhen, who wore a smug expression, before returning to his plans and then immersing himself in the Supreme Clarity Realm to study the required materials.

He intended to leverage the accelerated learning environment within the Supreme Clarity Realm to quickly review the foundational knowledge necessary for the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation.

Next, he would begin refining related magical artifacts to deepen his understanding of the knowledge, only then could he officially commence refining the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation.

This time, Zhang Yu was determined to complete the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation even faster than he had finished the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

Days turned into weeks, and before long, three months had passed.

Having completed his foundational studies within the Supreme Clarity Realm, Zhang Yu began conducting simulated artifact crafting experiments in the Great Void Illusionary Realm.

The Immortal Dao Technology embedded within the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation had been divided into thirteen magical artifacts.

Once Zhang Yu successfully raised the Blueprint Level of each of these thirteen artifacts to Level 20, he would have fully mastered the necessary techniques for refining the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation.

Unlike his previous approach with the Heavenly Sun Radiance God, which required extensive time in a physical laboratory, Zhang Yu now focused his efforts on simulated refinement of the thirteen artifacts within the Supreme Clarity Realm.

After all, Zhang Yu no longer needed to leave traces everywhere as he had when refining the Heavenly Sun Radiance God.

Under the astonished observation of Zi Yunzhen and Su Yunni, Zhang Yu refined only a few magical artifacts each day, but his progress was astonishingly rapid with each attempt.

Su Yunni thought to herself, "Is he using these artifacts to validate the Immortal Dao Technology required for the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation? But this rate of improvement... yesterday he was refining Fifth-Tier magical artifacts, and today he's already at Level 10?"

Zi Yunzhen was equally shaken. "This speed is unbelievable! Is it because his potential was fully unleashed during his competition with Jin Jun? Or has the prolonged high-pressure work simply made him increasingly adept at laboratory operations?"

If they hadn't witnessed it firsthand, they would have suspected Zhang Yu had outsourced the work.

The assistants, unaware of the reason for Zhang Yu's rapid progress, could only grit their teeth and study diligently, striving to keep up with his pace and hoping to assist him successfully with the upcoming projects.

After all, another military-grade project would be a crucial addition to their resumes.

As Zhang Yu was practicing his blueprint designs that day, he received a message from Divine Monarch Seven Emotions.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions: How's your cultivation of the Extreme Emotion Sword Dao progressing?

Zhang Yu's expression stiffened as he replied: It's going... okay.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions: Hmph.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions: You should give Zhenzhen a gift.

Divine Monarch Seven Emotions: She's currently at a critical juncture in her Sword Dao breakthrough. A thoughtful gift from you would greatly assist her.

Reading the Divine Monarch's message, Zhang Yu fell into deep thought.

Helping Zhenzhen complete her breakthrough was something he naturally wanted to do. His only dilemma was choosing the perfect gift.

Suddenly, a spiritual light flashed in Zhang Yu's mind. He recalled the silk stocking magical artifact he had originally designed for Ye Xingli.

"I remember promising A-Zhen silk stockings back in the Immortal Capital," he murmured.

A faint smile touched Zhang Yu's lips as he activated the power of the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology. Burning his dao heart, he began modifying the blueprint before him.

"I need a blueprint... for silk stockings perfectly suited for Bai Zhenzhen."

In an instant, countless fragments of knowledge and information surged through his mind like a thunderous bombardment, coalescing into a brand-new magical artifact design.

---

Heavenly Sword University.

Bai Zhenzhen, who was diligently cultivating, suddenly opened her eyes. The voice of Divine Monarch Seven Emotions echoed in her mind: "Stop wasting your time with mindless practice. The best way to break through your bottleneck is to find Zhang Yu."

Bai Zhenzhen replied, "Yu Zi needs to focus on the Ten Greats League. He has far more pressing matters than I do. I shouldn't waste his time..."

Just as she spoke, a message appeared in her Bionic Eye.

Noticing the smile playing on Bai Zhenzhen's lips, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions remarked dryly, "What's with the silly grin again?"

Bai Zhenzhen: "Nothing."

Zhang Yu: A-Zhen, here's the blueprint for the stockings I designed specifically for you. I'm giving you the copyright. Have them refined at Heavenly Sword University.

Bai Zhenzhen: No rush. I'll wait until you have time to refine a pair for me yourself.

---

While Zhang Yu's artifact refinement progress advanced by leaps and bounds, the data collection on Vocational College students lagged behind.

Ye Xingli sent a message: "Relying solely on scattered questionnaires from Vocational College students is proving inefficient and incomplete."

Zhang Yu asked, "Senior Sister, what's your plan?"

Ye Xingli replied, "I plan to conduct simulated experiences in the Spirit Realm to personally immerse myself in the lives of Vocational College students."

Ye Xingli added, "I heard you're also researching Vocational College student products. Want to join me? There's a discount for two."

Zhang Yu replied, "I'm in."

Ye Xingli: "There are many simulation scenarios available. I'll send you the list — we can each choose our own."

As Zhang Yu reviewed the simulation scenarios, he saw glimpses of Vocational College students' life stories unfolding like documentary films, except he would be the protagonist.

"Xiao Ming and Xiao Hong grew up together, went to high school together, and even got into Vocational College together — childhood sweethearts..."

Zhang Yu's eyes narrowed. "Is this a Vocational College romance story?"

"After getting into Vocational College, they both enrolled in the Emotion Cultivation Department and were paired together to study the Dual Cultivation Path, living days of boundless joy..."

Zhang Yu exclaimed in surprise, "Junior College students live such happy lives?"

"Finally, on the last day of their first academic year, Xiao Ming and Xiao Hong walked into the Examination Field together. There, they would each face multiple Dual Cultivation Examiners and witness the other's gradual defeat under the examiners' attacks, watching them shed their armor and weapons, their limbs going limp."

"Those whose dao hearts waver are suited for the Profound Affection Path pioneered by Divine Monarch Spirit Rhinoceros and will transfer to the Profound Affection Class in their second year. Those whose dao hearts remain steadfast, or even grow stronger, are suited for the Multifaceted Affection Path of Divine Monarch Jade Nectar and will transfer to the Multifaceted Affection Class in their second year..."

"Though Xiao Ming and Xiao Hong transferred to different classes, they never forgot each other..."

Watching the three years of love and romance between the two at Vocational College, Zhang Yu took a deep breath. "This... this is really what Junior College students' lives are like?"

He shook his head, feeling the script was still too advanced for him, and quickly flipped to the next page to look at other Junior College student experience programs.
