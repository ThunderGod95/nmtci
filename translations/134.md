# Chapter 134: Le and Bai Take Turns, Rapid Advancement

Le Mulan said with great interest, "What kind of alchemical enhancer are you looking for? Body tempering? Or one that boosts mana? I can take some more before I come next time."

Zhang Yu gave her a strange look and said, "What are you up to?"

Le Mulan thought to herself, _I just want to see if you can hold out and not drink my sweat._

Thinking of how he had once refused 400,000 during the martial arts competition.

Le Mulan felt that if she voiced this curiosity of hers, he would probably refuse her directly.

So she decided to secretly increase the value of the fluid, just to see if Zhang Yu would ultimately change his mind... and drink it.

The thought flashed through her mind, and Le Mulan continued, "Your service is good, so for me, it's just a small effort. I don't mind helping you out."

Zhang Yu thought for a moment and said, "I've been focusing on body tempering recently."

Le Mulan nodded. "Understood. Before I come next time, I'll inject my body with ten vials of Bone and Flesh Enhancement Serum."

"This is a body tempering enhancer that's normally only injectable in the late stages of Qi Refinement, but for someone like me with super-metabolism, it's just right. You can even use it after I metabolize it."

"The Bone and Flesh Enhancement Serum can effectively increase bone density, improve the repair efficiency of muscle fibers, and enhance the absorption of spiritual energy and nutrients."

"Each vial costs ten thousand yuan."

"Oral application is more effective than topical."

Seeing his stunned expression, Le Mulan smiled faintly, a newfound sense of anticipation for their next training session blooming in her heart.

She wanted to know if Zhang Yu would actually drink the fluid next time.

Opening the door and seeing Bai Zhenzhen already waiting outside, Le Mulan gave a nod and turned to leave.

The moment Bai Zhenzhen entered the room, her gaze fell upon the puddle on the floor.

Standing to the side, Zhang Yu watched Bai Zhenzhen begin to lick her lips and said with a roll of his eyes, "Zhen, you can't lick that!"

Bai Zhenzhen said with a regretful expression, "Isn't that a waste, Yu-boy? You can tell this stuff is high-end just by the smell. It's very valuable; one lick would be worth at least a few dozen yuan."

"You can't get arrogant just because you've made a little money and forget how to be frugal. We're still poor."

Zhang Yu advised, "You can't be willing to do anything for money."

Bai Zhenzhen said nonchalantly, "Money can buy anything, so what can't you do for money?"

Zhang Yu was somewhat speechless, because in Kunxu, you really could buy anything with money.

He could only change his approach. "Zhen, you lower your standards one step at a time. Today we're willing to lick a rich person's sweat to save a little money. Does that mean tomorrow we'll have to become a rich person's dog?"

"Remember back at the Mana Competition when you told me not to gamble? It's the same thing. One step back leads to falling back again and again."

As he spoke, Zhang Yu showed off the peculiar fragrance still emanating from the fluid on his body and said, "If you really want to try it, just rub some off the floor, or off me."

"Fine." Bai Zhenzhen nodded. "You have a point. I'll just rub some off you then."

Bai Zhenzhen ran her hand over Zhang Yu's arm, then smeared the fluid onto her own body.

Zhang Yu then pointed to a bag on the floor nearby, telling Bai Zhenzhen that it contained the enhancers he had bought from Le Mulan, which she had conveniently brought over today.

Then Zhang Yu swallowed one of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pills in a single gulp, feeling the medicinal power of 24,000 yuan dissolving into his body.

"I need to hurry and temper my body while the effects are active. Zhen, let me borrow the True Spiritual Root for a while."

"Okay."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded and pressed herself against Zhang Yu's back.

While inhaling the medicinal fragrance coming from his body, trying to rub as much of the fluid onto herself as possible, she sent the spiritual root into Zhang Yu's body.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu was immersed in the cultivation of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

First, the fluid from Le Mulan's body continuously seeped into his, helping him recover his stamina and energy while enhancing the effects of his training.

Then, the medicinal power of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Pill spread through his limbs and bones, increasing the strength of his flesh, blood, and bones with every cycle of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

Next was the operation of the Great Sun Sea of Qi, which constantly accelerated his metabolism, speeding up his absorption of the enhancers and hastening the transformation of his flesh and blood.

And after Zhang Yu used the Crippled Ox Body-Sacrifice Heart Art to further quiet his own mind and reduce mental exertion, his body's metabolism accelerated even more.

Finally, there was the True Spiritual Root, continuously drawing in and expelling spiritual energy, assisting the cultivation of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi while nourishing Zhang Yu's flesh, blood, sinews, bones, and nerves, drop by drop...

Under layer upon layer of enhancement, Zhang Yu's physical strength was being pushed to frantic new heights.

At this moment, he thought of nothing, contemplated nothing; he just cycled the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi over and over again, feeling his physical strength constantly increasing, feeling his mortal body grow stronger and stronger.

And within Purple Cloud High School.

A few students looked at the faint bruises on Le Mulan's wrist and said with faces full of envy, "Has the divine number one student gone for combat training again?"

Another student said, his face green with jealousy, "To be the divine number one's sparring partner... and to be able to leave a mark on her. I wouldn't even dare to dream of something so wonderful."

Not far away, Lian Tianji overheard their conversation, a trace of disdain on his face as he thought to himself, _A bunch of spineless fools._

_What's there not to dare to dream about?_

...

The next day.

There was no training with Le Mulan today.

Instead, in the room, Bai Zhenzhen could be seen taking out a row of syringes, channeling her mana into them, and then her hands became a series of afterimages as she injected them one by one into various parts of Zhang Yu's body.

This was precisely the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique that Bai Zhenzhen had learned from the competition team.

In order to pass the Foundation Establishment certification exam and to further increase his physical strength, Zhang Yu had finally chosen to use alchemical enhancers.

Of course, this was also because his internal organs were now much stronger, and much of the medicinal poison that had previously accumulated in his body had... already been expelled during his cultivation of the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

So Zhang Yu decided to try the enhancers, and if his body felt any discomfort, he would stop.

The enhancers he injected were purchased through a channel introduced by Le Mulan at a 20% discount, costing 10,500, but this was still cheaper than the prices from the competition team.

After all, Bai Zhenzhen had done a comparison; with the team's benefits, the cheapest enhancers were only discounted by 10%, and the more expensive ones were only discounted by 2%, far less cost-effective than Le Mulan's connection.

Speaking of which, Zhang Yu still remembered a benefit from the competition team: after winning first place in the athletics meet, he was eligible for a 20,000 yuan subsidy for purchasing a body tempering cultivation technique.

However, Zhang Yu had no plans to change his body tempering cultivation technique for the time being, so he decided to claim this subsidy later when he was ready to switch.

At this moment, each needle was inserted by Bai Zhenzhen with a different rhythm and at a different point, supplemented by mana oscillation to drive the medicinal power deep into Zhang Yu's muscles and bones.

After a full set of the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique, Zhang Yu could feel 10,500 yuan worth of medicinal fees being pushed into his flesh and blood, frantically nourishing his body.

At the same time, as his blood and qi surged, Zhang Yu also felt his body become sharper, more sensitive, and able to perceive his own physical form with greater precision.

The moment Bai Zhenzhen finished performing the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique, she hugged Zhang Yu tightly from behind, intending to send over the spiritual root.

Who knew that the instant she hugged him, Zhang Yu suddenly bent over, leaving Bai Zhenzhen with a look of utter confusion.

Because at the exact moment Bai Zhenzhen embraced him, Zhang Yu suddenly felt a peculiar sensation.

He was startled. _Is it because Zhen is wearing less today?_

Then he realized...

_No, it's me who's wearing less._

At this moment, Zhang Yu had no shirt on to make the injections easier.

And Zhang Yu could feel Bai Zhenzhen, wearing only a t-shirt, pressing herself tightly against him.

The barrier of a single thin layer of clothing did nothing to block Zhang Yu's perception of the force of Bai Zhenzhen's embrace.

Every point of pressure, every point of contact, even allowed him to perfectly construct a mental image of the contours of her body pressing against his.

The pressure from her abdomen, her stomach, her slender arms, and other places...

Especially as Zhang Yu bent over, the friction between them... stirred a distracting itch in his heart.

Zhang Yu finally realized that this was the sensitivity brought on by the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique.

_Damn it, no wonder they want you to sever your root. How can you train when you're this sensitive?_

At this moment, Zhang Yu had become a staunch supporter of Songyang High School's policy.

Of course, he himself didn't need it, because he had a firm will and extreme self-discipline to overcome the distracting thoughts in his mind.

For example, at this very moment, he was able to say with righteous conviction, "Zhen, get off as soon as you've sent the spiritual root over. You're disturbing my training."

Bai Zhenzhen sent the spiritual root into Zhang Yu's body and asked curiously, "Why are you bent over like that?"

Suddenly, she understood, and looked at Zhang Yu with contempt. 

"Look at you. I told you to get your root severed long ago, but you insisted on keeping it. If you fail to get your Foundation Establishment certificate in the future, it'll be all this damned root's fault."

Zhang Yu waved his hand and said, "It's fine. I have a supreme will. A mere distracting thought is not worth me spending money to suppress."

With that, he began to circulate the Crippled Ox Body-Sacrifice Heart Art, feeling as if he had transformed into a severely crippled ox, forging ahead valiantly through a sea of mud.

A moment later, Zhang Yu let out a long breath, feeling the medicinal power boiling throughout his body, and immediately seized the time to practice the Crimson Marrow Primordial Qi.

...

Just like that, if Le Mulan was there, he would use her fluid; on days without Le Mulan, he would have Bai Zhenzhen perform the Nine Dragons Acupuncture Technique.

Alternating between these two methods, Zhang Yu could feel his physical strength increasing by leaps and bounds every day.

And Bai Zhenzhen also gained a lot of benefits in the process, such as getting second-hand medicinal fluid and buying cheap body tempering enhancers.

Especially with the rotational use of the True Spiritual Root, every time the root re-entered her body, Bai Zhenzhen would feel a scorching heat from within.

That was the True Spiritual Root gradually beginning to develop the ability to absorb the essence of the sun and moon as it constantly adapted to Zhang Yu, allowing Bai Zhenzhen to also absorb spiritual energy from the light.

And in the small apartment they rented, unknowingly, more and more searchlights bought by Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen appeared, illuminating the entire room brightly every night, allowing the Great Sun Sea of Qi and the True Spiritual Root to absorb more spiritual energy from them.

Time flew by, and soon it was early May.

Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen also gradually realized that if they wanted to reach their goal by August, the rate of improvement for their mana and Dao hearts was still not fast enough.

So on this day, Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen came to a protected reserve 90 kilometers from the center of Songyang City, because they had arranged to meet Xiong Wenwu here to discuss the matter of a spirit vein.
