# Chapter 443: Want to Know How I Beat You?

From the mouth of the Formless Spirit General, the Golden Jade Wall spat forth Blazing Sun Rays, striking Ping Han's head in an instant.

The next moment, the Formless Spirit General's sandy body twisted like a thousand steel cables. Channeling its vast Gang Qi, it unleashed a palm strike toward Ping Han.

This strike contained not only Zhang Yu's own power but also the profound mysteries of the Nine Heavens Cloud Void Force. It released the accumulated force of twenty strikes, gathered during Zhang Yu's earlier entanglement with Ping Han, in one devastating blow.

Empowered by the Martial Dao Holy Body, the power of this series of attacks surged relentlessly. Under microscopic control, the individual forces coalesced into a single, overwhelming palm strike that erupted from the Formless Spirit General's hand and crashed down upon Ping Han.

Almost as soon as the Blazing Sun Rays dissipated, Ping Han looked up to see the overwhelming palm strike bearing down upon him.

The terrifying force of the palm compressed the atmosphere, pressing against Ping Han's face and inducing a suffocating sensation, as if the air itself had solidified under the pressure.

With a deafening roar, the Formless Spirit General's palm strike threatened to tear a hole in the very heavens!

Bang!

The Blade Qi in Ping Han's hand collided violently with the Formless Spirit General, unleashing a massive shockwave that sent mud and sand flying in all directions.

The Formless Spirit General's arm shattered instantly, disintegrating into a cloud of dust.

Ping Han was sent hurtling backward like a black lightning bolt, crashing heavily into the earth.

Amidst a cacophony of cracking sounds, he skidded across the battlefield, plowing through the ground and leaving a trail of gaping holes in his wake.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu shifted his hand seals, once again using the Minor Threefold Combination to manipulate the mud and sand, reconstructing the Formless Spirit General's shattered arm.

At the same time, three streams of Great Unity Golden Liquid Pill energy shot forth, transforming into golden armor that rapidly fused with the Formless Spirit General's body, spreading across its surface like molten gold.

In an instant, the general's front was completely plated in golden armor.

But just as Zhang Yu completed this transformation, a thunderous roar erupted from the distant earth. Ping Han, who had been sent flying moments before, burst from the ground and charged forward like a black lightning bolt.

Zhang Yu's gaze swept over Ping Han's undamaged armor. "That's some tough stuff," he thought grimly.

"Ordinary methods clearly won't crack that turtle shell of his!"

Though Zhang Yu had anticipated the capabilities of combat armor, Ping Han's true combat prowess and defensive capabilities still surprised him.

"Money really does buy power!"

Zhang Yu's bionic eye scanned Ping Han's armor relentlessly, as if analyzing its composition.

He knew this type of armor's outer plating was incredibly durable, providing exceptional resistance against extreme heat, cold, vibrations, slashing attacks, Gang Qi, and Daoist Arts.

Techniques like the Primordial Magnetic Meridian Severing Hand, which targeted the bionic body, would be utterly ineffective through such thick armor.

I need a stronger, more targeted attack! Zhang Yu thought.

The next moment, with a deafening clang, the azure sickle formed from Ping Han's Blade Qi collided violently with the Formless Spirit General's arm.

Ping Han sneered. "You think this lumbering giant can stop me?"

Gang Qi erupted from his feet as he leaped onto the Spirit General's arm, sprinting along its length toward Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu pressed his palms together and whispered, "Ping Han, you talk too much!"

Amidst a series of crackling explosions, the Formless Spirit General's surface rippled violently. Several arms, sheathed in Great Unity Golden Liquid, erupted from its body, transforming into a forest of golden spears that shot toward the charging Ping Han.

Ping Han's emerald scythe danced like a tempest, slicing through the incoming golden palms one after another. He severed the golden torrents, scattering their fragments across the battlefield.

"Too weak, utterly weak. You're pathetic, Zhang Yu."

The two combatants darted across the Formless Spirit General's limbs, head, chest, and back, their battle a whirlwind of motion.

Ping Han let out a wild laugh. "Look at this heap of scrap you're wearing! Is it even worth 100 Spirit Coins?"

"You dare fight with such paltry gear?"

The entire battlefield transformed into Zhang Yu's weapon, as countless golden palm prints rained down upon Ping Han.

Yet Ping Han laughed maniacally, shredding every incoming palm with his scythe. Like a living grinder, he tore into the Formless Spirit General with savage abandon.

Amidst the chaotic clash, Zhang Yu retreated while repairing the Formless Spirit General. "Do you think the money you made from trading crypto is truly yours?" he hissed coldly.

Ping Han sneered, "The money I earned through my own courage, wisdom, and vision — how could it not be mine?"

Zhang Yu unleashed a torrent of Gang Qi, coiling around Ping Han's Blade Qi and relentlessly disrupting his attacks.

"Even if I'm not as rich as you, I'll still defeat you!" Zhang Yu declared.

Ping Han's blade flashed repeatedly as he roared, "You think you can beat me when you're poorer?"

"You're fucking dreaming."

"The poor should submit, should lose. They could never withstand this move powered by my entire fortune."

With a thunderous shout, Ping Han's body erupted in blinding light, like a radiant star rising from the horizon.

"Human Dao Torrent — cleansing the world!"

Streams of luminous projections surged from Ping Han's back: dense charts of Jade Nectar Coin price fluctuations, transaction data, bullish news articles, and countless messages — the hopes, fears, and cries of coin traders.

In an instant, every corner of the arena's atmosphere was saturated with Jade Nectar Coin information, transforming into dazzling holographic displays that flooded the Spirit Realm. To the spectators, it appeared as an endless torrent of light, each 0.1-second interval bringing tens of thousands of new data points — as if a billion stars were illuminating the world.

Amidst the terrifying special effects of the Spirit Realm and the overwhelming force of the Human Dao Torrent, spectators' Bionic Eyes instantly struggled to maintain their processing power, causing severe lag in their vision.

Those with more advanced Bionic Eyes felt their brains overwhelmed by an unimaginable surge of information, rendering them unable to clearly perceive the battlefield.

Lower-grade Bionic Eyes, like the Extreme Tiger models, malfunctioned outright, shutting down and restarting before the eyes of their users.

"Too... too rich. I can't see anymore."

"So rich. Ping Han is truly wealthy. After transcending the Spirit Realm, I can't even look at him directly."

"This terrifying pressure... I can't bear to watch the battlefield anymore."

At the heart of the battlefield, Zhang Yu's vision went black. His brain, flooded with excessive information in an instant, entered an overloaded state.

As Zhang Yu's form sank into the Formless Spirit General, Ping Han stepped forward and declared, "It's over, Zhang Yu!"

The terrifying pressure gradually subsided, the radiant light in the sky faded, and Ping Han's financial reserves ceased their rapid depletion.

With swift strokes of his Blade Qi, he systematically sliced the Formless Spirit General's body into segments.

With a sickening thud, Ping Han's blade severed the Formless Spirit General's arms, sending them flying to the ground.

"Zhang Yu, let me teach you one last lesson!" Ping Han snarled. "In this world, the poor aren't even considered human!"

His Blade Qi flashed repeatedly, shattering the incoming palm strikes and pulverizing most of the Formless Spirit General's body.

Ping Han's voice dripped with contempt. "I underwent Ninefold Destruction and Reconstruction, clawing my way from poverty to wealth. Only then did I barely manage to forge a human form!"

"You're still miles away!"

Boom!

The Formless Spirit General shattered completely, revealing Zhang Yu within.

Simultaneously, the audience's attention snapped back to the arena. Countless text projections swirled above the arena:

Bankrupt him. Bankrupt him. Bankrupt him. Bankrupt him. Fuck him hard. Bankrupt him.

The projections coalesced into a single word: Bankrupt.

At that moment, the collective malice of the crowd solidified into a tangible force, threatening to tear Zhang Yu, the Nectar Coin short seller, into pieces.

As Ping Han raised his Blade Qi, poised to end it all, Zhang Yu calmly clasped his hands together. "Ping Han, didn't you want to know how I beat you?"

"This is the move that will defeat you!"

In the next instant, the scattered fragments of the Formless Spirit General, which Ping Han had just severed into pieces, suddenly came to life. Each fragment erupted with the intense Gang Qi contained within!

Simultaneously, within Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye, points on Ping Han's body lit up one by one!

This was the result of Zhang Yu's continuous analysis of Ping Han's armor and Bionic using the Treasure Appraisal Manual, allowing him to identify the weakness in their combined structure.

The fragments that had scattered moments before, now supported by the Minor Threefold Combination and Formless Cloud Gang, transformed into a sky full of palm strikes, converging on Ping Han from all directions!

These fragments had seized strategic positions during their fall, creating a flawless encirclement that sealed off nearly every inch of space around Ping Han.

Within each palm strike pulsed the combined force of Ping Han's twenty consecutive attacks!

Nine Heavens Cloud Void, Thousand-Handed Sacred Martial.

Under the combined assault of Zhang Yu and Ping Han's power, Ping Han was instantly overwhelmed, the force driving him into the ground in a single, earth-shattering impact!
