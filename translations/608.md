# Chapter 608: The Great Melee

Kuang Tianqing coldly observed the battlefield, watching the Corpse Demon army crash against the fortress walls like a tidal wave, only to be suppressed and erupt in massive bursts of blood.

She knew that if left unchecked, the Corpse Demons would soon be completely annihilated.

However, Kuang Tianqing had never expected to breach the fortress with this tactic alone. For her, it was merely a prelude — a diversion to mask the main force and sow chaos.

Kuang Tianqing turned to another student beside her, Mu Qiansi from Joyful Union University.

"It's your turn now," she said.

Through the Sky-Patrolling Flying Sword, Wen Wuya watched Corpse Demons pour ceaselessly from the depths of the earth. He directed the flying sword to join the battle, carving out swathes of empty space within the relentless tide of demons.

"Too many," Wen Wuya murmured, his voice tinged with awe despite his swift slaughter. "They must have combined Netherworld University's technology with Joyful Union University's breeding techniques to create such a massive Corpse Demon army."

In the next instant, violent explosions and intense Magic Power fluctuations erupted within the fortress.

Wen Wuya immediately queried the Four-School Group: "What's happening? Have they breached the defenses?"

A reply came swiftly: "Love Threads! Someone's been mind-controlled by Love Threads!"

"They're searching everywhere for dual cultivation partners!"

Beneath the misty clouds, Kuang Tianqing watched the chaos erupting within the fortress and smiled faintly.

In truth, over the past three days, she could have captured far more than just those few individuals. However, rather than mere capture, she chose to collaborate with Mu Qiansi, infusing their opponents with Love Threads during combat.

These Love Threads originated from the military-grade cultivation technique, the Great Harmony of Yin and Yang Celestial Melody. They could imperceptibly leave hidden gateways within a person's Sea of Consciousness, allowing for temporary suppression of reason and arousal of primal desires when needed.

"It seems this tactic has been highly successful," she mused.

"Their ranks lack experts in dual cultivation. No one could detect the Love Threads infused by the Great Harmony of Yin and Yang Celestial Melody."

A strategic assessment flashed through her mind as Kuang Tianqing coldly declared, "It's our turn to make our move."

"Everyone, fight for your lives!"

"After we win this battle, we'll hold a grand dual cultivation conference. Anyone from the Four-School Alliance is welcome to participate and engage in dual cultivation with whomever they choose. I will also be attending..."

In the next moment, Kuang Tianqing led countless powerhouses from the Four Heavenly Demon Schools in a full-scale assault on the fortress.

Kuang Tianqing, the top student from all four schools, charged ahead like an unstoppable drill, smashing into the prison's outer armor.

Di Lianzhong, the top student from White Bone University, opened his mouth and spat out a stream of five-colored mist that instantly corroded the prison's outer armor.

Kuang Tianqing continued her relentless advance without pausing, her three followers staying close behind like her personal guards, shielding her from any attacks from the rear and flanks.

*Boom!*

A burst of vital energy erupted as Kuang Tianqing critically wounded a student with a single strike. Her speed remained undiminished as she tore through multiple defensive towers and over a dozen layers of armor, rampaging through the prison like a colossal dragon.

"Zhang Yu..." A sinister smile crept across Kuang Tianqing's lips. "Let's see where you're hiding."

Countless surveillance feeds flooded Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye, revealing the entire prison, both inside and out, had descended into utter chaos.

Especially in the paths carved by Kuang Tianqing and her trio of allies, no enemy could withstand a single strike. They moved through the prison as if it were deserted, crisscrossing the grounds with impunity.

However, Zhang Yu also observed that Dao Qiankun and other powerful figures were converging on the intruders from multiple directions...

A moment later, Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye twitched slightly. The surveillance images began to blur, flicker, and occasionally cut out altogether, as if the signal was about to be lost.

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu sensed the Spirit Realm beginning to boil over. At least fifty different forces were vying for control of the Spirit Realm's information and the formation's network.

Various Spirit Realm Techniques were being unleashed, churning the Spirit Realm within and outside the fortress into a boiling maelstrom.

Zhang Yu had anticipated this chaos. "In such a free-for-all, no one can achieve absolute dominance in the Spirit Realm, not even with my formation's support."

Precisely for this reason, Zhang Yu had refrained from investing heavily in enhancing the formation's communication capabilities. Instead, he had channeled his energy, time, and resources into other aspects.

Just then, he felt the ground tremble as two earth-shattering Magic Power waves collided.

"Kuang Tianqing and Dao Qiankun... they've clashed."

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened. "Then my hunt begins."

With a thunderous crash, Kuang Tianqing's figure was suddenly sent flying backward, while the other three powerhouses engaged other students in combat nearby.

Kuang Tianqing watched Dao Qiankun pursue relentlessly, letting out a light laugh. "Brother Dao, are you so eager to get intimate with me?"

Dao Qiankun retorted coldly, "Spare me the theatrics. Intelligence about your Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique has already leaked. Your illusions have no effect on me."

Kuang Tianqing merely chuckled again, her figure flickering as she engaged Dao Qiankun in a mobile skirmish within the prison.

Simultaneously, a Heavenly Demon Banner rose behind her, stirring up a tempestuous storm in the Spirit Realm wherever it passed, tearing apart various special effects and projections into shreds.

Through this Heavenly Demon Banner's connection to the Spirit Realm, Kuang Tianqing maintained constant mental contact with her teammates, rapidly mapping out the prison's layout.

"Without absolute dominance of Spirit Realm Techniques," she thought to herself, "what's the point of building such a massive cage? It only makes it easier for Dao Qiankun and me to engage in this mobile battle."

Another fierce exchange erupted. Dao Qiankun roared, "Kuang Tianqing, how long do you plan to keep running?"

Kuang Tianqing chuckled softly. "Dao Qiankun, you're not my prey this time."

Dao Qiankun replied coldly, "You dare release prisoners and seize people right in front of me?"

"What if I do?" Kuang Tianqing retorted.

Dao Qiankun snorted. "Then you underestimate me far too much, and overestimate yourself even more."

As he spoke, Dao Qiankun transformed into a bolt of lightning, piercing through the sky and striking directly at Kuang Tianqing's position.

Kuang Tianqing's figure exploded with a thunderous crash, shattering into hundreds of blood shadows that scattered in all directions.

Simultaneously, her laughter echoed from every corner of the battlefield.

"Impressive lightning magic."

"Too bad it can't hurt me."

"If you want to stop me, you'll have to catch me first."

Dao Qiankun remained silent, transforming back into lightning and instantly vaporizing over two hundred blood shadows before pursuing the remaining ones.

Amidst this chaotic battle, powerhouses from various academies — Heavenly Sword, Netherworld, Immortal Soldiers, White Bone — took turns intervening. Some tried to intercept Kuang Tianqing, others attempted to aid her, while still others sought to block reinforcements or prevent interceptions. The entire battlefield had devolved into complete chaos, resembling a boiling cauldron of war.

Yet amidst the chaotic battlefield, Kuang Tianqing seemed to thrive, moving with increasing ease like a fish in water.

"Yan Xiang, block them ahead."

Yan Xiang, the top student from Netherworld University, glanced at the location Kuang Tianqing had marked, his brow furrowing slightly. "Hmph, does she want me to block Cang Shenyu's attack? If so, I'll have to use my backup physical body."

"Just how much does Kuang Tianqing know about our hidden cards?"

"Well, this livestream probably has a decent viewership. Let's give them a show."

Just as the intense clash ended on one side, Di Lianzhong from White Bone University received Kuang Tianqing's instructions on the other.

"Healing?"

Watching Kuang Tianqing detonate five fingers using Netherworld University's disintegration magic, forcing Dao Qiankun back before darting toward him like lightning, the top student from White Bone University thought to himself: "Tch, I'm still fighting Yan Qianji here."

"Does she want me to use that technique under these circumstances? Is she forcing my hand?"

"Very well, let's give the audience something to talk about."

In the next moment, as a hospital advertisement was projected onto the walls, all of Kuang Tianqing's physical injuries healed instantaneously through an incredibly rapid regenerative technique.

The more Dao Qiankun pursued her, the more he realized how adept Kuang Tianqing was at stirring up chaos and how skillfully she navigated the chaotic battlefield. The surrounding pandemonium seemed to coalesce into surging waves, propelling her relentlessly forward.

"Compared to the frontal assaults of the past two days, this guy excels at these chaotic melees," Dao Qiankun mused.

"But the place you're heading to is a dead end."

"Your misguided objective guarantees your failure."

As Kuang Tianqing stepped into the deepest part of the prison, arriving at the location where six prisoners were being held, Dao Qiankun shattered the only exit with a single palm strike and slowly advanced toward her.

"Kuang Tianqing, this is the battlefield I've prepared for you..."

A confined space, no escape routes, and reinforced walls making swift departure impossible — in Dao Qiankun's eyes, this was the perfect arena for his final showdown with Kuang Tianqing.

Here, he could launch a full-coverage, omnidirectional attack with no blind spots, leaving Kuang Tianqing no choice but to confront him head-on.

As for the prisoners detained here, they were naturally all fake dummies, bait to lure his opponent.

But Kuang Tianqing merely chuckled, gazing at Dao Qiankun. "Dao Qiankun," she said, "you underestimated me by at least two steps."

"Did you think I was only skilled in one-on-one combat?"

"Well, here's something that will crush your hopes: I'm actually far better at chaotic battles than staged duels."

After a brief exchange, Dao Qiankun watched Kuang Tianqing vanish like a phantom. His gaze sharpened, and he thought to himself, "What's going on? I haven't been using the breathing technique to absorb external spiritual energy. When exactly did she use the Heavenly Demon Illusionary Body Technique on me?"

"This woman... she's accounted for everyone, turning the entire battlefield into her personal stage."

While relentlessly attacking, trying to break open a new exit, Dao Qiankun simultaneously sent a message to the Four-School Group, informing them of Kuang Tianqing's disappearance.

"We must find her quickly."

"Where did she go?"

Before the main dungeon gate where the prisoners were held.

As Kuang Tianqing walked, she raised an eyebrow curiously. "Oh? You're not going to escape?"

Zhang Yu looked at her and said, "I finally got this opportunity. Why would I waste it by running away?"

"Opportunity..." Kuang Tianqing smiled slightly. "Immortal Scum, perhaps for you, the upcoming battle is the most important thing today. In your eyes, I'm everything to you, your entire world."

"But to me, you're just one of the countless opponents I've defeated today."

"Merely a fleeting moment on this battlefield."
