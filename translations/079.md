# Chapter 79: Song Hailong Wants Me to Be His Coach

Lei Jun’s heart was pounding. He was thrilled about his impending bonus, raise, and the prestige of his teaching achievements, but even more than that, he felt a wave of nostalgia for his past.

Once upon a time, Lei Jun had also been a spirited high school student, dreaming that one day he could defeat all his rivals with his iron fists, crush the top students and the wealthy beneath his feet, and stand at the very pinnacle of all the high schools in Songyang City.

"A single punch worth a hundred million! That is the ultimate realm pursued by generations of martial artists!"

But reality soon slapped him across the face.

His monthly exam scores left him feeling powerless to catch up.

The fierce, advanced competition in the tournaments made him feel as if he and those wealthy prodigies were not even in the same dimension—like a mayfly gazing upon the vast blue sky, the gap was one of despair.

Only then did he understand that the path of the Fist, the Sword, or of Qi… none could compare to the path of Money; the reality was that a hundred million could shatter all arts.

He came to understand a simple truth: only with money could one’s fists be strong. The larger the bank balance, the greater the power of the punch.

But today, his student had defeated numerous powerhouses with a frail body, using supreme talent and skill to compensate for physical weakness and the disparity in healthcare and wealth, completely overwhelming the prodigies from the famous schools.

He had accomplished something Lei Jun had once dreamed of, but later dared not even consider.

_Sigh, to defeat money with one's own fists... this is the realm our generation of martial artists should strive for. Even if it was just in a first-year tournament, this is something I'll remember for the rest of my life._

Meanwhile, the paramedic before him said nonchalantly, "It's nothing serious. He just lost a lot of blood and is feeling faint. A transfusion will fix him right up."

"I'll also prescribe some enhancers to restore his stamina, magic power, and energy..."

Lei Jun pulled out a few boxes of alchemical enhancers.

"No need. He can have mine. These should work, right?" He figured this might keep his insurance premiums from rising so much next time.

The paramedic curled his lip, thinking to himself that it was truly difficult to squeeze any extra money out of these three paupers.

A moment later, the referee came over, first inquiring about Zhang Yu’s condition before asking Bai Zhenzhen if she wished to fight Song Hailong for third place.

Bai Zhenzhen naturally declined; Song Hailong’s style as a muscle-bound monster and super tank was a perfect counter to her own.

And so, a moment later, the top four of the martial arts tournament were finalized: Zhang Yu, Le Mulan, Song Hailong, and Bai Zhenzhen, in descending order.

Over on the other side, Le Mulan had also recovered her mobility after receiving medical treatment.

After a brief rest, Zhang Yu joined Le Mulan and Song Hailong on the winners' podium to receive their respective champion, runner-up, and third-place medals.

However, while Zhang Yu was all smiles, Le Mulan and Song Hailong both wore gloomy expressions, looking as if they were constipated.

Cheers—and jeers—erupted from the audience.

Someone from Red Pagoda High said, their face contorted with jealousy, "This Zhang Yu's talent is absurd! If he can learn martial arts just by watching others, he should have to pay for it! Otherwise, he's just a martial arts thief!"

A student from Purple Cloud High wailed, "That Zhang Yu actually sat on our sacred number one! I wouldn't dare do that even in my wildest dreams! Damn it, this is worse than death!"

Someone from White Dragon sighed, "The winner stands, the loser kneels. I never thought Songyang High would have a prodigy worth kneeling for."

'Worth kneeling for' was the highest praise a high-scoring prodigy could receive at White Dragon High School.

In front of the podium, Lei Jun beamed as he took out his phone to record the moment.

Beside him, Bai Zhenzhen snapped a few photos before switching to video, her mind already racing with ideas on how to leverage their tournament fame for advertising deals.

As she filmed, she called out to the trio on the podium, "Come on, smile! You look awful with those long faces. Not you, Zhang Yu. Tone it down a bit; don't look so smug."

Lei Jun added from the side, "I'll treat you all to a meal after this. Go ask Qian Shen and the others if they want to come, and figure out what you'd like to eat."

...

In the Purple Cloud High School rest area.

Le Mulan walked back slowly, holding her second-place medal.

She had already changed out of the school uniform that had been stained with blood during her fight with Zhang Yu.

The complex emotions of fury, anger, and indignation that had twisted her features after the battle had vanished, and her serene expression made it seem as if nothing had happened at all.

Upon returning to the rest area, however, her brow furrowed slightly when she saw Lian Tianji kneeling on the ground.

"Get up. I'm revoking the stool punishment."

Lian Tianji looked up in surprise, his eyes filled with a hint of confusion. This was the first time he had ever seen Le Mulan go back on her word.

Le Mulan said calmly, "I've already lost. What right do I have to punish you?"

"If you were to become my stool, should I, who also lost, become your stool? Or should I go be Zhang Yu's stool?"

As she spoke, she turned her head slightly to look in Zhang Yu’s direction, her tone complex.

"Your failure this time wasn't your fault. That Zhang Yu is truly formidable."

"Although I still don't understand why he's unwilling to earn more money, he certainly made me aware of my own weaknesses."

Le Mulan was already planning a future training regimen focused on close-quarters combat.

Initially, in her post-match analysis, Le Mulan believed she had been too confident and had underestimated her opponent, thinking a single dodge would be enough to secure an easy victory. She never expected him to capitalize on such a minuscule opening.

However, upon reviewing the entire fight, she suddenly realized he had come prepared; not only had he identified her subtle weaknesses, but he also had the ingenuity and capability to exploit them.

Beyond that, she naturally also considered her aversion to Zhang Yu's blood.

_I should have some appropriate contact with the poor..._

Le Mulan couldn’t help but frown again at the thought. It created an uncontrollable, awkward feeling—a kind of mental discomfort.

_It conflicts with my heart art. Changing one's way of thinking is truly not easy._

Suddenly, she remembered she had added Zhang Yu as a friend.

_Perhaps I'll start by looking at a poor person's social media feed..._ she thought.

Lian Tianji climbed to his feet with a smile.

"This defeat will make us stronger. The next time we face Zhang Yu in a tournament, we'll definitely beat him."

"The next tournament?" Le Mulan said. "You mean the physical tournament? There's no sense of accomplishment in beating him in that."

Lian Tianji paused for a moment before nodding in agreement.

"That's true," he said with a sigh. "His physical strength is already so far behind ours. In two months, by the time of the physical tournament, the gap will probably be even wider."

"Unless he can join Songyang's tournament team and undergo their so-called special training program..."

...

In the White Dragon High School rest area.

Now awake and surrounded by his classmates, Chu Qiuhe lamented, "It was only after waking up and carefully reviewing the fight that I realized how terrifying Zhang Yu is. I'm afraid there isn't a single first-year student in all of Songyang City who can surpass him in practical combat skill."

Someone from White Dragon retorted unconvinced, "That's an exaggeration. I think Big Brother Hailong just slipped off the stage because he was sweating too much. He just needs to use some antiperspirant before the next match."

Chu Qiuhe pointed at him. "What are your scores? What's your rank? Kneel before you speak to me."

Only after the student knelt did Chu Qiuhe continue slowly, "You can't fully comprehend how terrifying Zhang Yu is unless you've actually fought him..."

Just then, Song Hailong returned, and the crowd immediately fell silent.

Song Hailong casually tossed the third-place medal into his bag without a second glance.

Song Hailong understood that while third place in the martial arts tournament was an honor for others, for him, it was a disgrace.

Just then, his phone rang. A mature male voice came from the other end.

"I saw your match. The two people who placed ahead of you are not stronger than you."

"You lost to people weaker than you. Father is very disappointed in you..."

Hearing this, Song Hailong grew flustered. "Brother, I was just careless..."

"Don't make excuses," the man on the other end said coldly. "You know how much Father despises excuses for failure."

Song Hailong took a deep breath and said softly, "I'm sorry."

The two-and-a-half-meter giant, listening to the reprimand, looked as anxious and flustered as a schoolboy.

After hanging up, Song Hailong looked toward Zhang Yu, his expression simmering with anger.

Since he had lost, he would have to find a way to redeem himself—in a way only the wealthy could.

He strode over to the Songyang High School rest area, his oppressive frame immediately casting a shadow over Zhang Yu.

As Zhang Yu and Bai Zhenzhen watched him warily, Song Hailong asked coldly, "How much?"

"What's your price to be my combat sparring partner?"

As someone with absolute wealth, the natural response to being defeated was to spend whatever it took to hire your opponent as a training partner, practicing relentlessly until you could crush them in turn!

Whoever defeated you, you paid them to learn everything they knew!

Hearing Song Hailong's words, both Bai Zhenzhen's and Zhang Yu's eyes lit up, and the boy in front of them suddenly seemed much more impressive.

Zhang Yu cleared his throat. "I'm very expensive, and very busy. I'll have to check my schedule to see if I'm available."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded eagerly beside him. "Yes, yes! I'm Zhang Yu's agent. You can discuss the financial arrangements with me! I also made the top four in the tournament, and I'm Zhang Yu's combat coach. I was the one who guided him in that final fight against Le Mulan. Do you want to hire me, too?"

After adding both Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu as contacts, Song Hailong looked at them and said, "Work out the exact price between yourselves and let me know."

"But there's one thing..."

Looking at Zhang Yu's frail physique, Song Hailong said with dissatisfaction, "You'd better find a way to increase your physical strength."

"Because I'm only going to get stronger and faster. I can't wait for you to catch up. If your stats are too low, I'll be able to crush you with pure strength, and then there'd be no point in training together."

Watching him walk away, Zhang Yu knew he was right.

Whether it was for the sparring money, the physical tournament in two months, or even for his future college prospects, he needed to work harder to raise his physical strength.

_I have to catch up to Song Hailong and Le Mulan._

A moment later, Zhao Tianxing, Qian Shen, and He Dayou came down from the stands to see Zhang Yu.

"That was so cool, Yu!" Zhao Tianxing said excitedly. "I took some pictures of you on the stage, take a look..."

Qian Shen remarked with feeling, "The tournament is on a whole other level, far beyond the standard curriculum. It's like a test from another dimension. A perfect score of 100 in combat is no longer enough to represent your achievements."

Bai Zhenzhen asked, "Old Lei is treating us to a meal soon. Are you guys coming? Any preferences?"

Zhao Tianxing replied, "What should we eat? I'm fine with anything, but something healthy like boiled chicken would be best."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded, making a note on her phone. "Okay, Zhao Tianxing is easy."

He Dayou stated flatly, "I don't eat peasant food. If the restaurant isn't expensive enough, I'm not going."

Bai Zhenzhen nodded and made another note. "He Dayou isn't coming."

Qian Shen said, "I know a good place. Drinks are on me."

Bai Zhenzhen noted, "Qian Shen's treat."

...

Inside a downtown restaurant.

As soon as Zhang Yu walked in, he announced, "Do you have king crab? We'll take ten."

Following behind him, Lei Jun's face darkened. _Is he trying to eat me into bankruptcy?_

Qian Shen interjected, "This place doesn't have seafood. Besides, it's not very nutritious and isn't suitable for high school students."

"This place specializes in authentic pre-packaged meals. There are no extra seasonings, so you get to taste the food in its purest form."

"The meals are also incredibly nutritious. Each dish contains over ten thousand clean calories. I often eat here after working out."

Lei Jun nodded to himself. Qian Shen was a considerate kid, mindful of his teacher's budget.

Qian Shen turned to the waiter. "Do you have any pre-packaged meals with demonic beast meat? We're all top students from Songyang High School here today. Do you have any dietary supplements on the menu?"

Lei Jun sighed. So much for Qian Shen being considerate. He wasn't a Daoist art instructor; didn't the boy know how limited a martial arts teacher's salary was?

Not wanting to let the students order recklessly, Lei Jun said directly, "I only brought 6,000. If we go over, we're all washing dishes."

A moment later, the group was seated together, raising their glasses of beast protein milk.

"Cheers!"

They were health-conscious high school students and a teacher, after all. Of course they would drink healthy and nutritious beast protein milk.

Besides, school would be starting soon after their meal, so it wouldn't be wise to drink anything that might affect their performance in class.
