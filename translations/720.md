# Chapter 720: Burning Legacy

His conversation with Fu Xiantian left Zhang Yu with an unprecedented sense of urgency.

Fu Xiantian's words made it clear that he wasn't just threatening the lives of Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs like Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole and Divine Monarch Greenwood, but also endangering all of Zhang Yu's companions and everyone he knew.

This threat was so profound that even joining the Righteous Qi Alliance couldn't resolve it.

"A feud to the death..."

Zhang Yu recalled Fu Xiantian's words, sensing the man's unwavering resolve — a determination to never retreat, even if it meant dying a hundred times.

Zhang Yu sighed inwardly. "This is truly a feud to the death. Fu Xiantian won't stop until he's killed everyone."

Lady Fortune asked curiously, "What did you two talk about? Why did Fu Xiantian just leave like that?"

Zhang Yu's gaze flickered. He realized his earlier intuition had been correct: Fu Xiantian's final words had been directly imprinted into his mind, beyond the reach of any other living being, camera, or Bionic Eye.

He then recounted his entire conversation with Fu Xiantian to Lady Fortune.

After listening, Lady Fortune exclaimed in shock, "Damn it... He really is a madman."

"If he means what he says, does that mean he plans to slaughter everyone — the Righteous Qi Alliance, the Evil Gods, the Demonic Sect, and even the Soul Transformation Cultivators from the Finance Department?"

Zhang Yu nodded. "Lady Fortune, do you think we can leak this information to the Righteous Qi Alliance?"

"You want to incite infighting among them?" Lady Fortune shook her head. "Without concrete evidence, just empty words, it'll be hard to convince the Evil Gods and those Finance Department swindlers."

"Even a seed of doubt, anything to slow him down, would be worth it, right?" Zhang Yu countered.

After entrusting the matter to Lady Fortune, Zhang Yu glanced at the estimated completion time for his plan: 6 days, 1 hour, 3 minutes, and 11 seconds.

The situation on the Soul Transformation Battlefield was critical. Fu Xiantian, sharpening his blade, vowed to slaughter all living beings. Yet within the Ten Great Universities, internal strife and power struggles continued unabated. The Heaven-Piercing Plan, repeatedly delayed by the Righteous Qi Alliance's relentless suppression, remained stalled.

But his conversation with Fu Xiantian had steeled Zhang Yu's resolve.

His gaze swept across his contacts list, settling on Tian Shengong of Immortal Armaments University.

Zhang Yu: Is True Monarch Artifact Reliance in the laboratory?

Tian Shengong started slightly, realizing the message was from True Monarch Blazing Light. He immediately tensed, wondering why Zhang Yu was contacting the True Monarch through him.

Logically, True Monarchs of their caliber should have formal channels for communication.

Nevertheless, Tian Shengong replied respectfully: True Monarch Artifact Reliance is in the laboratory.

Zhang Yu: Please tell him I have a method to unlock the Divine Monarch's Legacy. Is he interested?

In the next moment, Tian Shengong sprinted to the other side of the laboratory, his eyes fixed on True Monarch Artifact Reliance with fervent excitement.

True Monarch Artifact Reliance frowned. "Tian Shengong, you're a Golden Core True Person now. Why are you still acting so flustered? If you damage any of the equipment in here, can you afford to replace it?"

Tian Shengong's dao heart trembled as he urgently sent a message to True Monarch Artifact Reliance: True Monarch Blazing Light says he can help unlock the Soul Transformation Legacy.

True Monarch Artifact Reliance's gaze sharpened instantly, recalling his Master, who had fallen on the Soul Transformation Battlefield.

The Divine Monarch's demise had dealt a devastating blow to the morale of Immortal Armaments University.

Worse still, before severing contact, the Divine Monarch had completely sealed off all his assets, leaving them impenetrable.

Every time True Monarch Artifact Reliance and the others saw these frozen assets lying idle, their hearts ached with regret, deepening their sorrow over the Divine Monarch's loss.

"Blazing Light can unlock the Soul Transformation Legacy?"

True Monarch Artifact Reliance's first reaction was disbelief.

But when he remembered that Zhang Yu had already achieved the Soul Transformation stage, his thoughts shifted again.

"True Monarch Blazing Light is so wealthy, he wouldn't dare fabricate such an outrageous lie."

"Besides..."

True Monarch Artifact Reliance recalled Zhang Yu's Heaven-Piercing Plan and his various applications of spatial technology.

"Could he be planning to use spatial technology to unlock the Soul Transformation Legacy?"

"It seems..."

Realizing that his own Soul Transformation research into spatial technology still lagged behind Zhang Yu's, True Monarch Artifact Reliance's Magic Power surged violently within him.

*Bang!*

Tian Shengong felt a tremendous force sweep him up, and in an instant, he was hurtling out of the laboratory at breakneck speed.

"Teacher! Slow down, slow down! We're going to crash into the equipment!" Tian Shengong cried out in alarm.

True Monarch Artifact Reliance snorted coldly. "Those are just trifles. Ignore them."

Moments later, True Monarch Artifact Reliance had gathered several of the wealthiest Nascent Soul True Monarchs from Immortal Armaments University and met Zhang Yu in the Spirit Realm.

Zhang Yu cut straight to the point. "The situation is urgent. Let's not waste time."

"My final offer: I want fifty percent of the Divine Monarch's Legacy after it's unlocked."

The Nascent Soul True Monarchs from Immortal Armaments University erupted in fury. "Fifty percent? You might as well rob us at gunpoint!"

After much haggling, the final agreement settled at 34.5%.

This was roughly Zhang Yu's target price before negotiations began. He knew he could push for a slightly larger share, but the current situation didn't allow him to waste time on further bargaining.

An hour later, surrounded by Nascent Soul True Monarchs from Myriad Laws University and Immortal Armaments University, Zhang Yu clasped his hands together. A flash of light erupted before them, as if the world had momentarily darkened.

Simultaneously, Zhang Yu, wielding Kunlun in the Palm and the Immortal Descendant's power, absorbed the radiant energy within a thousand-meter radius. He then pressed his palm toward the Soul Transformation Legacy.

Within his palm, the Immortal Descendant's portal devoured everything it touched with relentless force, consuming the restrictions, defenses, and armor left by the Soul Transformation Divine Monarch.

In the next instant, a massive hole had been torn through the sealed Soul Transformation Legacy.

Sensing the dense spiritual energy pouring forth, the Nascent Soul True Monarchs present flushed with excitement.

Zhang Yu said calmly, "This one's breached. Leave a few to inventory the contents. Let's move on to the next one."

And so, one by one, the legacies left by the Soul Transformation Divine Monarch were breached by Zhang Yu.

Just as a giant beast's corpse in nature is devoured and decomposed by hyenas, vultures, ants, and bacteria, eventually reintegrating into the natural world, the legacy of the Soul Transformation Divine Monarch would also be reintegrated into the universities.

In a mere hour, a vast fortune was devoured and decomposed by numerous Nascent Souls, then injected into the production and economic chains of Immortal Armaments University and Myriad Laws University, accelerating the development of both institutions.

Meanwhile, the Spirit Realm news began broadcasting the event:

"True Monarch Blazing Light's Myriad Hands Unearth Soul Transformation Legacy!"

"Ever since the fall of their Soul Transformation Divine Monarch, the faculty and students of Immortal Armaments University have been in low spirits. Though the Divine Monarch's disciples possessed a will, they were unable to unlock the Soul Transformation Legacy, preventing the Divine Monarch's will from illuminating the world once more..."

In the video, True Monarch Artifact Reliance sighed, "Here, I must once again thank True Monarch Blazing Light for allowing us to successfully inherit our sect's legacy. I believe our Master, knowing her legacy will be properly utilized rather than gathering dust in storage, would find comfort in the afterlife..."

As the news spread, the high-ranking officials of the Ten Great Universities grew increasingly excited.

At Heavenly Demon University, True Monarch Precise Attainment declared, "We must summon True Monarch Blazing Light immediately. If our Divine Monarchs knew that their unworthy descendants couldn't even inherit their legacies after death, they'd die of anger all over again!"

The remaining Nascent Soul True Monarchs at Celestial Monsters University also sent invitations to Zhang Yu.

A cultivator with a dragon head and human body projected himself before Zhang Yu, exclaiming excitedly, "Divine Monarch Great Devourer acted against the Dao, her sins are countless, her crimes are heinous! Yet uncovering her illicit assets has proven an insurmountable challenge."

"Until Divine Monarch Great Devourer is brought to justice and her ill-gotten gains are purged, the entire Celestial Monsters University will never find peace."

The Nascent Soul True Monarchs at Vajra University watched this scene and sighed inwardly, gazing at the still-bright divine light in the sky. "How is she still alive?" they wondered.

Another True Monarch murmured, "If she's still alive... can't we break through?"

The others glared at him, but a fire had ignited in their hearts, one they couldn't extinguish.

As Zhang Yu cracked open one Soul Transformation Legacy after another, the morale of the universities whose Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs had fallen surged dramatically, boosting their work efficiency.

Zhang Yu glanced at the estimated completion time for the plan, which had now changed to 3 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 12 seconds.

At that moment, another divine light fell from the sky, reducing the number of Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs from the Ten Great Universities to just 35.

Whether it was due to numbness from the continuous reports of Divine Monarchs falling or the excitement of deciphering their legacies, Zhang Yu noticed that the impact of this latest change in the plan's timeline — now 3 days, 18 hours, 15 minutes, and 39 seconds — was significantly less than before.

"Still not enough..."

Zhang Yu gazed at the two remaining divine lights in the sky, observing that Divine Monarch Magnetic Pole's radiance had dimmed to 65% and Divine Monarch Greenwood's to 52%. He thought to himself, "I need to accelerate this further."

Having unlocked the legacies of multiple Soul Transformation Divine Monarchs and seeing his assets skyrocket once again, Zhang Yu began issuing a series of messages.

Backed by vast financial resources, each of these messages carried enough weight to create massive waves across Kunxu, altering the future and shaping history.

"Does revolution always demand sacrifice?"

Zhang Yu lifted his head, staring at the divine light in the sky that symbolized Fu Xiantian. He murmured, "Then let the sacrifices be made."

Yu Xinghan's avatar flickered wildly in Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

As the communication link connected, Yu Xinghan's face paled, his expression one of shock as he stared at Zhang Yu. "Are you insane?! You can't just throw money around like that..."

Zhang Yu replied, "I'm not insane."

"I need to accelerate the Heaven-Piercing Plan. I want everyone in the company and factories to move faster, to join me in shattering this firmament."

"From now on, I'll pay the Vocational College staff the university can't afford. I'll hire the monsterfolk other companies won't employ."

"I'll offer the discounts you can't. I'll pay the bonuses you won't. I'll raise the wages you're too afraid to!"

Yu Xinghan's face grew paler with each word, his voice trembling as he asked, "How much money are you planning to burn through?"

Zhang Yu declared firmly, "I'm a quasi-Soul Transformation cultivator. I am already rich enough to rival a university. If even I can't burn enough money to pierce this firmament, then who can possibly save us from defeat?"

As Zhang Yu poured massive funds into the effort, the companies and factories under his management roared to life like an engine pushed beyond its limits, accelerating wildly and driving the Heaven-Piercing Plan toward its climax.

Three days... two days... one day!
