# Chapter 476: Exchange and Competition

"Just hold me?"

Hearing Bai Zhenzhen's words, Zhang Yu was taken aback. "What does A-Zhen mean by that?"

He remembered their meeting at Myriad Laws University last year, when she had immediately embraced him, eager to transfer her Divine Spiritual Root.

What had changed?

Zhang Yu wondered, "Is someone still watching us?"

Just then, Lady Fortune spoke through his mind: "A-Zhen wants me to tell you that Heavenly Sword University's Spirit Realm surveillance is highly advanced. We can't rush the transfer of the Divine Spiritual Root."

"At this very moment, Divine Monarch Seven Emotions might still be observing you! And Wen Wuya, who just left, might still be tracking us!"

Zhang Yu understood. As fellow devotees of Lady Fortune, he and Bai Zhenzhen could communicate telepathically within a certain range.

Clearly, Bai Zhenzhen was using this method to relay her message.

Hearing Lady Fortune's words — that Divine Monarch Seven Emotions might be watching — Zhang Yu immediately panicked. Even his Divine Spiritual Root, which had been stirring restlessly, retreated into his Dantian.

Zhang Yu deeply understood that neither the transfer of his Divine Spiritual Root nor the fact that he possessed one himself could ever be revealed to outsiders.

Bai Zhenzhen nodded at Zhang Yu and said, "Since you rarely visit Heavenly Sword University, let me show you around!"

Zhang Yu allowed Bai Zhenzhen to take his hand and lead him out.

They walked through the tunnel, emerged from the mountain, and arrived at the Flying Sword landing platform on the summit. Back-to-back, they gazed down at the Heavenly Sword University Underground Factory's warehouse below. Zhang Yu suddenly lifted Bai Zhenzhen into his arms and carried her into a dark alley beside the Second-Hand Flying Sword Market. They pressed tightly against each other...

After repeatedly changing locations and trying various intimate poses, Bai Zhenzhen repeatedly stopped Zhang Yu from taking things further.

Bai Zhenzhen frowned, a hint of helplessness in her eyes.

Lady Fortune said, "She says it's still not safe. Divine Monarch Seven Emotions might be watching us."

"Wen Wuya probably hasn't given up tracking us either. Heavenly Sword University's surveillance is too tight — we can't hide!"

"It seems that beyond Divine Monarch Seven Emotions and Wen Wuya, many others at Heavenly Sword University are watching you and me!"

Zhang Yu sighed inwardly, touching his Dantian. "Is it impossible?" he wondered.

"Heavenly Sword University... it appears to have even more immortal aura than Myriad Laws University, but its surveillance is just as tight, if not tighter!"

And the attention on Bai Zhenzhen and me seems particularly intense!

At that moment, Bai Zhenzhen and Zhang Yu felt like two small insects on a chessboard, under the relentless glare of spotlights, unable to stir even the slightest ripple no matter how hard they struggled.

The Divine Spiritual Root, which had previously moved freely between them, now seemed bound by countless invisible chains, with no possibility of transfer.

Bai Zhenzhen smiled and turned to Zhang Yu. "Yu Zi, you should be heading to your match soon, right?"

"This time was too rushed. Next time I visit Myriad Laws, let's explore properly and have some fun together!"

Zhang Yu met Bai Zhenzhen's gaze, sensing her unspoken intentions. He nodded firmly. "Yeah!"

At that moment, Zhang Yu felt his Divine Spiritual Root within his Dantian tremble slightly once more.

In truth, as he walked alongside Bai Zhenzhen earlier, Zhang Yu had sensed his Azure Lotus Sword Embryo's Divine Spiritual Root growing increasingly restless, as if yearning to surge into her body.

Simultaneously, Bai Zhenzhen also felt a similar agitation within her own Divine Spiritual Root.

The constantly vibrating root seemed ready to burst forth with a mere thought, eager to dart toward Zhang Yu's body.

Bai Zhenzhen thought to herself, "You little rascal, why are you in such a hurry to jump into Zhang Yu's body?"

Both of them struggled to suppress the restlessness of their Divine Spiritual Roots.

Suddenly, Zhang Yu's gaze shifted. "A-Zhen, will you come watch my match later?"

Bai Zhenzhen nodded. "Of course! I wouldn't miss it for the world!"

Lady Fortune relayed Zhang Yu's message to Bai Zhenzhen: "Zhang Yu asked me to tell you to find him immediately after the match. He might have a solution."

---

Outside the Civil Engineering Competition venue, Shi Huaiyu sent a message urging Zhang Yu to hurry.

"I'm worried about Zhang Yu," she said. "The competition is about to start, and he's still not here."

Su Yanyang waved dismissively. "He's a sensible person. He'll be fine."

"Wen Wuya is right here at Heavenly Sword University. What could possibly go wrong?" he thought to himself.

Just then, Xiao Yunji's eyes flickered. "He's here!"

A thunderous boom erupted!

White shockwaves burst across the distant sky!

Propelled by the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, Zhang Yu appeared above the crowd in an instant, then floated gently down.

Across from Myriad Laws University, Yue Guanqiong, also awaiting the competition's start, tilted his head to watch Zhang Yu's descent. "His Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power is indeed more profound than before," he mused.

"It seems Wen Wuya's information was accurate. This guy gained a boost in cultivation during the Yin Artifact experiment!"

"Still... apart from the Bionic Eye, the rest of his Bionics remain purely physical."

Yue Guanwo's sword qi pulsed within him, his face betraying no hint of tension.

After all, while Zhang Yu's cultivation had improved, he still hadn't pushed his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to Level 20. Moreover, his Bionic was a tier below Yue Guanqiong's, putting him at a disadvantage akin to starting a game with fewer equipment slots.

In contrast, Yue Guanqiong was not only fully prepared but also wielded a military-grade Flying Sword backed by Wen Wuya.

"Against Zhang Yu alone, victory is assured!"

"The biggest threat in this battle is whether Mo Shangjin will buy back in!"

With this thought, Yue Guanqiong turned to the Myriad Laws University team and asked, "Where's Mo Shangjin? Is he still not participating in this match?"

Zhang Yu turned to Yue Guanqiong and smiled. "Senior Brother, are you well acquainted with Senior Brother Mo?"

Yue Guanqiong sneered, recalling his defeat the previous year, the shattering of his Flying Sword, and the humiliation of his Sword Spirit. A hint of resentment crept into his tone.

"Acquainted? Mo Shangjin and I are far too familiar!" Yue Guanqiong ground out through clenched teeth. "I've been eagerly awaiting a rematch. Aren't you coming?"

Faced with Yue Guanqiong's probing, Zhang Yu remained noncommittal. "Who knows? None of us know Senior Brother Mo's condition. Perhaps his injuries have healed, and he could enter the match at any moment!"

Yue Guanqiong scoffed inwardly, thinking, "They're deliberately bringing up Mo Shangjin to make me think he might be a substitute!"

"Do they believe I'll hold back in the competition, afraid to use my Golden Force in case Mo Shangjin appears?"

"Even without using my full power, I'll crush them all!"

Meanwhile, Zhang Yu asked in the Contest Group, "Senior Brother Mo, this guy seems to have a real problem with you?"

Mo Shangjin replied, "Everyone knows Heavenly Sword University students are very protective of their Flying Swords!"

"And Yue Guanqiong is especially petty!"

"Last year, during a spar, I accidentally nicked his Flying Sword!"

"I apologized, but he wouldn't let it go. He kept sending me private messages to curse me out!"

Li Zhen, who had been Shangjin's teammate for several years, thought to himself, "You didn't just 'accidentally' damage it!"

The competition officially began. Both teams entered the arena and took their positions at their respective construction sites.

As the countdown ended, Magic Power surged, Gang Qi soared, and everyone on the field activated their cultivation techniques, launching into action!

Rolling clouds of mud and sand erupted into the sky. Under the coordinated efforts of Shi Huaiyu, Su Yanyang, and others, the earth undulated and reshaped itself, rapidly transforming into the framework of a magical formation!

At that moment, from the direction of Heavenly Sword University's formation, sword qi soared into the sky, causing large chunks of rock to float upward, as if forming miniature floating islands that surged into the arena's airspace.

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened as he recognized the signature technique of Heavenly Sword University's Civil Engineering Department.

Unlike the Civil Engineering Departments of many other universities, Heavenly Sword University's department had been established solely to serve the university itself.

The very campus they stood upon, the entirety of Heavenly Sword University perched atop the clouds, owed its existence to the department's efforts.

Creating floating islands and aerial structures had always been the department's specialty.

As everyone launched their attacks simultaneously, Zhang Yu naturally took the lead.

Propelled by his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power, he streaked across the sky like a rainbow piercing the sun, leaving a trail of sonic booms in his wake. Accelerating relentlessly, he hurtled toward Heavenly Sword University's formation. Within a single breath, he was confident he could bring their construction site within his attack range and unleash the full force of his Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to wreak havoc.

But in the next instant, bolts of lightning flashed across the sky.

Amidst a series of explosive cracks, Zhang Yu felt faint shadows brush past him, shooting toward his rear.

"What's this...?"

Zhang Yu watched his falling hair, a flicker of realization in his mind as the attack record of the Thunder-Suppressing Seal appeared in his Bionic Eye.

The Thunder-Suppressing Seal was a magical artifact Zhang Yu had recently refined, specifically designed to counter Flying Swords.

It had just activated, diverting the incoming Flying Sword with a bolt of lightning.

Simultaneously, Grandfather Yingxin, who was remotely controlling the Thunder-Suppressing Seal, sent a message: "Just nails, but they're too small and fast to be seen with the naked eye!"

Ying Xin's Grandfather: "It's the Great Freedom Instant Hell sword qi from Heavenly Sword University."

Ying Xin's Grandfather: "Be careful, another one's coming."

Meanwhile, Yue Guanqiong sensed Zhang Yu's high-speed approach. His Gang Qi swept across the row of steel bars before him, instantly reducing them to a pile of metallic fragments.

Yue Guanqiong thought calmly, "Just as Wen Wuya instructed, I'll gradually increase the pressure, forcing out all your hidden reserves."

"Then, at the end, I'll suppress you in one fell swoop. Even if Mo Shangjin tries to buy you time, it'll be too late!"

As sword qi surged, the fragments of steel bars transformed into a metallic storm, each piece carrying a razor-sharp aura. Like tens of thousands of meteorites plummeting to earth, they hurtled toward Zhang Yu.
