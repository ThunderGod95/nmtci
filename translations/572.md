# Chapter 572: Top 20 Here — Who Dares Detain Me?

Zhang Yu sensed that something was off. Before he could ascertain the situation, he decided to avoid saying anything further.

Noticing Zhang Yu's increasing reluctance to cooperate and his evasive answers, True Person Rising Sun cleared his throat.

"Student Yu," he said, "the Dual Rest Cult members are unscrupulous and habitual liars. They'll do anything for Dual Rest. Don't believe a word Shui Haiyu says."

Zhang Yu pointed to the Overall Department Ranking above his head. "Sirs," he said calmly, "I've just finished the competition and need quiet. I'm ranked 44th overall. If you truly wish to interrogate me, please obtain approval from your superiors first. I'll gladly cooperate with your investigation then."

Yun Yuqing scoffed. "Zhang Yu, investigating the Demonic Sect is a matter of utmost importance to the Heavenly Court. Every member of Myriad Laws University — teachers and students alike — must cooperate fully."

"Having a proper conversation with you now is giving you a chance. Once we take you in for interrogation, things will be out of your hands," Yun Yuqing said coldly.

Zhang Yu replied calmly, "I need to rest now." He gestured toward the door with his right hand. "Please leave."

Seeing Zhang Yu remain unmoved, Yun Yuqing sent a message to True Person Rising Sun: Captain, what should we do? We can't intimidate him.

True Person Rising Sun replied: Zhang Yu is too calm.

Yun Yuqing: What do you mean?

True Person Rising Sun: Look at all the suspects we've dealt with. Has anyone ever been as calm as him?

True Person Rising Sun: I sense no hatred, fear, or anger toward the Dual Rest Cult from him.

True Person Rising Sun: When he speaks of the Dual Rest Cult, it's as if they're just another ordinary organization.

Yun Yuqing paused, recalling Zhang Yu's earlier demeanor. To her surprise, she realized it was true.

True Person Rising Sun: Moreover, he's being evasive about Shui Haiyu's situation. He definitely knows something.

Yun Yuqing: So what? He's in the top 50 of the entire school and a disciple of True Monarch Magnetic Pole. Even though the Artifact Refinement Department doesn't fall under our jurisdiction, we can't touch him without approval from higher-ups.

True Person Rising Sun: There's definitely something wrong with Zhang Yu.

Yun Yuqing: What makes you say that?

True Person Rising Sun: Intuition. The intuition I've honed from capturing over a hundred Demonic Sect members.

True Person Rising Sun: Something's definitely up with Zhang Yu.

Zhang Yu urged again, "Are you two leaving or not?"

True Person Rising Sun smiled faintly. "I know students in the Artifact Refinement Department are always busy — either studying materials or preparing for experiments. Student Yu, with your excellent grades, your time must be very precious, right?"

Zhang Yu frowned. "What are you getting at?"

True Person Rising Sun continued, "Shui Haiyu triggered a major strike at Mountain and Sea Vocational University that lasted an hour."

Fixing his gaze on the surprise in Zhang Yu's eyes, True Person Rising Sun added, "This news has been temporarily suppressed, and few people know about it yet."

"Shui Haiyu has already fled. After investigating him, we discovered numerous emails he sent to you."

True Person Rising Sun advised, "Student Yu, if you allow us to examine your Bionic Eye to confirm that its data hasn't been corrupted by the Dual Rest Cult, proving your innocence would be beneficial for you as well."

"If people suspect you have improper ties to the Dual Rest Cult and send you to the Restraint and Rest Institute for a few months, that would be quite troublesome for you, wouldn't it?"

Zhang Yu's gaze sharpened. "Are you threatening me?"

True Person Rising Sun chuckled. "Student Yu, don't be so defensive. We're doing this for the safety of the university and for your own good."

Before understanding their true intentions, Zhang Yu naturally wouldn't hand over his Bionic Eye for inspection. Who knew what they wanted or if they might tamper with it?

Zhang Yu simply pointed to the ranking above his head and said calmly, "See my ranking? Any issues must be reported to your superiors first, then communicated to the director of the Myriad Laws Artifact Refinement Department, according to regulations."

As he spoke, the number 44 above Zhang Yu's head seemed to swell slightly.

Yun Yuqing, standing nearby, said coldly, "Zhang Yu, being in the top 50 of the university is impressive, but it doesn't make you above the law. You're not even in the top 20, let alone the top 10. If you're connected to the Demonic Sect, they'll arrest you without hesitation..."

Before Yun Yuqing could finish her sentence, the ranking above Zhang Yu's head suddenly began to change.

First, the Overall Department Ranking flickered, jumping from 13th to 12th, then to 10th, 8th... finally settling at 6th.

Then the Overall School Ranking began to flash wildly, leaping from 44th to 35th in one breath, then to 21st, before flickering again and, under the astonished gaze of True Person Rising Sun and Yun Yuqing, settling at 19th.

"Top 20 in the entire school?" Yun Yuqing exclaimed, her eyes wide with shock. "What did you do? How could your ranking skyrocket like that?"

Zhang Yu glanced at the "19th Overall" above his head and smiled faintly. "Didn't you ever win any competitions when you were at school?"

Yun Yuqing remained incredulous, thinking, "How could it jump so high?!"

True Person Rising Sun's expression shifted slightly as he thought, "Such a massive leap in ranking... he must have taken first place in the Hundred Schools Design Competition."

True Person Rising Sun stood up. "Congratulations, Student Yu."

Watching their retreating figures, Zhang Yu sent another message to Zhang Pianpian, inquiring about further details.

Meanwhile, shortly after True Person Rising Sun and Yun Yuqing left Zhang Yu's room, they both received urgent messages from their superiors.

"Who authorized you to investigate the 19th-ranked student in the entire school? Did you follow proper procedures? Have you no organizational discipline left? Are you trying to overthrow the system?"

True Person Rising Sun sighed helplessly. "He wasn't even ranked that high a minute ago."

"Don't give me excuses! Vice-Principal Cloud Haven just ordered the collection of materials to publicly commend Zhang Yu for achieving first place across all hundred schools."

"You'll have to explain your unauthorized investigation of the 19th-ranked student to the school leadership yourselves."

As the superior officer's furious reprimand echoed, Yun Yuqing's face paled beside him.

Meanwhile.

In the Investment Management Office of Myriad Laws University.

True Person Ink Fiend entered the office to find the director engaged in lively conversation with a stranger.

Seeing True Person Ink Fiend enter, the director waved him over and said, "Ink Fiend, this is True Person Rising Clouds from the Myriad Paths Group."

Turning to the other man, the director added, "This is True Person Ink Fiend from our office, specializing in matters related to the Artifact Refinement Department students."

Upon hearing the name "Myriad Paths Group," True Person Ink Fiend's heart skipped a beat. He knew this was a giant corporation originating from the sixth layer and above, a highly profitable conglomerate under the sect's jurisdiction — a company among companies, a group among groups.

True Person Ink Fiend quickly greeted True Person Rising Clouds.

True Person Rising Clouds smiled faintly and said, "Let's get straight to the point. The group has been actively expanding into emerging markets. Recently, our leadership reviewed the entries for the Magic Artifact Design Competition and became particularly interested in Zhang Yu's first-place winning design. They've asked me to visit Myriad Laws University to explore potential collaborations with Student Zhang Yu."

True Person Rising Clouds had come here because, according to common practice, outstanding students in the Artifact Refinement Department typically signed various contracts with the university.

For instance, the university would provide the majority of the Spirit Coin funding for establishing laboratories, research institutes, and companies, and in return, it would act as the students' patent agent.

True Person Rising Clouds assumed Zhang Yu would be no different.

Hearing this, the director chuckled heartily. As the head of the Investment Management Office, he had been under immense pressure since the economic crisis.

Although he had finally caught his breath as the economy gradually recovered, he was now burdened by countless targets and tasks.

The news that the Myriad Paths Group wanted to collaborate with students from the Artifact Refinement Department was a windfall for his performance metrics.

While student investments had never been a significant portion of his portfolio or a primary focus, any association with the Myriad Paths Group would undoubtedly boost his performance record.

It was precisely because True Monarch Grand Harmony's main focus lay in financial, commercial, and real estate investments, leaving him unfamiliar with student projects, that he had summoned True Person Ink Fiend.

True Person Ink Fiend paused slightly. "First place... Zhang Yu?"

True Person Rising Clouds from the Myriad Paths Group smiled faintly. "Although the official awards ceremony hasn't taken place yet, the rankings are essentially finalized. The data should already be synchronized with Myriad Laws University."

"Of course, the key is Student Yu's design. We're genuinely interested in it."

True Monarch Grand Harmony, director of the Investment Management Office, asked, "Ink Fiend, what's the situation with Zhang Yu's company? Tell us about it."

True Person Ink Fiend quickly sent a message: Director, it seems we... haven't invested in Zhang Yu. We don't own his copyrights or any shares in his company.

True Monarch Grand Harmony: How could we not invest in such a promising student?

True Person Ink Fiend: He's only a senior, and he just transferred to the Artifact Refinement Department recently...

True Person Rising Clouds glanced at the two of them. "Is there a problem?"

True Monarch Grand Harmony smiled faintly. "No problem at all. We'll contact Zhang Yu right away."

---

Zhang Pianpian: According to the Patrol Team's investigation, Shui Haiyu was taken by the Dual Rest Cult.

Zhang Pianpian: There's no record of him being detained by a Righteous God of the Spirit Realm.

Zhang Yu: Did someone hijack the Spirit Realm at the time?

Zhang Pianpian: It's still uncertain.

Zhang Yu was reviewing Zhang Pianpian's messages when he noticed a friend request from someone named True Person Ink Fiend.

Seeing that the person wanted to buy his design blueprints, Zhang Yu frowned slightly and didn't respond immediately.

As soon as he disembarked from the Flying Boat, True Person Ink Fiend directly intercepted him.

"Student Zhang Yu, right?" True Person Ink Fiend glanced at the ranking above Zhang Yu's head, his expression growing even more enthusiastic. "The school leaders were thrilled to hear you won first place in the Design Competition."

Zhang Yu, no longer a newcomer to Kunxu, grew increasingly wary of the man's excessive enthusiasm. "What do you want?"

True Person Ink Fiend: "I'm True Person Ink Fiend from the Investment Management Office. The school wants to invest in promising talents like you."

"Your design blueprints haven't been sold yet, have they?"

"The school is prepared to offer a high price to acquire them all."

Zhang Yu replied, "I'm sorry, I'm busy right now. Let's discuss this later."

True Person Ink Fiend quickly blocked his path. "Wait, Student Yu! Our director wants to meet you..."

Just then, a projection materialized before Zhang Yu.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole's voice rang out calmly: "Ink Fiend, my disciple and I have matters to discuss. The Investment Management Office can wait."

As the pair walked away, a flicker of resentment crossed Ink Fiend's face.
