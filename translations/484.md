# Chapter 484: Divine Spiritual Root and Blockade (Seeking Monthly Tickets)

True Monarch Celestial Seal readily agreed to Nine Heavens Liu's request.

He led Nine Heavens Liu to the laboratory housing the Yin Artifact. After activating the device, Jade Nectar Maiden Forty-Eight remained unresponsive.

True Monarch Celestial Seal chuckled awkwardly. "The Yin Artifact is still somewhat imperfect. Not everyone can successfully use it."

Nine Heavens Liu said disappointedly, "So, I don't meet the requirements?"

"Can't it be forcibly activated?"

"Or violently hacked?"

True Monarch Celestial Seal replied, "The Magnetic Pole faction is concerned that forcibly hacking it might result in data loss. I believe there's a real risk of that."

"Besides, we've already achieved significant progress. There's no need to take unnecessary risks."

"I believe that if we continue along our current path, achieving mass production is only a matter of time..."

"When that happens, the entire Dual Cultivation market will be transformed by us. All universities will face an unprecedented storm. We will reshape the world!"

As True Monarch Celestial Seal continued his grandiose pronouncements, Nine Heavens Liu stared at the Yin Artifact before him and suddenly said, "You can hear me, right?"

"If you cooperate and help me enhance my Cultivation, I'll give you money. How about that?"

"Fifty Spirit Coins just for trying? What do you say?"

Seeing the Yin Artifact's complete lack of response, True Monarch Celestial Seal explained, "This Yin Artifact has been sealed by True Monarch Magnetic Pole. Not only is its intelligence suppressed, but it's also unable to communicate externally."

Nine Heavens Liu chuckled. "Looks like I was just being wishful."

"For specialized tasks, it's best to leave it to the professionals."

Meanwhile, back in her own chambers, True Monarch Magnetic Pole's mind flashed with Nine Heavens Liu's image. She mused inwardly, "Now that Divine Monarch Golden Citadel sees a chance for profit, he wants to invest more and grab a share of the pie?"

True Monarch Magnetic Pole was already accustomed to this.

She understood that the three Divine Monarchs of Myriad Laws University held differing views on the University War's trajectory and the university's future actions. This led to frequent conflicts among their disciples. Yet there were also many instances where the Divine Monarchs cooperated for mutual gain.

For example, the recent Jade Nectar Coin crash and the Yin Artifact rebellion, in True Monarch Magnetic Pole's view, bore the fingerprints of at least Divine Monarch Myriad Transformations and Divine Monarch Golden Citadel, both Soul Transformation stage cultivators who had profited handsomely from the chaos.

True Monarch Magnetic Pole knew that the three Divine Monarchs were bound by both rivalry and collaboration. Their complex relationship, forged over a thousand years, defied ordinary comprehension.

For them, only profit was eternal.

Shortly after Zhang Yu returned to his dormitory, his elder sister arrived.

After thoroughly checking to ensure he wasn't being monitored, Zhang Yu finally breathed a sigh of relief.

"Senior Sister," Zhang Yu said, "there might be some activity within me soon. Could you please watch over me and make sure no one notices?"

Zhang Pianpian nodded. She knew her younger brother, like herself, harbored secrets.

Just as Zhang Yu never pried into her secrets, she had no intention of questioning his.

As long as the flow of Spirit Coins continued and the familial bond remained strong, they would continue to protect and support each other within Kunxu.

Zhang Pianpian asked, "Does this have anything to do with the Spirit Realm?"

Zhang Yu shook his head. "It's just some internal changes."

"I understand," Zhang Pianpian replied. "Then it shouldn't be too serious."

"I'll go to the Supreme Clarity Realm and oversee things. While cultivating there, I can also use the resources to help you avoid being spied on."

Without pressing for details about Zhang Yu's plans, Zhang Pianpian's consciousness had already departed for the Supreme Clarity Realm.

A moment later, Zhang Yu received a message from Zhang Pianpian.

Zhang Pianpian: You can start now.

Zhang Yu took a deep breath and switched the Third Eye Mystic Power (Spiritual Root) on the Dao Seed Register to the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo (Spiritual Root).

In the next instant, he felt the Azure Lotus Sword Embryo vibrate slightly within his body. However, the anticipated transformation didn't occur, and his body showed no signs of losing control or manifesting any unusual phenomena.

"Could it be because I spent too little time inside A-Zhen's body that the changes are minimal?"

After examining the Divine Spiritual Root, Zhang Yu found it appeared unchanged.

"Let's test it."

Zhang Yu believed the Divine Spiritual Root's greatest enhancement lay in its strengthening of the Chain Method Diagram Set.

Through daily use, this enhancement had steadily increased. Compared to its initial 1% effect, it had now grown significantly.

Today, Zhang Yu tested it again, mentally noting: "The University Holy Body's enhancement is nearing 15%, the Civil Engineering Holy Body is nearly 13%, Qi Meridian Everflow is almost 6%, and the Martial Dao Holy Body is nearly 12%."

"The University Holy Body and Martial Dao Holy Body, being used most frequently, are growing the fastest."

"The data aligns with my previous tests."

"No change at all?"

Just as Zhang Yu frowned slightly, thinking his efforts had been in vain, he received a message from True Monarch Magnetic Pole regarding the new contracts for the Laboratory's test subjects.

"Forty Spirit Coins per month?"

"If you engage in Dual Cultivation with Yin Artifacts, the price is calculated separately per session, with a minimum of fifteen Spirit Coins per session..."

"So lucrative?"

"As expected, researching the Immortal Dao and scamming the school for funding is far more profitable than working on construction sites!"

"Hmm, you still need a good Teacher to lead the project."

Despite the added confidentiality clauses and stricter requirements, Zhang Yu couldn't help but burst into laughter at the income figures, feeling an overwhelming joy surge through him.

As this joy continued to well up, Zhang Yu sensed his vital energy surging, his Magic Power accelerating, and a subtle, inexplicable change occurring within his body.

"Hmm? This sensation..."

Zhang Yu quickly conducted another test and discovered that his Divine Spiritual Root seemed to have been strengthened under the influence of this joyful emotion.

"The improvement to the Chain Method Diagram Set is slightly greater now."

"0.5%? Or is it 0.3%?"

"It's too subtle."

Though the change was minuscule, Zhang Yu felt a surge of excitement.

"Can my Divine Spiritual Root now be strengthened through emotional fluctuations?"

"Hmm, A-Zhen mentioned that her Seven Emotions Sword Dao works similarly, enhancing sword techniques through the seven emotions."

"It seems my Divine Spiritual Root has gained a similar enhancement."

Zhang Yu nodded in satisfaction, then sighed inwardly. "It's a pity I haven't spent enough time with A-Zhen."

He opened Bai Zhenzhen's profile and sent her a message, but received no response.

"Ah, I wonder what's happened to A-Zhen."

"If everything were fine, she would have messaged me immediately."

Moments later, Director Gao sent him several old news articles from decades ago, some nearly a century old.

Director Gao: "Sword Cultivator's Love Triangle Ends in Murder! Joyous Union Saintess Gruesomely Cooked Alive!"

Director Gao: "Tragic Family Massacre! Father and Son Clash, Leading to Clan's Ruin!"

Director Gao: "Heavenly Sword University Prodigy Dies Horribly, Soul Shattered! Who Will Repay His Debts?"

Zhang Yu opened his mouth, wondering what Old Gao was sending him."

Director Gao: "These old news articles might be worth a look if you have time."

Zhang Yu thought, "As if I have time for this."

After a moment's hesitation, he bookmarked the articles, planning to read them later.

He then glanced at Bai Zhenzhen's dimmed profile picture, his gaze suddenly sharpening. Using his own account, he sent a message to Wen Wuya.

Zhang Yu: "Wen Wuya, do you know how Bai Zhenzhen is doing?"

Wen Wuya: "She's undergoing special training with Divine Monarch Seven Emotions."

Wen Wuya: "Why? Do you want to contact her?"

Zhang Yu's heart skipped a beat. He replied: "Would you be willing to help?"

---

Wen Wuya looked at the message from Zhang Yu, a faint smile curving his lips.

Shortly after Zhang Yu left and Bai Zhenzhen entered seclusion, Wen Wuya had contacted his teacher, Divine Monarch Heavenly Star, to seek his opinion.

As Wen Wuya had anticipated, Divine Monarch Heavenly Star showed great interest in Myriad Laws University's breakthroughs in Yin Artifact technology and the potential conflict brewing between Myriad Laws University and Joyful Union University.

When Wen Wuya expressed his desire to connect with Zhang Yu while avoiding wasting time on Bai Zhenzhen and fearing Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' threats, Divine Monarch Heavenly Star advised him to pursue any opportunity that offered benefits, assuring him that he would handle the minimal risks posed by Divine Monarch Seven Emotions.

Wen Wuya thought to himself, "Now that they've lost contact, I can serve as the intermediary between them."

Soon after, Zhang Yu looked at the photo Wen Wuya had sent and felt a surge of excitement. He replied, "Is that A-Zhen's hand?"

Wen Wuya: "That's my hand."

"You fucking..." Zhang Yu gritted his teeth and replied: What's the point of sending this?

Wen Wuya: "You want me to just give you the information directly?"

Wen Wuya: "Can't you crack it yourself?"

Wen Wuya: "You need me to teach you how?"

Wen Wuya: "You really haven't mastered any Spirit Realm information technology, have you?"

Zhang Yu awkwardly tugged at the corner of his mouth before forwarding the photo to Zhang Pianpian, asking for help cracking it.

A moment later, the photo transformed into a short video and was sent back to Zhang Yu.

In the video, Bai Zhenzhen smiled and said, "Yu Zi, I'm fine. The old woman will probably just lock me up until the Ten Great Leagues, then I'll be out."

Seeing Bai Zhenzhen in the video, Zhang Yu breathed a slight sigh of relief. He then asked Zhang Pianpian, "Could this video be fake?"

Zhang Pianpian: "I didn't detect any signs of forgery."

At the same time, Wen Wuya sent another message: "I can help you relay any messages in the future."

Wen Wuya: "I'll also visit Zhenzhen often and pass on any news to you."

Zhang Yu: "Thank you."

Wen Wuya: "No need to thank me. The deal we discussed last time is still valid anytime. [heart]"

Zhang Yu's body stiffened, a chill running through him. He didn't reply to Wen Wuya's message.

Knowing Bai Zhenzhen was safe for now and having a lead on his Divine Spiritual Root, Zhang Yu left his dorm, eager to return to the construction site project.

He had been away from the site for nearly a day to participate in the Civil Engineering League.

But just as he was about to exit Myriad Laws University's University City, a series of crimson warnings materialized before him, forcibly preventing him from leaving.
