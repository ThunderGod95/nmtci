# Chapter 640: The Final Four - Daughter of Seven Emotions

As Zhang Yu watched Tian Shengong and Yan Xiang clash, he could almost see their resources dwindling with each exchange.

To him, the fierce battle resembled the classic martial arts trope of two masters locking palms and competing with their inner energy.

Except here, the contest wasn't about inner energy, but about their respective assets.

"Will Tian Shengong's half-finished puppets be exhausted first?"

"Or will Yan Xiang's prefabricated Corpse Demons run out first?"

The answer quickly became clear to Zhang Yu.

"Though Tian Shengong's puppets are assembled on-site, their low cost and adaptability to the battlefield give them a significant advantage."

"In contrast, Yan Xiang's prefabricated Corpse Demons are limited in number and lack the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions."

"Tian Shengong's strategy is just like their Extreme Tiger brand."

"Higher cost-effectiveness, lower prices, and overwhelming numbers to crush the opponent completely."

After observing this battle, Zhang Yu turned his attention to the final match: Bai Zhenzhen's clash with Cang Shenyu of Vajra University.

As soon as he tuned in, he heard Cang Shenyu reciting an advertisement.

Cang Shenyu's advertising slogans were remarkably rhythmic, sounding to Zhang Yu like the chanting of scriptures.

Though ostensibly reciting advertisements, it felt as if he were constantly chanting "Amitabha," calmly broadcasting information about various products and brands.

While watching the match, Zhang Yu learned that Cang Shenyu's entire Bionic suit had been refined from the physical bodies of Vajra University's most outstanding body refinement students.

Only the finest hands, strongest arms, fastest feet, and most powerful legs from Vajra University's elite would be transformed into military-grade Bionics and installed on Cang Shenyu's body.

Furthermore, since every Vajra University student underwent gradual standardization of their body dimensions from the moment they enrolled, these Bionics achieved near-perfect compatibility with Cang Shenyu's physical body, maximizing their performance.

When Cang Shenyu activated his military-grade cultivation technique, his entire being, synchronized with the Bionic suit, entered a state akin to a magical artifact.

Observing this, Zhang Yu thought to himself, "The Artifact Refinement Department at Vajra University seems to be dominated by the Magical Artifact Faction. Their ultimate goal must be to refine themselves into living magical artifacts."

At that moment, Cang Shenyu's prison had transformed into an incredibly resilient magical artifact, impervious to Bai Zhenzhen's attacks. Even her crimson sword qi couldn't leave a scratch on its surface.

Faced with such a formidable opponent, Bai Zhenzhen had no choice but to further push her Extreme Emotion Sword Dao, unleashing another devastating black sword qi.

But when she saw that her hard-won breakthrough of his Bionic had been instantly countered by him simply switching to a spare Bionic, Bai Zhenzhen realized that such tactics alone wouldn't secure her victory.

She needed not just momentary bursts of power, but a sustained, enduring force capable of maintaining peak output over extended periods.

Cang Shenyu smiled faintly. "At Vajra University, the most exceptional students never rely solely on their feet or hands."

Bai Zhenzhen slowly drew the flying sword bestowed upon her by Divine Monarch Seven Emotions, silently murmuring, "Senior sister, let's do this."

Through relentless cultivation, the trials of the Ten Greats League, and the empowerment of her Feather Spirit Root, Bai Zhenzhen had finally forged a connection with this military-grade flying sword.

Through this, she finally learned the origin of the flying sword.

The flying sword was the transformed form of the Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' daughter.

Because the Divine Monarch Seven Emotions' daughter was named Lian Yuhuan, the flying sword was called the Yuhuan Sword.

After using the Yuhuan Sword, Bai Zhenzhen realized... due to the Sword Spirit's unique origin, experiences, and memories, every Extreme Emotion Sword Dao cultivator who wielded it would witness scenes of their closest loved ones being wantonly humiliated.

At that moment, as Bai Zhenzhen's black sword qi resonated with the Yuhuan Sword, her body seemed to merge with the sword artifact.

The Yuhuan Sword's voice echoed in her mind: "Zhenzhen..."

"Zhang Yu... so moist..."

In Bai Zhenzhen's eyes, the Sword Spirit was slowly devouring Zhang Yu's figure.

Though the scene was illusory, it evoked genuine reactions, stirring real emotions within her.

Simultaneously, within Bai Zhenzhen's dark eyes, all traces of emotion gradually extinguished.

Watching this unfold, Wen Wuya sighed inwardly, "Zhenzhen is straying further and further down the Demonic Path."

"Fake videos and photos were already a descent into the Demonic Path."

"But now she's using a Sword Spirit to create synthetic scenarios, actively plunging herself into an Illusionary Realm."

"If she can't distinguish between reality and illusion in the future... she'll either become completely numb, forever unable to advance her Extreme Emotion Sword Dao."

"That would be the better outcome."

Wen Wuya thought to himself, "A worse scenario would be complete madness."

As black sword qi soared into the sky, Cang Shenyu was eventually cut down into a human stake amidst the fierce battles. Bai Zhenzhen, under the intervention of a Righteous God, was forcibly subdued, her Yuhuan Sword seized. Only after gradually regaining her senses was she returned to the waiting area.

Watching Bai Zhenzhen, heavily suppressed by divine light and completely sealed off, Zhang Yu was about to approach her. But remembering the Spiritual Root within her, he instead sent a message: A-Zhen? How are you?

Zhang Yu: Are you alright?

After a long silence, Bai Zhenzhen finally replied: Yu Zi, I'm fine.

Bai Zhenzhen: Just a little angry, a little scared, a little frightened, and a little relieved.

Zhang Yu: ?

Bai Zhenzhen: Do you remember what it feels like to dream?

Zhang Yu paused, thinking, "A dream? That seems like a distant memory now."

Bai Zhenzhen continued, "It's like dreaming you've gone bankrupt, then waking up to find everything's fine."

Bai Zhenzhen: "Even though it's fine, the fear from the dream lingers, but there's also relief that it was just a dream."

Bai Zhenzhen: "But no matter what, we've finally made it to the top four! [Laughing emoji]"

Zhang Yu nodded, looking at the final bracket. "Yeah, we're in the top four."

Reflecting on the journey from high school to his freshman year of college, and now as a fifth-year senior, Zhang Yu felt a momentary daze. He hadn't imagined he would reach this point, step by step.

At the same time, the schedule for the matches seven days later was revealed: Zhang Yu versus Tian Shengong, and Bai Zhenzhen versus Kuang Tianqing.

Seeing the arrangement, Zhang Yu's expression darkened slightly. "A-Zhen, you have to fight within your limits in the next match."

Bai Zhenzhen: "Don't worry, I'm not going to fight a losing battle."

Meanwhile, Bai Zhenzhen stared at the names in her Bionic Eye — her own and Kuang Tianqing's — and thought to herself, "Kuang Tianqing, I'm so glad I get to face you again."

---

As this round of the competition concluded, news once again flooded the Spirit Realm, and Zhang Yu's comment section erupted into another fierce battle.

Particularly after he purchased Ying Mingchi's Monster Blood to create a dragon beast, a surprising number of monsterfolk began supporting him, leading to heated arguments with other monsterfolk in the comment section and elsewhere.

However, Zhang Yu paid little attention to this, focusing entirely on preparing for his next match.

True Monarch Tranquility said, "Your next opponent is Tian Shengong."

"Tian Shengong is backed not only by the Immortal Arms Group but also by significant investment from Extreme Tiger."

"Given your current fame and reputation, Extreme Tiger will likely pour vast sums into Tian Shengong to ensure your complete defeat."

Zhang Yu understood this perfectly. As a thorn in the side and a dagger in the heart of countless Extreme Tiger fans, he had repeatedly gained popularity in the Spirit Realm by trampling on Extreme Tiger's reputation. He had undoubtedly become a prime target for Extreme Tiger's retaliation.

"If it weren't for my status as a student at Myriad Laws University and the fact that we're currently in the midst of the Ten Greats League, Extreme Tiger would have already made a move against me."

"But in my next battle against Tian Shengong, they'll never let me win."

Zhang Yu didn't need to think hard to realize the devastating blow his victory over Tian Shengong would deal to the Extreme Tiger Society.

However, Zhang Yu wasn't fighting alone.

He turned to True Monarch Tranquility and asked, "How much support can the school offer me now?"

Seeing Zhang Yu's victory over Nine Heavens Liu, True Monarch Tranquility replied, "State your requests."

Zhang Yu's eyes flickered. Through his recent battles, he had been refining his combat framework, constantly adjusting the performance of his magical artifacts and Bionics.

During this process, he had gradually identified his weaknesses and conceived several directions for improvement.

Among these, the most crucial, in his view, was...

"The Seven Absolutes Bionic," Zhang Yu said. "I want to remove this set of Seven Absolutes Bionic from my body and completely overhaul all seven components, achieving a transformative upgrade."

True Monarch Tranquility frowned slightly. "This Seven Absolutes Bionic belongs to Mo Shangjin of the Civil Engineering Department, right? The school can purchase it for you without any issues."

"But a complete overhaul... that leaves you with only a week. Just drafting the design blueprint alone..."

Zhang Yu replied, "Leave the design blueprint to me."

"I've been preparing for this Seven Absolutes Bionic modification for a long time and have received extensive guidance from my Master."

He said with unwavering conviction, "After all, the Seven Absolutes Bionic is already a top-tier expert-grade Bionic. With proper modifications and by combining the power of all seven Bionics, it can unleash even greater capabilities."

"The modified Seven Absolutes Bionic is precisely what I believe best suits me, aligns with my combat framework, and maximizes my chances of victory."

Sensing the determination in Zhang Yu's eyes, True Monarch Tranquility nodded slightly. "Even with the design blueprint, it's still a tight deadline. Moreover, True Monarch Magnetic Pole is currently in seclusion and won't have time for artifact refinement."

Zhang Yu said, "Therefore, I need at least seven Nascent Soul True Monarchs from the Artifact Refinement Department to collaborate and simultaneously complete the modifications to my Seven Absolutes Bionic."

True Monarch Tranquility couldn't help but ask, "Seven Nascent Soul True Monarchs refining these seven Bionics together?"

Seven Nascent Soul True Monarchs working together on artifact refinement for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, following his design, his specifications, and his commands.

True Monarch Tranquility thought to himself that under normal circumstances, Zhang Yu would have to pay an astronomical price to achieve this.

But now, with the Ten Greats League progressing and the school's support for Zhang Yu, this was no longer an impossible dream.

True Monarch Tranquility said, "I'll do my best to invite them."

Zhang Yu smiled slightly, knowing that with someone of True Monarch Tranquility's status making such a statement, the matter was already eighty to ninety percent settled.

True Monarch Tranquility continued, "But your design blueprint..."

Zhang Yu replied, "I'll finalize it as soon as possible."

True Monarch Tranquility said, "Not only must it be quick, but it also needs to pass the review of all the Nascent Soul True Monarchs. Otherwise, I won't be able to persuade them to participate in this refinement."
