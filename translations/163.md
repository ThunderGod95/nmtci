# Chapter 163: A Rematch with Yu Xinghan

Applying his control over his physical strength to the process of digesting food, even striking himself with full-powered palm attacks to aid his eating...

This was something the Zhang Yu of the past had never done.

But thanks to his terrifying skill in physical strength, Zhang Yu mastered it very quickly.

At first, he needed to strike his lower abdomen with full force, one palm at a time, to stimulate the compression of his digestive tract.

But soon, his movements became lighter, and the sound of his palm strikes grew quieter.

This indicated that he was becoming more familiar with the process of using his physical strength to interfere with his digestive system, and his control over the flow and guidance of his physical power was becoming more adept.

In the end, it seemed as if Zhang Yu were just gently patting his stomach, but each pat sent a series of tremors through his entire body, emitting a low, muffled sound.

He could feel the fine threads of palm force passing through his muscles, fat, and internal organs, pulverizing and compressing the food in his stomach, allowing him to eat a few more mouthfuls of synthetic food.

Zhang Yu's actions didn't just catch Meng Tao's attention; soon, other students who were falling behind began to imitate him, trying to speed up their own digestion. However, after just a few attempts, they felt a dull ache in their internal organs and were on the verge of suffering internal injuries.

A minor god had been observing Zhang Yu's movements and constantly monitoring the data transmitted from the sensor patch.

He commented, "This Zhang Yu has extremely strong control over his own physical strength."

"With each palm strike, not only can he accurately transmit the force to the food in his stomach, but he can also avoid injuring his internal organs in the process, and sometimes even incorporate his organs into the circulation of power."

"This level of skill... doesn't seem like something a first-year high school student from Songyang City can achieve."

"He's not cheating, is he?"

Huang Zichou said coolly, "Since he can achieve this through skill, how can it be considered cheating? The skill of physical strength is a part of one's power."

"It's just that in this examination hall, those who can perform such a technique already have sufficiently strong bodies and digestive abilities and don't need to supplement it with this kind of skill."

"On the other hand, those who want to use this technique to improve their score don't have the ability and are more likely to injure themselves."

The other minor god then said, "Sigh, I still think it's better to compete on drug resistance than eating capacity. Taking alchemical enhancers is the most important ability for body tempering."

Another minor god nodded in deep agreement.

Huang Zichou remained silent, merely glancing at the agreeing minor god, wondering how much money he had taken from pharmaceutical companies.

_There has indeed been a recent wave of support for replacing the exam with alchemical enhancer usage, believing that it can both measure a student's strength and potential by the amount they take, and also sell enhancers and complete experiments at the same time._

_I wonder who's pulling the strings behind the scenes..._

While the righteous gods were conversing, Zhang Yu's eating speed had increased, and in the blink of an eye, he had caught up to 16th place.

And ahead of him was Yu Xinghan, who had already reached 15th place.

Yu Xinghan also noticed Zhang Yu catching up. _Oh? He's caught up, has he?_

Looking at the light screen, at the number 55 bar that was still growing after reaching 16th place, a slight smile appeared on Yu Xinghan's lips.

At that moment, the image of Zhang Yu sprinting with all his might, constantly chasing after him during the sports competition months ago, flashed through his mind.

That time, although Yu Xinghan had bested him in the race, he had lost to him in the subsequent Sky Pillar event.

Although it was due to Senior Sister Li Xuelian's misjudgment that he couldn't use his full strength in the Sky Pillar event and thus missed out on the championship...

It would be impossible to say he had no regrets.

_But this time..._ a flicker of excitement rose in Yu Xinghan's heart, _there's no one here to hold me back and stop me from using my full strength._

With this thought, Yu Xinghan abruptly stopped eating.

Zhang Yu looked at the light screen, at the person ahead of him, at the number 31 bar that had stopped growing, and was slightly taken aback.

_Number 31 is that guy Yu Xinghan, right?_

The next moment, as if he had realized something, he turned to look at Yu Xinghan and met a pair of eyes filled with fighting spirit.

_This guy..._ Zhang Yu felt as if he had returned to the race track from months ago, seeing Yu Xinghan rapidly backing up to start at the same line as him for a high-speed sprint.

_Wants to have a showdown with me?_

Zhang Yu and Yu Xinghan locked eyes, their intense fighting spirit seeming to clash in the air.

3!

2!

1!

As if by unspoken agreement, three seconds later, both of them roared in their hearts and began to frantically devour the synthetic food in front of them.

Loud gulping sounds, mixed with the croaking of his internal organs, made Yu Xinghan seem like a giant demonic beast, wolfing down the synthetic food in the barrel.

But as the synthetic food in the barrel dwindled and he turned to grab another barrel to continue his feast...

Yu Xinghan was surprised to find that on the light screen, not only had the gap in their food consumption not widened, but it was gradually closing.

_This guy... is still catching up?_

Seeing this, beads of sweat began to form on Yu Xinghan's forehead.

Then, the sweat started to flow more and more.

This was not because he was nervous, anxious, or afraid.

It was because this sweat represented his all-out effort.

As a student at White Dragon High School, he too had long since undergone the digestive system modification surgery.

When he started to sweat, it meant that his digestive system had begun to operate at high intensity.

At this moment, his stomach and intestines were like a giant furnace, frantically crushing and pulverizing all the food he swallowed, sending waves of heat throughout his body.

Large amounts of metabolic waste were then continuously expelled through his sweat glands under this high temperature, turning into beads of sweat that flowed down his body.

But...

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A series of thunderous roars continuously came from Zhang Yu's direction.

The food barrel was overturned on the table, and Zhang Yu lay underneath it.

The synthetic food fell like a waterfall as he opened his mouth wide to swallow it.

At the same time, his hands were continuously striking his own body.

One palm strike after another, it was as if thunder was constantly exploding in mid-air.

At this moment, Zhang Yu gave Yu Xinghan the impression of a thunder god constantly beating a divine drum, rapidly chasing after him with the continuous sound of thunder.

Watching the gap between them on the light screen continue to shrink, the sweat flowing from Yu Xinghan's body gradually took on a whitish tint.

This white-tinted sweat was a sign that he was now genuinely feeling the pressure.

The undigested protein in his sweat meant that in his pursuit of speed, he had chosen to not fully digest the food.

_Still not enough..._

Watching Zhang Yu continuously catching up on the light screen, feeling the increasingly dense and booming thunderous sounds...

Yu Xinghan's gaze grew more solemn, and the sweat flowing from him gradually turned from pale white to milky white.

And as his sweat became whiter, Yu Xinghan's data growth also became faster, finally temporarily maintaining the gap between him and Zhang Yu.

...

While Zhang Yu and Yu Xinghan were competing fiercely...

Bai Zhenzhen, who had dropped to 21st place, also felt a sense of danger.

_I need to think of something._

Bai Zhenzhen rubbed her ever-growing belly and thought, _I'm about to puke._

_I need to find a way to digest this._

But as her rank continued to fall, Bai Zhenzhen only felt herself becoming calmer.

_Is this the effect of the Cold Soul Ice Heart Art?_

_I feel my qi and blood becoming more and more active._

_My mind also seems clearer than ever before._

At this moment, Bai Zhenzhen felt as if all her data, techniques, and abilities were displayed in her mind in great detail, like weapons she could choose from at will.

At the same time, all the information from the examination hall constantly appeared before her eyes, flowing into her mind as various pieces of intelligence.

One idea after another emerged, only to be carefully considered and then discarded.

Finally, Bai Zhenzhen's gaze landed on Zhang Yu.

_Yu-boy's method is good._

_But I can't just copy it._

_I need to find a method that suits me..._

Bai Zhenzhen's mind flashed through her martial arts, the Level 10 effect of the Thunderclap True Body, and its deduced effect.

The Level 10 Thunderclap True Body made Bai Zhenzhen's body more resilient, allowing her to maintain a high-speed state for a longer period.

And after deducing it with her True Spiritual Root, the Level 10 Thunderclap True Body further enhanced this resilience, even allowing Bai Zhenzhen's muscles to act as a buffer and absorb energy when at full speed.

With this thought, an idea had already formed in Bai Zhenzhen's mind.

Her body began to sway slowly, and as the speed of her swaying increased, it gradually turned from swaying to vibrating, and then to high-speed vibration.

Her powerful body and martial arts cultivation allowed her body and internal organs to remain healthy even under this high-speed vibration.

And the food that was previously difficult to digest was now continuously pulverized, broken down, and even turned into liquid under this high-speed vibration.

Relying on the high-speed vibration of her body, Bai Zhenzhen finally began to speed up her eating, rushing from 21st place to 20th, and then began to charge towards 19th.

And in 19th place was Li Tongyun, who was constantly sweating white.

As her eating speed began to decline, her sense of despair deepened.

She struggled to swallow the synthetic food in her mouth, but it felt like the dirt-like substance had already clogged her up from her intestines all the way to her throat.

Huang Zichou commented, "This Li Tongyun has reached her limit."

Another minor god chuckled, "After having diarrhea for so long, her digestive system can't take it anymore?"

Huang Zichou said, "It's fine for a short burst, but how could she possibly last the whole way with that?"

Li Tongyun thought of the gambling contract, of her parents on the verge of bankruptcy, and wanted to force a little more synthetic food into her stomach.

But as if she had reached some kind of limit, with a soft 'pop', she violently spat out all the synthetic food in her mouth.

_No..._

She was already ranked after 20th in the mana exam. If she also fell below 20th in the physical exam, then in Li Tongyun's eyes, this round of the Foundation Establishment exam would be a definite failure for her.

The thought of the consequences of becoming company property, fear, coiled around her heart like a venomous snake.

As the daughter of a former company leader, she knew all too well that once she became company property, her body, her flesh, and even her soul would no longer belong to her.

_I really can't lose..._

Almost subconsciously, Li Tongyun stuffed all the vomit back into her mouth and continued to force-feed herself from the large barrel.

But no matter how she struggled, it was futile. She had reached her limit, and in the end, she could only watch helplessly as her rank continued to fall.
