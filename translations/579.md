# Chapter 579: What a Fiendish Beast! Daring to Conduct Unauthorized Construction!

Myriad Laws University, ranked among the top universities in the Ten Greats, boasted a renowned military-grade power as its flagship discipline. Even Xiang Shan, who studied at Celestial Monsters University far away, had heard of it.

After learning he would be working on a project at Myriad Laws University, Xiang Shan delved deeper into the university's intelligence.

He had read about the Artifact Refinement Department's legendary Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation, a technique he had only encountered in literature.

Yet he never imagined Zhang Yu could actually wield this military-grade power.

Recalling Zhang Yu's earlier actions, Xiang Shan's expression grew grave.

"The essence of a flying sword's cutting power lies in compressing matter."

"The Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation cuts the Spirit Realm by using an inner network of twelve flying swords to compress the Spirit Realm."

"In ancient times, this Great Sun Inner Net was known as the Great Sky Sword Realm..."

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Xiang Shan sensed a surging heat rising from the depths below.

Fiery hands materialized, desperately trying to stabilize the violently shaking earth.

"Besides compressing the Spirit Realm, the Great Sky Sword Realm can also transmit power within the sword formation's range," Xiang Shan realized.

He knew Zhang Yu was using the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation to channel the Eternal Sun Radiance Flame unleashed by the Heavenly Sun Radiance God directly into the ground, combining it with the Heavenly Kunlun Mountain-Moving Divine Power to stabilize the earth.

Simultaneously, flames surged both above and below, making Xiang Shan and his classmates feel like they were trapped in a giant oven, their bodies growing hotter by the second.

"Zhang Yu!" Xiang Shan roared. "Are you trying to burn down Celestial Monsters University's construction site? If a single monsterfolk dies today, I'll report you to the Principal of Myriad Laws University!"

Zhang Yu's voice drifted down from the sky, calm and detached. "The Earth Vein is unstable, disrupting construction. I'm merely suppressing it temporarily. It'll be over soon. Please bear with it."

Xiang Shan hadn't expected his outburst to stop Zhang Yu. In the next instant, he channeled his Magic Power, activating the rented military-grade Bionic — the Heavenly Phenomenon Bone.

In an instant, dark clouds surged across the sky, followed by thunderous roars and a torrential downpour that blanketed the entire world.

This wasn't a natural weather phenomenon governed by the Righteous Gods, but a small-scale atmospheric manipulation forcefully orchestrated by a military-grade magical artifact. Yet its power was not to be underestimated.

As the rain poured down relentlessly, the scorching heatwave that had been sweeping across the land began to subside.

"Hmph? Rain?" Zhang Yu sneered, his voice booming, "Then I'll burn this sky dry!"

In the next moment, channeling his Magic Power with reckless abandon, he unleashed the Eternal Sun Radiance Flame beneath the floating island. The flames surged outward, devouring mountains and stone, their intensity skyrocketing like a second sun blazing across the heavens.

Simultaneously, fiery dragon-shaped energy streams darted through the sword formation, carrying scorching heat deep underground, like molten lava surging through subterranean channels.

Sensing this, Xiang Shan let out a cold laugh. His vital energy erupted, and a set of white fangs suddenly elongated from his mouth. "Let's see how long you can keep burning!"

In the blink of an eye, the rain intensified, accompanied by icy currents that transformed the downpour into a sleet-like mix of rain and snow.

Xiang Shan and Zhang Yu clashed in a battle of water and fire, turning the construction site into a giant steam bath. The workers alternated between freezing and sweltering, caught in the crossfire of their magical duel.

Amidst the fierce combat, Xiang Shan couldn't help but marvel inwardly, "To think that Zhang Yu, whom I once drove into a corner and forced to rely on tricks for a narrow victory over a year ago, has already nearly caught up to me."

"The Artifact Refinement Department... ultimately holds an advantage over the Civil Engineering Department. If we were to clash again in a few months, even I might struggle to hold my own."

"This is undoubtedly my best chance to crush him."

With that thought, Xiang Shan unleashed his full cultivation power and activated his Bionic to its maximum potential.

Just then, a bone-chilling sensation swept over him like a bucket of ice water dumped overhead, causing his vital energy to sink.

"What is this...?"

Xiang Shan glanced at the bodily parameters displayed in his Bionic Eye, confirming that his body temperature hadn't actually dropped. The bone-chilling, icy sensation was merely a psychological illusion.

"It's the Sword Intent."

Xiang Shan suddenly recalled the description of the Great Sun Moral Sword Intent within the Great Sky Sacred Law Sword Formation.

"The Great Sun Moral Sword Intent is the sword formation's method for locking onto targets."

He further understood that while the Great Sun Moral Sword Intent wasn't particularly potent or precise when used to target purely physical locations, it became far more dangerous when directed at living beings.

"Once struck by the Sword Intent, we become as clear as flames in the darkness to the formation's caster..."

"And the greater the power of the Great Sun Moral Sword Intent, the more persistent and difficult to dispel it becomes."

At that moment, Xiang Shan sensed the intense hostility within the Sword Intent, clinging to him like a bone-burrowing maggot. Even with his cultivation level and unwavering dao heart, it would likely require several minutes of focused exertion to purge it.

Feeling the overwhelming hostility within the Sword Intent, Xiang Shan's suspicions were confirmed.

"The refinement of the Great Sun Moral Sword Intent is tied to the cultivator's moral standards."

"Zhang Yu's Sword Intent harbors such malice toward monsterfolk..."

"This guy really does harbor deep-seated prejudice against us."

At that moment, the monsterfolk workers on the construction site, locked down by the Great Sun Moral Sword Intent, felt as if countless razor-sharp sword artifacts were aimed at their vital points. Any misstep could result in them being torn to shreds.

Xiang Shan watched as countless alerts and pleas for help from his classmates and colleagues flooded his Bionic Eye. He immediately responded: Don't panic! Zhang Yu wouldn't dare kill monsters! He's just trying to intimidate us!

Though he said this, Xiang Shan knew it was like having a knife pressed to your throat during negotiations. Even if you knew the other party wouldn't kill you, you'd still be at a psychological disadvantage, forced into a weaker position.

Moreover, Zhang Yu's Great Sun Moral Sword Intent, in Xiang Shan's eyes, carried such extreme malice toward monsterfolk that it would easily terrify them.

Xiang Shan quickly added: Have you forgotten about the insurance we bought before coming here?

Xiang Shan: If you die, you get compensation. What are you afraid of?

Xiang Shan: If you have money, why fear death?

The insurance Xiang Shan mentioned was precisely the policy sold to the monsterfolk by the Finance Department of Myriad Laws University before the construction began.

Hearing Xiang Shan's words, the monsterfolk, who had been trembling under the oppressive Sword Intent, suddenly straightened their backs, as if a force had stiffened their spines. They now faced the Sword Intent with newfound defiance.

"Come on! If you have the guts, kill me!"

"Zhang Yu, you Human Race Immortal Daoist!"

"Senior Xiang Shan! If you can't hold out, use me as a Living Stake!"

The monsterfolk rallied, joining Xiang Shan in resisting the environmental changes Zhang Yu was causing.

Witnessing the monsterfolk's united front, their fearless determination against Zhang Yu's discriminatory pressure, Xiang Shan laughed heartily. "Zhang Yu! Do you see? You can't intimidate us!"

"The anthem of the monsterfolk is the anthem of courage! The greatness of the monsterfolk lies in the greatness of courage!"

"Celestial Monsters will prevail!"

Watching the monsterfolk below, their spirits soaring as if they had already won the magical duel, Zhang Yu curled his lips into a sneer. He lowered his sword-pointing finger, and streaks of Sword Intent flashed through the air, vanishing in an instant.

As the Great Sky Sword Realm surged, the Spirit Realm Network was once again strained.

Xiang Shan felt his connection with his companions flicker intermittently, his control over the construction site wavering in and out of focus. The monitoring devices and sensors struggled to maintain constant communication as the Spirit Realm signals fluctuated wildly.

At that moment, it was as if a veil had been drawn over his eyes, blurring his vision of everything around him.

But Xiang Shan paid no heed, instead channeling every ounce of his inner strength into his relentless battle against Zhang Yu.

"You want stability? I'll give you chaos!"

The earth shattered and reformed beneath his feet, the geological structure constantly shifting.

Rain and snow mingled, repeatedly extinguishing the intense heat generated by the flames.

Xiang Shan thought proudly, "Zhang Yu, last time I was too focused on combat, allowing you to claim a minor victory in construction."

"But today, with one hand controlling the earth and the other manipulating the heavens, how can you possibly compete with my construction prowess?!"

Sensing Zhang Yu's efforts to suppress the Earth Vein, Xiang Shan roared and redoubled his efforts.

During their repeated clashes, Xiang Shan suddenly sensed his opponent's power waning. A thunderous explosion erupted from deep underground, causing the ground to tremble with tenfold intensity.

Xiang Shan smirked, glancing at the fading flames in the sky. He roared, "Zhang Yu! Can't you hold on any longer?"

"You've been defeated!"

"You've been defeated by the monsterfolk you despise and look down upon!"

Xiang Shan exclaimed excitedly, "I'm going to expose everything that happened today! The world will know that you, a Refinement Apprentice from Myriad Laws University, were defeated by me, a Civil Engineering Student from Celestial Monsters University! And they'll learn just how deeply you discriminate against monsterfolk!"

Watching Xiang Shan soar into the sky, Zhang Yu calmly replied, "The one who's been defeated is you."

Xiang Shan froze momentarily. His first instinctive thought was that he was a "monster," not a "human." Was Zhang Yu's inaccurate phrasing deliberate discrimination, or merely a slip of the tongue?

Then he wondered what Zhang Yu meant by "defeated."

Before Xiang Shan could react, divine figures began flashing across the sky.

A Righteous God glared at Xiang Shan and roared, "You vile beast! How dare you conduct construction recklessly and pollute the groundwater!"

Xiang Shan blinked in surprise. "Pollute the groundwater?"

He looked at the Righteous God before him and recognized her as Deng Bingding. He quickly said, "Righteous God Deng, I..."

"What 'I'?" Deng Bingding snapped coldly. "Do you think this is your Celestial Monsters University, where you can pollute at will without consequence?"

"Don't you know there's a medicinal field just a few kilometers away? If the groundwater contamination causes any damage to the field, selling you wouldn't even cover the losses!"

Just then, as Zhang Yu withdrew his Sword Realm, Xiang Shan regained awareness of the situation across the construction site.

He discovered that, unnoticed, vast quantities of paint, wastewater, construction debris, and even Living Stakes had been dumped into the groundwater.

Xiang Shan immediately understood: Zhang Yu had deliberately withdrawn the Earth Vein suppression, allowing him to breach the bedrock and send the pollutants cascading into the depths.

But these materials should have been properly stored according to regulations. How could they have leaked so easily?
