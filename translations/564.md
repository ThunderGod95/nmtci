# Chapter 564: The Dark Reincarnation Realm

In the Dark Spirit Realm, the Joy God faced the Fortune God's question with a smile, remaining silent for a long moment before slowly replying, "To accomplish such a monumental feat, we certainly aren't acting alone."

"Fortune God, consider this carefully: if we could control the sect's reincarnated disciples, even convert them into our followers, imagine the immense benefits we would reap."

"Think of the wealth they secretly hoard to facilitate their reincarnations — an immeasurable treasure trove of resources."

"And that's not even mentioning the advantages we'd gain by infiltrating the sects through them. How much of the sects' resources could we seize?"

"Furthermore, by seizing Divine Monarch Jade Nectar, the Dark Reincarnation Realm would become the supreme authority. No matter which reincarnation path they choose to evade the Five Taxes of Heavenly Beings, we'll have them cornered."

"We'll obtain the reincarnation lists of countless sect members from the past and future, along with irrefutable evidence of their tax evasion..."

Hearing this, Lady Fortune's heart pounded violently. She thought to herself, "If they're discovered, their first reaction will be to crush you all."

"These young upstarts are far too audacious."

"Have Evil Gods become this formidable now?"

But seeing the other party's unwavering confidence, Lady Fortune wondered, "Could this be just empty bravado?"

She recalled her own past presentations to the Evil God Kings and her colleagues, where she had exaggerated projects to absurd lengths. A simple phone scam would be portrayed as a plan to destroy the Heavenly Court, and a fraudulent website would be touted as the ultimate weapon of the Spirit Realm.

"Damn it... could this guy be deliberately overhyping things to recruit me?"

Lady Fortune, projecting her own tactics onto others, considered this a likely possibility.

Yet other explanations remained.

"There might be even more powerful Evil Gods behind this, perhaps even one of the Evil God Kings driving the operation. They've already infiltrated some sects and established a foothold within certain factions."

At this thought, Lady Fortune's greed surged. Just imagining uncovering the hidden wealth of the Mighty Reincarnations made her crave a share of the spoils.

She had to admit, the plan was too tempting, the potential profits too immense. She couldn't resist the urge to get involved.

At the same time, Lady Fortune understood that as an Evil God, the other party's claims couldn't be taken at face value.

"The target is the Mighty Reincarnations through Divine Monarch Jade Nectar. That much is almost certain."

"But whether they're infiltrating the sects, controlling the Dark Reincarnation Realm, or any of that... we can't know for sure."

"Only they themselves know their true ultimate goal."

As Zhang Yu listened to the Joy God's words, he was both deeply shaken and intensely wary.

"Is this something we should get involved in?"

Sensing Lady Fortune's hesitation, the Joy God said, "Don't be so tense. We're not declaring war on the sects tomorrow."

"Whether it's tracking down the Mighty Reincarnations, finding evidence of tax evasion by Heavenly Beings, obtaining Divine Monarch Jade Nectar's ledgers, controlling Divine Monarch Jade Nectar, or controlling the Mighty Reincarnations... all of this is a long-term process, a grand scheme, and a plan that requires extreme patience."

"Each step may take years, even decades. We need to lay our plans carefully, wait patiently, and gradually reap the rewards."

"For example, gathering information on Soul Transformation Bionics at Myriad Laws University — we're prepared to spend several years on that alone."

"Throughout this long-term plan, Fortune God, you can join or withdraw at any time."

Hearing this, Zhang Yu pondered inwardly, "Lady Fortune, what do you think?"

Lady Fortune nodded slightly in her mind. "He's right about one thing. This plan is far too protracted. The ultimate benefits are beyond our current consideration; it's more like a banner to rally the Evil Gods."

"However, during the plan's execution, we can gain tangible benefits through transactions and mutual assistance with them."

"Besides, in the Dark Spirit Realm, they can't trace my origins anyway."

After a brief mental consultation, Lady Fortune said, "Alright, count me in for now."

"Tell me what kind of assistance you need."

The Joy God replied, "We want you to help us steal a document from the Finance Department."

Lady Fortune thought to herself, "How am I supposed to do that?"

But she said calmly, "Oh? The Finance Department's security is quite formidable. If you want my help, what are you willing to offer?"

Joy God said, "No need to take unnecessary risks. Our operative successfully retrieved the data earlier, but he got trapped during the retreat."

"Before being captured, he hid the data in a concealed location."

"All I need your people to do is retrieve it from there."

Examining the coordinates provided, Zhang Yu frowned. "The Spirit Realm Information Center in University City? Did they steal this data during their last attack on the city but failed to extract it successfully?"

Lady Fortune interjected, "The Information Center? That place is heavily guarded. Sending someone in to steal something would be too dangerous."

Joy God clarified, "It's not about stealing. We just need your people to retrieve what's already there."

After some negotiation, Joy God agreed to provide a piece of Spirit Realm Hijacking Technology upon successful completion of the mission.

Lady Fortune had been coveting such technology ever since witnessing the Demonic Sect's Spirit Realm hijacking of University City. Though this was only a small piece of the technology, it still piqued her interest greatly.

The only remaining question was how to accomplish this task.

---

Several days later.

At the construction site.

Zhang Yu took a few steps, his figure disappearing from the surveillance cameras.

Picking up a Relic that had fallen into a gap in the spiritual energy circuit, Zhang Yu thought, "Is this it?"

Zhang Yu had gained access so easily because University City was undergoing a massive infrastructure boom, with countless facilities damaged in battles being repaired or rebuilt.

Critical facilities like the Information Center could only be worked on by Myriad Laws University's own construction companies.

Zhang Yu's company had recently secured this project through Director Gao.

After leaving the construction site, Zhang Yu sensed the faint fluctuations of magic power within the Relic and mused, "Is the stolen data stored here?"

"Data stored using magic power frequencies," Lady Fortune said. "Heh heh, this encryption method looks familiar. Let's see what they took."

As Lady Fortune's Evil God Power flowed into the Relic, vast amounts of information were extracted and amplified, appearing as streams of data within Zhang Yu's Bionic Eye.

Zhang Yu frowned. "This is..."

"Financial flows from the Finance Department," Lady Fortune said.

"Hmm, it seems they've been exchanging funds with Celestial Monsters University for quite some time."

"Huh? There are also several strange accounts secretly transferring money to someone."

Zhang Yu's mind raced. "Could the Finance Department also be involved with the Mighty Reincarnations? Are they hiding their wealth and transferring Spirit Coins for them?"

Lady Fortune sighed. "It's hard to say with just this data. This is likely only a fragment; the rest has probably already been taken."

---

In the Dark Spirit Realm, Joy God smiled at Fortune God and said, "We've retrieved the item from the location you specified."

Meanwhile, Joy God thought to himself, "The Information Center is a critical facility, naturally not accessible to just anyone. Fortune God's swift success proves his deep influence within University City and the ability of his followers to infiltrate key positions."

Realizing this, the Joy God felt he had made the right choice in recruiting the Fortune God.

Lady Fortune said, "Enough talk. Transfer the technology now. Let me make this clear: if you send me technology I already know, it won't count."

Joy God chuckled. "Rest assured, Fortune God. This Spirit Realm Hijacking Technology, a new surrogate technique developed by the upper-tier Evil Gods, will certainly satisfy you."

The moment Lady Fortune received the transmitted information, she felt a slight tremor in her heart. "A technique that can temporarily alter displayed data?"

Zhang Yu thought, "With this technology, we could display any ranking we want? Claim affiliation with any university? It's perfect for impersonating others."

Lady Fortune: "This technique... as long as it doesn't attract the attention of the Righteous Gods, it should remain undetected."

Both Zhang Yu and Lady Fortune were highly satisfied with the Spirit Realm surrogate technology they had acquired.

Before leaving the Dark Spirit Realm, Lady Fortune couldn't resist probing, "Is the Myriad Laws Finance Department also investigating Mighty Reincarnations?"

Joy God replied flatly, "I'm sorry, Fortune God, but I cannot answer that question."

---

"Is this really dual cultivation?"

"It feels more like Dual Rest to me."

Through the video recorded by the Bionic Eye Recorder, Zhang Yu watched Shui Haiyu speak with deep suspicion. "Could they be using the guise of dual cultivation to secretly spread the teachings of the Demonic Sect?"

Shui Haiyu reported the club, and the Patrol Team conducted an investigation, but found no trace of the Dual Rest Cult.

Despite this, Shui Haiyu confronted the club leader, intending to withdraw from the group.

He then approached his classmates, urging them to quit as well.

"If you want to leave, go ahead. I like the atmosphere here and don't want to leave."

"Don't you find it strange? The club keeps asking us to skip classes for activities. It's exactly the kind of tactic the school warned us about — the Dual Rest Cult's method of indoctrinating followers."

The video ended with Shui Haiyu arguing with his classmates.

Zhang Yu watched the footage, unsure whether Shui Haiyu's suspicions were justified.

However, his role was merely to gather intelligence on Junior College Student life, not to intervene.

After quickly reviewing the day's video reports, Zhang Yu refocused his attention on the flying sword before him.

With the final restriction sealed, on this late April day, Zhang Yu's Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword finally reached Level 11, entering the Foundation Establishment realm.

At Zhang Yu's mental command, a majestic Sword Intent surged from the blade.

Zi Yunzhen, standing nearby, was secretly astonished. "The Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword has reached Level 11? It seems it has successfully condensed Sword Intent."

Zi Yunzhen knew that the Great Sun Sacred Law Flying Sword could condense a Great Sun Moral Sword Intent. This Sword Intent's destructive power increased exponentially against those deemed immoral.

But what constituted an immoral person? While there were many criteria, Zi Yunzhen believed it could be summarized in a single sentence.

She thought to herself, "The poorer someone is, the less moral they are, and the more susceptible they become to the Great Sun Moral Sword Intent."

Zhang Yu mused inwardly, "The condensation of Sword Intent is also influenced by the refiner's mindset. The Great Sun Moral Sword Intent I refined... its effects might be slightly different. I'll need to test it later."

Having completed this milestone, Zhang Yu finally breathed a sigh of relief. He glanced at the messages in his Bionic Eye and noticed Ye Xingli had sent another design draft.

Over the past few weeks, as he continued gathering intelligence from the Vocational College, Ye Xingli had been tirelessly designing Qi Refining products. Her design drafts were now approaching perfection.

"It looks like she's almost finished," Zhang Yu realized. If he didn't intervene soon, he would miss the perfect opportunity to replicate Ye Xingli's Dao Seed.

Without hesitation, he activated the Encyclopedia of Celestial Technology and began modifying the design draft before him.

Objective: Reduce costs!
