[83] "Rest assured, you haven't come to the wrong place. We know you are male, and while our school is an all-girls institution, we never discriminate against men. As long as you complete gender reassignment surgery, not only will you be able to enroll, but you will also be considered a promising student with a resolute Dao heart, with the opportunity to enter the key class to study the Primordial Yin Qi Refining Art..."
[241] "Mom, I can't stop this medicine. If I do, my Dao heart will regress, and all my previous efforts will be wasted..."

[257] Bai Zhenzhen clutched her head. "In a situation like that, forget about cultivation resources; it'll be hard to even maintain a stable Dao heart. Your grades will only get worse, and eventually, you'll fall below the elimination line, forced to leave Songyang High School with a body full of ailments and a mountain of debt."

# Chapter 3

[33] The key metrics that determined which Immortal Dao realm a person could ascend to were their Dao heart level and their mana level.
[35] For high school students, only by surpassing a level 10 Dao heart and exceeding 60 points of mana could one break through from the Qi Refinement realm to the Foundation Establishment realm.
[39] After all, a powerful physical body not only increased the efficiency of mana growth but was also a great help in forging the strong will required for one's Dao heart level, and it could enhance one's practical combat ability in the Qi Refinement realm.
[41] If the Dao heart and mana were the foundation of the Immortal Dao, then the physical strength trained in P.E. class was the foundation of the foundation.
[61] This metric, just like the Dao heart, could only reach a maximum of level 10 in the Qi Refinement realm.

# Chapter 4

[45] Besides the morning PE class, his Immortal Dao grades were divided into four subjects: Dao heart, mana, martial arts, and Daoist arts.
[47] Dao heart was worth 150 points, mana was worth 150 points, martial arts 100 points, and Daoist arts 100 points.

[31] [Dao Heart: Level 1]
[43] “The top section shows my stats for the Immortal Dao, and the Dao heart level here is just like the school’s test—it can’t be measured to a decimal place.”
[47] Among the four skills listed below, aside from the Thirty-Six Body-Strengthening Forms used for body tempering, there was also Freehand Combat from his martial arts class for practical combat training, the Basic Breathing Technique from mana class for refining mana, and the Basic Heart Tempering Art for improving his Dao heart, all at the novice Level 1.

[117] "It's still too difficult for beginners to master 113. Should we recruit a batch of test subjects with a higher Dao heart level?"
[123] "Besides, those with higher Dao heart levels have better cultivation techniques to learn; 113's passive breathing effect isn't competitive for them. It's beginners who need this passive effect the most..."

[95] "It's too tragic! I can already see you being ruthlessly crushed under the feet of the prodigies from other schools, your Dao heart shattered, looking just like a dead dog."

[39] "However, this painting contains a trace of the martial will left by my father. Viewing it will subject you to the impact of this will, and there is a danger of damaging your Dao heart."

[1] # Chapter 19: Terror and the Dao Heart
[37] Li Xuelian did not answer his question directly, stating instead, "The first trial of the Celestial Paragon’s Martial Demonstration Scroll tests the Dao heart."
[39] "Those who cannot withstand it are often forcibly repelled, and may even be left with a flaw in their Dao heart."
[51] At the exhibition, Li Xuelian continued, "Passing this first trial naturally has the effect of tempering one's Dao heart."
[53] "As for the Dao heart level, the vast majority of us cultivators rely on cultivation techniques to raise it."
[63] "There are countless cultivation techniques to elevate the Dao heart, some profound and some basic, but the key is whether the practitioner possesses a mindset compatible with the technique."
[67] "Fortunately, the stronger the Dao heart, the stronger one's willpower. Thus, measuring the strength of one's willpower to determine their Dao heart level and test the efficacy of their cultivation technique has become the simplest method."
[69] "But the Celestial Paragon’s Martial Demonstration Scroll does not simply test the strength of one's willpower to ascertain the strength of their Dao heart."
[87] "Having excellent scores and a fixation on them can strengthen a top student's will, which in turn makes it easier to raise their Dao heart level."
[183] Back at the exhibition, Li Xuelian remarked with a sigh, "But whether it's wishful thinking, lying flat, or being a deadbeat, these are merely mental states used to counteract immense pressure. While they can temper one's will and Dao heart, their future ultimately depends on the path they walk in reality."
[187] She recalled when she was in high school, and her father had also tested her Dao heart.
[193] The Songyang City Director of the Immortal Resonance Group, standing beside her, nodded slightly, knowing she was right; the effects of such a Dao heart trial were only temporary.
[195] After all, a person's thoughts are constantly changing; how could the fleeting influence of a Dao heart trial withstand the long-lasting impact of the real world and society at large?

[103] But having just had his Dao heart tempered by the Celestial Paragon’s Martial Demonstration Scroll, Qian Shen's courage was at its absolute peak.

# Chapter 21

[61] The killing intent to shatter an army of thousands, the fighting spirit that would not regret nine deaths, the imposing aura to forge ever forward... the nine martial arts cultivated martial will, and through it, fortified one's Dao heart.
[63] "This isn't a martial art for combat or body tempering, but one that uses martial will to temper the Dao heart."
[65] This was a martial heart technique used to raise the level of one's Dao heart!
[69] The most fundamental function of martial will was to strengthen the spirit and solidify one's own will, thereby raising a cultivator's Dao heart level.
[91] Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art Level 0 (1/1, 8.3/8 mana, 0.85/0.8 physical strength, 1/3 Dao heart)
[97] And unlike the martial arts Zhang Yu had learned before, this Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art had requirements for mana, physical strength, and Dao heart.
[99] "Besides having to practice all the forms like the fist, palm, and leg arts, it also requires 8 mana, a physical strength of 0.8, and a level 3 Dao heart."
[101] "I already meet the other requirements, but this level 3 Dao heart..."
[103] Zhang Yu's own Dao heart was only level 1.
[107] "This Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art, it seems for now, is a martial art meant for after reaching a level 3 Dao heart, used to condense martial will, fortify the mind with that martial will, and temper the Dao heart."
[109] *Such a high requirement of a level 3 Dao heart… is that even achievable for a first-year high school student only three months into the school year?*

[29] But since his Dao heart was not yet level three, he couldn't practice the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art anyway, and he needed to prepare for the Mana Competition by increasing his mana.
[165] After all, besides him, no one at the school knew the true difficulty and power of the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art, much less that it required a level three Dao heart.

[11] But the monthly exams also included physical education, Dao heart, martial arts, and Daoist arts in addition to mana, and the thought of having to drastically improve in these four areas over the next two weeks instantly filled Zhang Yu with immense pressure.

# Chapter 26

[103] _To improve my exam results from here, I'll have to focus on my Dao heart, physical education, martial arts, and Daoist arts._
[105] _For my Dao heart… while I haven't mastered the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art, I have fully grasped its principles. That should be enough to earn a good score on the Dao heart portion of the exam._

[7] Su Haifeng stared at a list on his computer screen as he spoke into the phone, "Hmm... his Dao heart score hasn't changed."

[7] If the five major subjects of the high school Immortal Dao—Dao heart, mana, and physical education—were considered foundational, then martial arts and Daoist arts were the practical application of those immortal techniques.

# Chapter 30

[1] # Chapter 30: A Contest of Palm Force and the Dao Heart Examination
[139] The next day would be the examinations for Dao heart, mana, and physical strength.
[173] After breakfast, Zhang Yu made his way to the examination hall for the first test of the day: the Dao heart examination.
[191] "This is the unified monthly Dao heart examination for all high schools in Songyang City. The examination will last for sixty minutes."
[197] Unlike the previous day's general knowledge, martial arts, and Daoist arts exams, the Dao heart portion of the monthly exam was always a unified test for all high schools across Songyang City.
[199] This was intrinsically linked to the special nature of the Dao heart itself and its examination.
[221] "The Dao heart examination will now begin."

# Chapter 31

[47] Due to the unique nature of soul cultivators, they were not required to participate in this Dao heart examination and were instead conscripted by the teachers to act as proctors.
[67] The strength of one's will was a manifestation of the Dao heart, and determining the Dao heart level was generally done by testing the strength of that will.
[69] Therefore, the Dao heart examination primarily tested one's willpower, at least at the Qi Refinement stage.
[71] But the methods for testing each person's willpower were many and varied. To prevent examinees from undergoing targeted training beforehand and causing inaccuracies in the results, the specific content of each Dao heart exam was different.
[73] As far as Zhang Yu knew, the more prestigious the examination, the more resources were invested into the Dao heart test, and the more complex the content experienced by the examinees in the Spirit Realm would be.
[83] Simultaneously, all the Li Xingyus spoke in unison, "Today's Dao heart examination is very simple… Pain."
[89] The Dao heart exam was graded based on ranking, so one's specific score depended not only on oneself but also on the performance of the other students.
[91] For Songyang City's monthly Dao heart exam, scores were based on the city-wide high school student rankings.
[125] What is willpower? What is thought? What is a Dao heart?
[127] The Dao heart course teacher had lectured at length, explaining how from ancient times to the present, people had worshiped gods, demons, and men… establishing all sorts of different ideologies, using different thoughts in coordination with heart arts to elevate the Dao heart and strengthen the will.
[137] But a truly sustainable, systemic ideology was something Zhang Yu did not yet possess, and it was something the school's Dao heart course had failed to teach him.
[141] The strength of will a cultivator displayed could be used to grade their Dao heart level.
[143] The ideology within a cultivator's mind could coordinate with a heart art to raise the Dao heart level, further strengthening their will.
[145] Thought as the core, will as the manifestation, and heart art as the method—the combination of these three was a cultivator's complete Dao heart.
[153] He hurriedly activated the level 1 Basic Heart Tempering Art taught in his Dao heart course, striving to stabilize his spirit.
[157] Through long-term practice, one's Dao heart level would rise, and their willpower would grow stronger.
[181] This was the standard way to improve the Dao heart; only when one's own ideology matched the heart art would the effect be optimal.
[193] Although Zhang Yu's Dao heart level was insufficient to truly master the Martial Ascension Heart-Tempering Art.
